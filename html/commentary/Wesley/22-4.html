Fair - He repeats it both to confirm his assertion, and to shew the fervency of his affection. Dove's eyes - Whereas the beauty of the spouse is here described in her several parts, we need not labour much about the application of each particular to some distinct grace of the church, this being the chief design of the description to shew that compleatness and absolute perfection which the church hath in part received, and shall more fully receive in the future life.Goats - Which in these parts was of extraordinary length, and softness, and comeliness. Mount Gilead - A very fruitful place, fit for breeding all sorts of cattle, and especially of goats, because it was an hilly and woody country.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="So4_2"><b>4:2</b></a></span></td><td><span>A flock - Numerous, and placed in due order. Even - Smooth and even, as also clean and white. Twins - Which seems to denote the two rows of teeth.

The discourse of believers is edifying and comfortable, and acceptable to God, and to serious men.Temples - Under which he comprehends the cheeks. Pomegranate - In which there is a lovely mixture of red and white.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="So4_4"><b>4:4</b></a></span></td><td><span>Thy neck - This may represent the grace of faith, by which we are united to Christ, as the body is to the head by the neck. By which Christians receive their spiritual food, and consequently their strength and ability for action.

And this place may be understood of the day of glory, when all shadows and ordinances shall cease. To the hill - To my church upon earth, which was typified by the mountain of Moriah and the temple upon it. This in prophetic writings is called a mountain, and may well be called a mountain of myrrh and frankincense, both for the acceptable services which are there offered to God, and for the precious gifts and graces of the Holy Spirit, which are of a sweet smelling savour to God and men. Thus Christ directs believers, where they may find him, namely in his church and ordinances.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="So4_8"><b>4:8</b></a></span></td><td><span>Come - Unto the mountains of myrrh. Look - To the place to which I invite thee to go, which from those high mountains thou mayest easily behold. Of Leopards - From these or other mountains, which are inhabited by lions and leopards.

The church conveys those waters of life which she receives from Christ to particular believers. Streams - Like those sweet and refreshing rivers which flow down from mount Lebanon, of which Jordan is one.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="So4_16"><b>4:16</b></a></span></td><td><span>North wind - These winds may signify the several dispensations of God's spirit. My garden - This verse is spoken by the spouse.
