Out of Egypt - But Israel, the first adopted son was a type of Christ the first - born. And the history of Israel's coming out was a type of Christ's future coming out of Egypt.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ho11_2"><b>11:2</b></a></span></td><td><span>They - Moses and Aaron, and other prophets.Called - Persuaded, intreated, and urged by exhortations, the whole house of Israel.
