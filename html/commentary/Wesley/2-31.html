Aholiab of the tribe of Dan is appointed next to Bezaleel, and partner with him.

God, by sanctifying this day among them, let them know that he sanctified them, and set them apart for his service, otherwise he would not have revealed to them his holy sabbaths to be the support of religion among them. The Jews by observing one day in seven, after six days labour, testified that they worshipped the God that made the world in six days, and rested the seventh; and so distinguished themselves from other nations, who having first lost the sabbath, the memorial of the creation, by degrees lost the knowledge of the creator, and gave the creature the honour due to him alone.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ex31_14"><b>31:14</b></a></span></td><td><span>It is holy unto you - That is, it is designed for your benefit as well as for God's honour; it shall be accounted holy by you.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ex31_15"><b>31:15</b></a></span></td><td><span>It is the sabbath of rest, holy to the Lord - It is separated from common use, for the service of God; and by the observance of it we are taught to rest from worldly pursuits, and devote ourselves, and all we are, have, and can do, to God's glory.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ex31_16"><b>31:16</b></a></span></td><td><span>It was to be observed throughout their generations, in every age, for a perpetual covenant - This was to be one of the most lasting tokens of the covenant between God and Israel.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ex31_17"><b>31:17</b></a></span></td><td><span>On the seventh day he rested - And as the work of creation is worthy to be thus commemorated, so the great Creator is worthy to be thus imitated, by a holy rest the seventh day.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ex31_18"><b>31:18</b></a></span></td><td><span>These tables of stone, were not prepared by Moses, but probably by the ministry of angels. They were written with the finger of God - That is, by his will and power immediately, without the use of any instrument. They were written in two tables, being designed to direct us in our duty, towards God, and towards man. And they were called tables of testimony, because this written law testified the will of God concerning them, and would be a testimony against them if they were disobedient.</table><span><!--pageCount=1-->
