For the common people now began to drink in the poison, from these learned, good, honourable men!He hath Beelzebub - at command, is in league with him: And by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils - How easily may a man of learning elude the strongest proof of a work of God! How readily can he account for every incident without ever taking God into the question.     <a href="/matthew/12-24.html">Matthew 12:24</a> ; Lu 11:15.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mr3_28"><b>3:28</b></a></span></td><td><span>  <a href="/matthew/12-31.html">Matthew 12:31</a> ; Lu 12:10.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mr3_30"><b>3:30</b></a></span></td><td><span>Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit - Is it not astonishing, that men who have ever read these words, should doubt, what is the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost?
