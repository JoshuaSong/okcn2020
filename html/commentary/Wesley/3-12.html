Her infirmity - Her monthly infirmity. And it may note an agreement therewith not only in the time,  <a href="/leviticus/15-19.html">Leviticus 15:19</a> , but in the degree of uncleanness.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Le12_4"><b>12:4</b></a></span></td><td><span>In the blood of her purifying - In her polluted and separated estate; for the word blood or bloods signifies both guilt, and uncleanness, as here and elsewhere. And it is called the blood of her purifying, because by the expulsion or purgation of that blood, which is done by degrees, she is purified. No hallowed thing - She shall not eat any part of the peace - offerings which she or her husband offered, which otherwise she might have done; and, if she be a priest's wife, she shall not eat any of the tythes or first fruits, or part of the hallowed meats, which at other times she together with her husband might eat.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Le12_5"><b>12:5</b></a></span></td><td><span>Threescore and six days - The time in both particulars is double to the former, not so much from natural causes, as to put an honour upon the sacrament of circumcision, which being administered to the males, did put an end to that pollution sooner than otherwise had been.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Le12_6"><b>12:6</b></a></span></td><td><span>For a son or a daughter - For the birth of a son, or of a daughter: but the purification was for herself, as appears from the following verses. A sin - offering - Because of her ceremonial uncleanness, which required a ceremonial expiation.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Le12_8"><b>12:8</b></a></span></td><td><span>The morality of this law obliges women who have received mercies from God in child - bearing, with all thankfulness to acknowledge his goodness to them, owning themselves unworthy of it, and (which is the best purification) to continue in faith, and love, and holiness, with sobriety.</table><span><!--pageCount=1-->
