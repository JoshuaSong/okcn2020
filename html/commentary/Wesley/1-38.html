		<span><span><center><b>The Book of Genesis<br>Chapter 38</b></center></span><p><span><b>Chapter Overview:</B></span><blockquote><br>How little reason had the Jews, who were so called from this Judah, to boast, as they did, that they were not born of fornication?  <a href="/john/8-41.html"> 8:41</a> .<br>We have in this chapter, <ol><li type=I> Judah's marriage and issue, and the untimely death of his two   eldest sons, ver. 1 - 11.<br><li type=I> Judah's incest with his daughter - in - law Tamar, ver. 12 - 23.<br><li type=I> His confusion when it was discovered, ver. 24 - 26.<br><li type=I> The birth of his twin sons in whom his family was built up,   ver. 27 - 30.<br></ol></BLOCKQUOTE><span><b>Verses:</B></span><br><TABLE WIDTH="100%" CELLPADDING="4" CELLSPACING="0" BORDER="0"><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ge38_1"><b>38:1</b></a></span></td><td><span>Judah went down from his brethren - Withdrew for a time from his father's family, and got intimately acquainted with one Hirah an Adullamite. When young people that have been well educated begin to change their company, they will soon change their manners, and lose their good education. They that go down from their brethren, that forsake the society of the seed of Israel, and pick up Canaanites for their companions, are going down the hill apace.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ge38_2"><b>38:2</b></a></span></td><td><span>He took her - To wife. His father, it should seem, was not consulted, but by his new friend Hirah.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ge38_7"><b>38:7</b></a></span></td><td><span>And Er was wicked in the sight of the Lord - That is, in defiance of God and his law. And what came of it? Why God cut him off presently, The Lord slew him. The next brother Onan was, according to the ancient usage, married to the widow, to preserve the name of his deceased brother that died childless. This custom of marrying the brother's widow was afterward made one of the laws of Moses,  <a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.html">Deuteronomy 25:5</a> .Onan, though he consented to marry the widow, yet to the great abuse of his own body, of the wife he had married, and the memory of his brother that was gone, he refused to raise up seed unto his brother. Those sins that dishonour the body are very displeasing to God, and the evidence of vile actions. Observe, the thing which he did displeased the Lord - And it is to be feared, thousands, especially of single persons, by this very thing, still displeased the Lord, and destroy their own souls.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ge38_11"><b>38:11</b></a></span></td><td><span>Shelah the third son was reserved for the widow, yet with design that he should not marry so young as his brothers had done, lest he die also. Some think that Judah never intended to marry Shelah to Tamar, but unjustly suspected her to have been the death of her two former husbands, (whereas it was their own wickedness that slew them) and then sent her to her father's house, with a charge to remain a widow. If so, it was an inexcusable piece of prevarication; however Tamar acquiesced, and waited for the issue.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ge38_14"><b>38:14</b></a></span></td><td><span>Some excuse this by suggesting that she believed the promise made to Abraham and his seed, particularly that of the Messiah, and that she was therefore desirous to have a child by one of that family, that she might have the honour, or at least stand fair for the honour of being the mother of the Messiah. She covered her with a veil - It was the custom of harlots in those times to cover their faces, that tho' they were not ashamed, yet they might seem to be so: the sin of uncleanness did not then go so bare - faced as it now doth.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ge38_17"><b>38:17</b></a></span></td><td><span>A kid from the flock - A goodly price at which her chastity and honour were valued! Had the consideration been thousands of rams, and ten thousand rivers of oil, it had not been a valuable consideration. The favour of God, the purity of the soul, the peace of the conscience, and the hope of heaven: are too precious to be exposed to sale at any such rates.He lost his Jewels by the bargain: He sent the kid according to his promise, to redeem his pawn, but the supposed harlot could not be found. He sent it by his friend, (who was indeed his back - friend, because he was aiding and abetting in his evil deeds) the Adullamite; who came back without the pledge. 'Tis a good account, if it be but true, of any place that which they here gave, that there is no harlot in this place, for such sinners are the scandals and plagues of any place. Judah sits down content to lose his signet and his bracelets, and forbids his friend to make any farther enquiry.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ge38_23"><b>38:23</b></a></span></td><td><span>Lest we be shamed - Either, <ol><li> Lest his sin should come to be known publicly,Or <li> Lest he should be laughed at as a fool for trusting a whore with hissignet and his bracelets. He expresses no concern about the sin, only about the shame. There are many who are more solicitous to preserve their reputation with men, than to secure the savour of God, lest we be shamed goes farther with them than lest we be damned.</ol><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ge38_28"><b>38:28</b></a></span></td><td><span>It should seem the birth was hard to the mother, by which she was corrected for her sin: the children also, like Jacob and Esau, struggled for the birth - right, and Pharez who got it, is ever named first, and from him Christ descended. He had his name from his breaking forth before his brother; this breach be upon thee - The Jews, as Zarah, bid fair for the birth - right, and were marked with a scarlet thread, as those that come out first; but the Gentiles, like Pharez, or a son of violence got the start of them, by that violence which the kingdom of heaven suffers, and attained to the righteousness which the Jews came short of: yet when the fulness of time is come, all Israel shall be saved. Both these sons are named in the genealogy of our Saviour,  <a href="/matthew/1-3.html">Matthew 1:3</a> , to perpetuate the story, as an instance of the humiliation of our Lord Jesus.</table><span><!--pageCount=1-->
