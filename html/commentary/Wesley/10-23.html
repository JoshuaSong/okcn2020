When we find death approaching, we should endeavour both to honour God, and to profit others with our last words. Let those who have had experience of God's goodness, and the pleasantness of the ways of wisdom, when they come to finish their course, leave a record of those experiences, and bear their testimony to the truth of the promise.Raised - Advanced from an obscure estate, to the kingdom. Whom, God singled out from all the families of Israel, and anointed to be king.Psalmist - He who was eminent among the people of God, for composing sweet and holy songs to the praise of God, and for the use of his church in after ages: these seem not to be the words of David, but of the sacred penman of this book.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Sa23_2"><b>23:2</b></a></span></td><td><span>His word - The following words, and consequently the other words and Psalms composed and uttered by me upon the like solemn occasions, are not to be looked upon as human inventions, but both the matter and the words of them are suggested by God's spirit, the great teacher of the church.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Sa23_3"><b>23:3</b></a></span></td><td><span>Rock - He who is the strength, and defence, and protector of his people; which he manifests by directing kings and rulers so to manage their power as may most conduce to their comfort and benefit. Ruleth - Here are the two principal parts of a king's duty, answerable to the two tables of God's law, justice towards men, and piety towards God, both which he is to maintain and promote among his people.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Sa23_4"><b>23:4</b></a></span></td><td><span>Shall be - These words are a farther description of the king's duty, which is not only to rule with justice and piety, but also with sweetness, and gentleness, and condescension to the infirmities of his people; to render his government as acceptable to them, as is the sun - shine in a clear morning, or the tender grass which springs out of the earth by the warm beams of the sun after the rain.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Sa23_5"><b>23:5</b></a></span></td><td><span>Altho' - Although God knows, that neither I, nor my children have lived and ruled as we should have done, so justly, and in the fear of the Lord; and therefore have not enjoyed that uninterrupted prosperity which we might have enjoyed. Covenant - Notwithstanding all our transgressions whereby we have broken covenant with God, yet God, to whom all my sins were known, was graciously pleased to make a sure covenant, to continue the kingdom to me, and to my seed for ever, chap. <a href="/2-samuel/7-16.html">7:16</a> , until the coming of the Messiah who is to be my son and successor, and whose kingdom shall have no end. Ordered - Ordained in all points by God's eternal counsel; and disposed by his wise and powerful providence which will over - rule all things, even the sins of my house so far, that although he punished them for their sins, yet he will not utterly root them out, nor break his covenant made with me and mine. Sure - Or, preserved, by God's power and faithfulness in the midst of all oppositions. For this - Or, in this is, that is, it consists in, and depends upon this covenant.Salvation - Both mine own eternal salvation, and the preservation of the kingdom to me and mine. Tho' - Although God as yet hath not made my house or family to grow; that is, to increase, or to flourish with worldly glory as I expected; yet this is my comfort, that God will inviolably keep this covenant. But this refers also to the covenant of grace made with all believers. This is indeed an everlasting covenant, from everlasting, in the contrivance of it, and to everlasting, in the continuance and the consequence of it. It is ordered, well ordered in all things; admirably well, to advance the glory of God and the honour of the mediator, together with the holiness and happiness of believers. It is sure, and therefore sure, because well - ordered: the promised mercies are sure, on the performance of the conditions. It is all our salvation: nothing but this will save us, and this is sufficient. Therefore it should be all our desire. Let me have an interest in this covenant, and I have enough, I desire no more.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Sa23_6"><b>23:6</b></a></span></td><td><span>But - Having in the foregoing verses described the nature, and stability of that kingdom which God had by a sure covenant settled upon him and his seed; and especially, upon the Messiah, who was to be one of his posterity; he now describes the nature and miserable condition, of all the enemies of this holy and blessed kingdom. As thorns - Which men do not use to handle, but thrust them away. And so will God thrust away from himself, and from his people, and kingdom, all those who shall either secretly or openly set themselves against it.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Sa23_7"><b>23:7</b></a></span></td><td><span>Fenced - He must arm himself with some iron weapon, whereby he may cut them down; or, with the staff of a spear, or some such thing, whereby he may thrust them away from himself, that they do him no hurt.Burnt - Or, if they do not cut them down or thrust them away they will burn and consume them. The place - Or, in their place, where they grow or stand.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Sa23_8"><b>23:8</b></a></span></td><td><span>These - But this catalogue, though placed here, was taken long before, as is manifest from hence, that Asahel and Uriah are named here. And whereas there are some difference between this list, and that,  <a href="/1-chronicles/11-10.html"> 11:10</a> - 47, most of them are easily reconciled by these twoconsiderations; <ol><li> that nothing is more common than for one person to have divers names.<li> That as some of the worthies died, and others came in their stead;   this must needs cause some alteration in the latter catalogue,    <a href="/1-chronicles/11-10.html"> 11:10</a> - 47, from this which was the former.</ol> Learn hence, how much religion tends to inspire men with true courage.David both by his writings and example greatly promoted piety among the grandees of the kingdom.

For both might grow in the same field, in divers parts of it. And this fact is ascribed to Eleazar,  <a href="/1-chronicles/11-12.html">1&nbsp;Chronicles 11:12</a> , but it is implied, that he had some partner or partners in it; for it is there said, <cite>1Chr 11:14 they </cite> set themselves, &c. So Eleazar might fight in that part where thebarley was and Shammah where the lentiles were.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Sa23_12"><b>23:12</b></a></span></td><td><span>Lord wrought - How great soever the bravery of the instruments is, the praise of the achievement is to be given to God.

Poured it - As a kind of drink offering, and acknowledgment of God's goodness in preserving the lives of his captains in so dangerous an enterprize; and to shew, that he esteemed it as a sacred thing, which it was not fit for him to drink.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Sa23_17"><b>23:17</b></a></span></td><td><span>These three - Jointly: then two of them are mentioned severally.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Sa23_19"><b>23:19</b></a></span></td><td><span>Attained not - He fell short of them in strength and valour.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Sa23_21"><b>23:21</b></a></span></td><td><span>Pit - Where he put himself under a necessity, either of killing, or being killed.

Concerning which, and other changes of the names, which will be observed, by comparing this catalogue with that, it will be sufficient to suggest, <ol><li> that the same names of persons, or places, are differently pronounced   according to the different dialects of divers places or ages.<li> That one man had often two names.<li> That David had more worthies than those here mentioned; and as   some of these were slain in the former part of David's reign, as   Asahel was; so others came up in their stead; and some were added   to this number, as appears from  <a href="/1-chronicles/11-10.html">1&nbsp;Chronicles 11:10</a> - 47, where they are   named, but not numbered, as they were here; and where there is a   greater number than is here expressed.</table><!--pageCount=1-->
