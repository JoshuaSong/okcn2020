He set the bounds - That is, he disposed of the several lands and limits of the people so as to reserve a sufficient place for the great numbers of the people of Israel. And therefore he so guided the hearts of several people, that the posterity of Canaan, which was accursed of God, and devoted to ruin, should be seated in that country which God intended for the children of Israel, that so when their iniquities were ripe, they might be rooted out, and the Israelites come in their stead.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="De32_9"><b>32:9</b></a></span></td><td><span>His people - It is no wonder God had so great a regard to this people, for he chose them out of all mankind to be his peculiar portion.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="De32_10"><b>32:10</b></a></span></td><td><span>He found him - Not by chance, but as it were looking out and seeking for him. He did indeed manifest himself to him in Egypt, but it was in the wilderness at Sinai, God found him in an eminent manner, and revealed his will to him, and entered into covenant with him, and imparted himself and his grace and blessing to him. By this word he also signifies both their lost condition in themselves, and that their recovery was not from themselves, but only from God who sought and found them out by his grace. In the waste howling wilderness - In a place destitute of all the necessaries and comforts of life, which also was a type of that desolate and comfortless condition in which all men are before the grace of God finds them out; where instead of the voices of men, is nothing heard but the howlings and yellings of ravenous birds and beasts. He led them - He conducted them frons place to place by his cloudy pillar and providence.Or, he compassed him about, by his provident care, watching over him and preserving him on every side. As the apple of his eye - As men use to keep the apple of their eye, that is, with singular care and diligence, this being as a most tender, so a most useful part.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="De32_11"><b>32:11</b></a></span></td><td><span>Her nest - Her young ones in the nest; which she by her cry and motion provoketh to fly. Her wings - As preparing herself to fly.On her wings - Or, as on her wings, that is, gently, and tenderly and safely too, as if she carried them not in her claws for fear of hurting them, but upon her wings. Some say, the eagle doth usually carry her young ones upon her wings.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="De32_12"><b>32:12</b></a></span></td><td><span>Did lead them - When they were shut up in Egypt as in their nest whence they durst not venture to fly nor stir, he taught and encouraged and enabled them to fly out from that bondage, he dealt tenderly with them, bearing with their infirmities, keeping them from all harms. With him - To assist him at that work or to deliver them. The more unworthy they in giving to idols a share in that worship which they owe to God only.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="De32_13"><b>32:13</b></a></span></td><td><span>The high places - To conquer their strongest holds, which often are in the mountains, and their cities fenced with walls of greatest height and strength.

And withall it implies the ground of his anger, their falseness to God whom they had accepted as their husband, and their spiritual whoredom with other gods.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="De32_17"><b>32:17</b></a></span></td><td><span>Unto devils - Unto idols, which the devils brought into the world in opposition to God, in and by which the devils often manifested themselves to men, and gave them answers, and received their worship. The Gentiles pretended to worship God in those idols, and the devils which inspired them, deluded the nations with pretences that they were a sort of lower gods.Moses takes off this mark, and shews the Israelites that these pretended gods were really devils, and therefore that it was the height of madness to honour or worship them. Not to God - For God utterly rejected those sacrifices which they offered to him together with idols.They knew not - Or, who never knew them, that is, never shewed any kindness to them, or did them any good: New gods - Not simply or absolutely, for some of these had been worshipped for many generations, but comparatively to the true God, who is the ancient of days,  <a href="/deuteronomy/7-9.html">Deuteronomy 7:9</a> , and who was worshipped from the beginning of the world.Feared not - Served not, worshipped not.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="De32_18"><b>32:18</b></a></span></td><td><span>Of the rock - Of God, one of whose titles this is, or of Christ, who is called the rock,  <a href="/1-corinthians/10-4.html"> 10:4</a> , whom the Israelites tempted.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="De32_19"><b>32:19</b></a></span></td><td><span>His sons and daughters - Such they were by calling and profession.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="De32_20"><b>32:20</b></a></span></td><td><span>I will see - I will make them and others see, what the fruit of such actions shall be.

And yet these people I will take in your stead, receive them and reject you; which, when it came to pass how desperately did it provoke the Jews to jealousy? A foolish nation - So the Gentiles were both in the opinion of the Jews and in truth and reality, notwithstanding all their pretences to wisdom, there being nothing more foolish or brutish than the worship of idols.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="De32_22"><b>32:22</b></a></span></td><td><span>A fire is kindled - Great and grievous judgments shall be inflicted, which often come under the name of fire.

Their vine is of the vine of Sodom - The people of Israel, which I planted as a choice vine, are now degenerated and become like the vine of Sodom, their principles and practices are all corrupt and abominable. Bitter - Their fruits are loathsome to me, mischievous to others, and at last will be pernicious to themselves.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="De32_34"><b>32:34</b></a></span></td><td><span>This - All their wickedness mentioned before. My long suffering towards them may make them think I have forgotten their sins, but I remember them punctually, they are sealed up as in a bag,  <a href="/job/14-17.html">Job 14:17</a> , and as men seal up their treasures.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="De32_35"><b>32:35</b></a></span></td><td><span>Their feet shall slide - They who now think they stand fast and unmoveable, shall fall into utter destruction. In due time - Though not so soon as some may expect, yet in that time when it shall be most proper, when they have filled up the measure of their sins. At hand - Heb.is near. So the scripture often speaks of those things which are at many hundred years distance, to signify, that though they may be afar off as to our measures of time, yet in God's account they are near, they are as near as may be, when the measure of their sins is once full, the judgment shall not be deferred.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="De32_36"><b>32:36</b></a></span></td><td><span>For - Or, nevertheless, having spoken of the dreadful calamity which would come upon his people, he now turns his discourse into a more comfortable strain, and begins to shew that after God had sorely chastised his people, he would have mercy upon them and turn their captivity. Judge his people - Shall plead their cause, shall protect and deliver them. Repent - Of the evils he hath brought upon them. None shut up - Either in their strong cities or castles or other hiding places, or in the enemies hands or prisons, whence there might be some hope or possibility of redemption; and none left, as the poor and contemptible people are neglected and usually left by the conquerors in the conquered land, but all seem to be cut off and destroyed.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="De32_37"><b>32:37</b></a></span></td><td><span>He shall say - The Lord, before he deliver his people, will first convince them of their former folly in forsaking him and following idols.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="De32_38"><b>32:38</b></a></span></td><td><span>Which did eat - That is, to whom you offered sacrifices and oblations after the manner of the Gentiles.

Probably Moses spoke it to as many as could hear him, while Joshua in another assembly at the same time delivered it to as many as his voice would reach.
