Moreover, Izhar was the second son of Kohath, whereas Elizaphan, whom Moses had preferred before him, and made prince or ruler of the Kohathites,  <a href="/numbers/3-30.html">Numbers 3:30</a> , was the son of Uzziel, the fourth son of Kohath. This, the Jewish writers say, made him malcontent, which at last broke forth into sedition. Sons of Reuben - These are drawn into confederacy with Korah, partly because they were his next neighbours, both being encamped on the south - side, partly in hopes to recover their rights of primogeniture, in which the priesthood was comprehended, which was given away from their father.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu16_2"><b>16:2</b></a></span></td><td><span>Rose up - That is, conspired together, and put their design in execution. Before Moses - Not obscurely, but openly and boldly, not fearing nor regarding the presence of Moses.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu16_3"><b>16:3</b></a></span></td><td><span>They - Korah, Dathan and Abiram, and the rest, who were all together when Moses spake those words,  <a href="/numbers/16-5.html">Numbers 16:5</a> - 7, but after that, Dathan and Abiram retired to their tents, and then Moses sent for Korah and the Levites, who had more colourable pretences to the priesthood, and treats with them apart, and speaks what is mentioned,  <a href="/numbers/16-8.html">Numbers 16:8</a> - 11. Having dispatched them, he sends forDathan and Abiram,  <a href="/numbers/16-12.html">Numbers 16:12</a> , that he might reason the case with them also apart. Against Aaron - To whom the priesthood was confined, and against Moses, both because this was done by his order, and because before Aaron's consecration Moses appropriated it to himself. For whatever they intended, they seem not now directly to strike at Moses for his supreme civil government, but only for his influence in the disposal of the priesthood. Ye take too much - By perpetuating the priesthood in yourselves and family, with the exclusion of all others from it. All are holy - A kingdom of priests, an holy nation, as they are called,  <a href="/exodus/19-6.html"> 19:6</a> , a people separated to the service of God, and therefore noless fit to offer sacrifice and incense, than you are. Among them - By his tabernacle and cloud, the tokens of his gracious presence, and therefore ready to receive sacrifices from their own hands. Ye - Thou Moses, by prescribing what laws thou pleasest about the priesthood, and confining it to thy brother; and thou Aaron by usurping it as thy peculiar privilege.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu16_4"><b>16:4</b></a></span></td><td><span>On his face - Humbly begging that God would direct and vindicate him. Accordingly God answers his prayers, and strengthens him with new courage, and confidence of success.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu16_5"><b>16:5</b></a></span></td><td><span>To - morrow - Heb. In the morning, the time appointed by men for administering justice, and chosen by God for that work. Some time is allowed, partly that Korah and his company might prepare themselves and their censers, and partly to give them space for consideration and repentance. He will cause him - He will by some evident token declare his approbation of him and his ministry.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu16_8"><b>16:8</b></a></span></td><td><span>Ye sons of Levi - They were of his own tribe, nay, they were of God's tribe. It was therefore the worse in them thus to mutiny against God and against him.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu16_9"><b>16:9</b></a></span></td><td><span>To minister to them - So they were the servants both of God and of the church, which was an high dignity, though not sufficient for their ambitious minds.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu16_11"><b>16:11</b></a></span></td><td><span>Against the Lord - Whose chosen servant Aaron is. You strike at God through Aaron's sides.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu16_12"><b>16:12</b></a></span></td><td><span>Dathan and Abiram - To treat with them and give them, as he had done Korah and his company, a timely admonition. Come up - To Moses's tabernacle, whither the people used to go up for judgment.Men are said in scripture phrase to go up to places of judgment.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu16_14"><b>16:14</b></a></span></td><td><span>These men - Of all the people who are of our mind: wilt thou make them blind, or persuade them that they do not see what is visible to all that have eyes, to wit, that thou hast deceived them, and broken thy faith and promise given to them?</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu16_15"><b>16:15</b></a></span></td><td><span>Respect not their offering - Accept not their incense which they are now going to offer, but shew some eminent dislike of it. He calls it their offering, though it was offered by Korah and his companions, because it was offered in the name and by the consent of all the conspirators, for the decision of the present controversy between them and Moses. I have not hurt one of them - I have never injured them, nor used my power to defraud or oppress them, as I might have done; I have done them many good offices, but no hurt: therefore their crime is without any cause or provocation.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu16_16"><b>16:16</b></a></span></td><td><span>Before the Lord - Not in the tabernacle, which was not capable of so many persons severally offering incense, but at the door of the tabernacle, where they might offer it by Moses's direction upon this extraordinary occasion. This work could not be done in that place, which alone was allowed for the offering up of incense; not only for its smallness, but also because none but priests might enter to do this work.Here also the people, who were to be instructed by this experiment, might see the proof and success of it.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu16_18"><b>16:18</b></a></span></td><td><span>Fire - Taken from the altar which stood in that place, for Aaron might not use other fire. And it is likely the rememberance of the death of Nadab and Abihu deterred them from offering any strange fire.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu16_19"><b>16:19</b></a></span></td><td><span>Against them - That they might be witnesses of the event, and, upon their success, which they doubted not of, might fall upon Moses and Aaron. And it seems by this that the people were generally incensed against Moses, and inclined to Korah's side. The glory appeared  - In the cloud, which then shone with greater brightness and majesty, as atoken of God's approach and presence.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu16_22"><b>16:22</b></a></span></td><td><span>The spirits - And this is no empty title here, but very emphatical. Thou art the maker of spirits, destroy not thy own workmanship!O thou who art the preserver of men, and of their spirits, the Lord of spirits,  <a href="/job/12-10.html">Job 12:10</a> , who as thou mayst justly destroy this people, so thou canst preserve whom thou pleasest: the father of spirits, the souls.Deal mercifully with thy own children: the searcher of spirits, thou canst distinguish between those who have maliciously railed this tumult, and those whose ignorance and simple credulity hath made them a prey to crafty seducers. Of all flesh - Of all mankind: the word flesh is often put for men. One man - Korah, the ringleader of this sedition.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu16_24"><b>16:24</b></a></span></td><td><span>The congregation - Whom for your sakes I will spare upon the condition following.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu16_25"><b>16:25</b></a></span></td><td><span>Unto Dathan - Because they refused to come to him. The elders - The seventy rulers, whom he carried with him for the greater solemnity of the action, and to encourage them in their work, notwithstanding the obstinate and untractable nature of the people they were to govern.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu16_27"><b>16:27</b></a></span></td><td><span>Stood in the door - An argument of their foolish confidence, obstinacy and impenitency, whereby they declared that they neither feared God, nor reverenced man.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu16_28"><b>16:28</b></a></span></td><td><span>All these works - As the bringing of the people out of Egypt; the conducting of them through the wilderness; the exercising authority among them; and giving laws to them concerning the priesthood.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu16_29"><b>16:29</b></a></span></td><td><span>The death of all men - By a natural death. The visitation of all men - By plague, or sword, or some usual judgment. The Lord hath not sent me - I am content that you take me for an imposter, falsely pretending to be sent of God.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu16_32"><b>16:32</b></a></span></td><td><span>All that appertained unto Korah - That is, all his family which were there, women, children, and servants; but his sons, who were spared,  <a href="/numbers/26-11.html">Numbers 26:11</a> ,58  <a href="/1-chronicles/6-22.html">1&nbsp;Chronicles 6:22</a> ,37, were absent either upon some serviceof the tabernacle, or upon some other occasion, God so ordering it by his providence either because they disliked their fathers act, or upon Moses's intercession for them. This expression may intimate, that Korah himself was not here, but that he continued with his two hundred and fifty men before the Lord, where they were waiting for God's decision of the controversy. Nor is it probable that their chief captain would desert them, and leave them standing there without an head, especially, when Aaron his great adversary, abode there still, and did not go with Moses to Dathan. And Korah may seem to have been consumed with those two hundred and fifty. And so much is intimated,  <a href="/numbers/16-40.html">Numbers 16:40</a> , that no stranger come near to offer incense before the Lord, that he be not as Korah, and as his company, that is, destroyed, as they were, by fire from the Lord. And when the Psalmist relates this history,  <a href="/psalms/106-17.html">Psalms 106:17</a> - 18, the earth's swallowing them up is confined toDathan and Abiram,  <a href="/psalms/106-17.html">Psalms 106:17</a> , and for all the rest of that conspiracy it is added,  <a href="/psalms/106-18.html">Psalms 106:18</a> .And a fire was kindled in their company, the flame burnt up the wicked.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu16_33"><b>16:33</b></a></span></td><td><span>Into the pit - Into the earth, which first opened itself to receive them, and then shut itself to destroy them.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu16_35"><b>16:35</b></a></span></td><td><span>From the Lord - From the cloud, wherein the glory of the Lord appeared.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu16_37"><b>16:37</b></a></span></td><td><span>To Eleazer - Rather than to Aaron, partly because the troublesome part of the work was more proper for him, and partly lest Aaron should be polluted by going amongst those dead carcasses; for it is probable this fire consumed them, as lightning sometimes doth, others, by taking away their lives, and leaving their bodies dead upon the place.Out of the burning - From among the dead bodies of those men who were burnt. Yonder - Far from the altar and sanctuary, into an unclean place, where the ashes were wont to be cast: by which God shews his rejection on of their services. They are hallowed - By God's appointment, because they were presented before the Lord by his express order,  <a href="/numbers/16-16.html">Numbers 16:16</a> ,17.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu16_38"><b>16:38</b></a></span></td><td><span>Their own souls - That is, their own lives: who were the authors of their own destruction. The altar - Of burnt - offerings, which was made of wood, but covered with brass before this time,  <a href="/exodus/27-1.html"> 27:1</a> ,2, to which this other covering was added for farther ornament, and security against the fire, continually burning upon it. A sign - A warning to all strangers to take heed of invading the priesthood.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu16_40"><b>16:40</b></a></span></td><td><span>To him - To Eleazer. These words belong to  <a href="/numbers/16-38.html">Numbers 16:38</a> , the meaning is, that Eleazer did as God bade him.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu16_41"><b>16:41</b></a></span></td><td><span>On the morrow - Prodigious wickedness and madness so soon to forget such a terrible instance of Divine vengeance! The people of the Lord - So they call those wicked wretches, and rebels against God! Tho' they were but newly saved from sharing in the same punishment, and the survivors were as brands plucked out of the burning, yet they fly in the face of Moses and Aaron, to whose intercession they owe their preservation.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu16_42"><b>16:42</b></a></span></td><td><span>They - Moses and Aaron, who in all their distresses made God their refuge.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu16_43"><b>16:43</b></a></span></td><td><span>Moses and Aaron came - To hear what God, who now appeared, would say to them.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu16_45"><b>16:45</b></a></span></td><td><span>They fell upon their faces - To beg mercy for the people; thus rendering Good for Evil.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu16_46"><b>16:46</b></a></span></td><td><span>Incense - Which was a sign of intercession, and was to be accompanied with it.
