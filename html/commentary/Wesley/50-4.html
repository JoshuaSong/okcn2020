		<span><span><center><b>The Book of Philippians<br>Chapter 4</b></center></span><span><b>Verses:</B></span><br><TABLE WIDTH="100%" CELLPADDING="4" CELLSPACING="0" BORDER="0"><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Php4_1"><b>4:1</b></a></span></td><td><span>So stand - As ye have done hitherto.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Php4_2"><b>4:2</b></a></span></td><td><span>I beseech - He repeats this twice, as if speaking to each face to face, and that with the utmost tenderness.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Php4_3"><b>4:3</b></a></span></td><td><span>And I entreat thee also, true yokefellow - St. Paul had many fellowlabourers, but not many yokefellows. In this number was Barnabas first, and then Silas, whom he probably addresses here; for Silas had been his yokefellow at the very place,  <a href="/acts/16-19.html">Acts 16:19</a> .Help those women who laboured together with me - Literally, who wrestled. The Greek word doth not imply preaching, or anything of that kind; but danger and toil endured for the sake of the gospel, which was also endured at the same time, probably at Philippi, by Clement and my other fellowlabourers - This is a different word from the former, and does properly imply fellowpreachers. Whose names, although not set down here, are in the book of life - As are those of all believers. An allusion to the wrestlers in the Olympic games, whose names were all enrolled in a book. Reader, is thy name there? Then walk circumspectly, lest the Lord blot thee out of his book!</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Php4_5"><b>4:5</b></a></span></td><td><span>Let your gentleness - Yieldingness, sweetness of temper, the result of joy in the Lord. Be known - By your whole behaviour. To all men - Good and bad, gentle and froward. Those of the roughest tempers are good natured to some, from natural sympathy and various motives; a Christian, to all. The Lord  - The judge, the rewarder, the avenger. Is at hand - Standeth atthe door.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Php4_6"><b>4:6</b></a></span></td><td><span>Be anxiously careful for nothing - If men are not gentle towards you, yet neither on this, nor any other account, be careful, but pray. Carefulness and prayer cannot stand together.In every thing - Great and small. Let your requests be made known  - They who by a preposterous shame or distrustful modesty, cover,stifle, or keep in their desires, as if they were either too small or too great, must be racked with care; from which they are entirely delivered, who pour them out with a free and filial confidence. To God - It is not always proper to disclose them to men. By supplication - Which is the enlarging upon and pressing our petition. With thanksgiving - The surest mark of a soul free from care, and of prayer joined with true resignation. This is always followed by peace. Peace and thanksgiving are both coupled together,  <a href="/colossians/3-15.html">Colossians 3:15</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Php4_7"><b>4:7</b></a></span></td><td><span>And the peace of God - That calm, heavenly repose, that tranquility of spirit, which God only can give. Which surpasseth all understanding - Which none can comprehend, save he that receiveth it. Shall keep - Shall guard, as a garrison does a city. Your hearts - Your affections. Your minds - Your understandings, and all the various workings of them; through the Spirit and power of Christ Jesus, in the knowledge and love of God. Without a guard set on these likewise, the purity and vigour of our affections cannot long be preserved.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Php4_8"><b>4:8</b></a></span></td><td><span>Finally - To sum up all. Whatsoever things are true  - Here are eight particulars placed in two fourfold rows; theformer containing their duty; the latter, the commendation of it. The first word in the former row answers the first in the latter; the second word, the second and so on. True - In speech.Honest - In action. Just - With regard to others. Pure - With regard to yourselves. Lovely - And what more lovely than truth?Of good report - As is honesty, even where it is not practised.If there be any virtue - And all virtues are contained in justice.If there be any praise - In those things which relate rather to ourselves than to our neighbour. Think on these things - That ye may both practise them yourselves, and recommend them to others.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Php4_9"><b>4:9</b></a></span></td><td><span>The things which ye have learned - As catechumens.And received - By continual instructions. And heard and seen  - In my life and conversation. These do, and the God of peaceshall be with you - Not only the peace of God, but God himself, the fountain of peace.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Php4_10"><b>4:10</b></a></span></td><td><span>I rejoiced greatly - St. Paul was no Stoic: he had strong passions, but all devoted to God. That your care of me hath flourished again - As a tree blossoms after the winter.Ye wanted opportunity - Either ye had not plenty yourselves, or you wanted a proper messenger.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Php4_11"><b>4:11</b></a></span></td><td><span>I have learned - From God. He only can teach this.In everything, therewith to be content - Joyfully and thankfully patient. Nothing less is Christian content. We may observe a beautiful gradation in the expressions, I have learned; I know; I am instructed; I can.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Php4_12"><b>4:12</b></a></span></td><td><span>I know how to be abased - Having scarce what is needful for my body. And to abound - Having wherewith to relieve others also. Presently after, the order of the words is inverted, to intimate his frequent transition from scarcity to plenty, and from plenty to scarcity. I am instructed - Literally, I am initiated in that mystery, unknown to all but Christians.Both to be full and to be hungry - For one day. Both to abound and to want - For a longer season.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Php4_13"><b>4:13</b></a></span></td><td><span>I can do all things - Even fulfil all the will of God.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Php4_15"><b>4:15</b></a></span></td><td><span>In the beginning of the gospel - When it was first preached at Philippi. In respect of giving - On your part.And receiving - On mine.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Php4_17"><b>4:17</b></a></span></td><td><span>Not that I desire - For my own sake, the very gift which I receive of you.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Php4_18"><b>4:18</b></a></span></td><td><span>An odour of a sweet smell - More pleasing to God than the sweetest perfumes to men.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Php4_19"><b>4:19</b></a></span></td><td><span>All your need - As ye have mine. According to his riches in glory - In his abundant, eternal glory.</table><!--pageCount=1-->
