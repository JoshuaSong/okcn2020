It seems, the several priests were to come from their cities to the temple by turns, before David's time; and it is certain they did so after it.But if any of them were not contented with this attendance upon God in his tabernacle, or temple, and desired more entirely and constantly to devote himself to God's service there, he was permitted so to do, because this was an eminent act of piety joined with self - denial, to part with those great conveniences which he enjoyed in the city of his possession.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="De18_8"><b>18:8</b></a></span></td><td><span>Like portions - With their brethren who were in actual ministration: as they share with them in the work, so shall they in the encouragements. Beside that which cometh - The reason of this law was, because he that waited on the altar, ought to live by the altar: and because it was fit he should keep his money, wherewith he might redeem what he sold, if afterwards he saw occasion for it. Mr. Henry adds a remarkable note here: especially considering he wrote threescore years ago. "A hearty, pious zeal to serve God and his church, tho' it may a little encroach upon a settled order, and there may be somewhat in it that looks irregular, yet ought to be gratified, and not discouraged. He that loves dearly to be employed in the service of the sanctuary: in God's name let him minster. He shall be as welcome to God as the Levites, whose course it was to minister, and should be so to them." </span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="De18_10"><b>18:10</b></a></span></td><td><span>Useth divination - Foretelleth things secret or to come, by unlawful arts and practices.
