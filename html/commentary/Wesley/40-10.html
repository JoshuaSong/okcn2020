		<span><span><center><b>The Book of Matthew<br>Chapter 10</b></center></span><span><b>Verses:</B></span><br><TABLE WIDTH="100%" CELLPADDING="4" CELLSPACING="0" BORDER="0"><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt10_1"><b>10:1</b></a></span></td><td><span>His twelve disciples - Hence it appears that he had already chosen out of his disciples, those whom he afterward termed apostles. The number seems to have relation to the twelve patriarchs, and the twelve tribes of Israel.  <a href="/mark/3-14.html"> 3:14</a> ; 6:7; Luke 6:13; 9:1.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt10_2"><b>10:2</b></a></span></td><td><span>The first, Simon - The first who was called to a constant attendance on Christ; although Andrew had seen him before Simon.  <a href="/acts/1-13.html">Acts 1:13</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt10_3"><b>10:3</b></a></span></td><td><span>Lebbeus - Commonly called Judas, the brother of James.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt10_4"><b>10:4</b></a></span></td><td><span>Iscariot - So called from Iscarioth, (the place of his birth,) a town of the tribe of Ephraim, near the city of Samaria.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt10_5"><b>10:5</b></a></span></td><td><span>These twelve Jesus sent forth - Herein exercising his supreme authority, as God over all. None but God can give men authority to preach his word. Go not - Their commission was thus confined now, because the calling of the Gentiles was deferred till after the more plentiful effusion of the Holy Ghost on the day of pentecost. Enter not - Not to preach; but they might to buy what they wanted,  <a href="/john/4-9.html"> 4:9</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt10_8"><b>10:8</b></a></span></td><td><span>Cast out devils - It is a great relief to the spirits of an infidel, sinking under a dread, that possibly the Gospel may be true, to find it observed by a learned brother, that the diseases therein ascribed to the operation of the devil have the very same symptoms with the natural diseases of lunacy, epilepsy, or convulsions; whence he readily and very willingly concludes, that the devil had no hand in them. But it were well to stop and consider a little. Suppose Godshould suffer an evil spirit to usurp the same power over a man's body, as the man himself has naturally; and suppose him actually to exercise that power; could we conclude the devil had no hand therein, because his body was bent in the very same manner wherein the man himself might have bent it naturally? And suppose God gives an evil spirit a greater power, to effectimmediately the organ of the nerves in the brain, by irritating them to produce violent motions, or so relaxing them that they can produce little or no motion; still the symptoms will be those of over tense nerves, as in madness, epilepsies, convulsions; or of relaxed nerves, as in paralytic cases. But could we conclude thence that the devil had no hand in them? Will any man affirm that God cannot or will not, on any occasion whatever, give such a power to an evil spirit? Or that effects, the like of which may be produced by natural causes, cannot possibly be produced by preternatural? If this be possible, then he who affirms it was so, in any particular case, cannot be justly charged with falsehood, merely for affirming the reality of a possible thing.Yet in this manner are the evangelists treated by those unhappy men, who above all things dread the truth of the Gospel, because, if it is true, they are of all men the most miserable. Freely ye have received - All things; in particular the power ofworking miracles; freely give - Exert that power wherever you come.  <a href="/mark/6-7.html"> 6:7</a> ; Luke 9:2.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt10_9"><b>10:9</b></a></span></td><td><span>Provide not - The stress seems to lie on this word: they might use what they had ready; but they might not stay a moment to provide any thing more, neither take any thought about it. Nor indeed were they to take any thing with them, more than was strictly necessary.<ol><li> Lest it should retard them.<li> Because they were to learn hereby to   trust to God in all future exigencies.</ol><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt10_10"><b>10:10</b></a></span></td><td><span>Neither scrip - That is, a wallet, or bag to hold provisions: Nor yet a staff - We read,  <a href="/mark/6-8.html"> 6:8</a> , Take nothing, save a staff only. He that hadone might take it; they that had none, might not provide any.For the workman is worthy of his maintenance - The word includes all that is mentioned in the 9th and 10th verses;  <a href="/matthew/10-9.html">Matthew 10:9</a> ,10 all that they were forbidden to provide for themselves, so far as it was needful for them.     <a href="/luke/10-7.html"> 10:7</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt10_11"><b>10:11</b></a></span></td><td><span>Inquire who is worthy - That you should abide with him: who is disposed to receive the Gospel.

The same will be the case, when we pray for them that are not worthy.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt10_14"><b>10:14</b></a></span></td><td><span>Shake off the dust from your feet - The Jews thought the land of Israel so peculiarly holy, that when they came home from any heathen country, they stopped at the borders and shook or wiped off the dust of it from their feet, that the holy land might not be polluted with it. Therefore the action here enjoined was a lively intimation, that those Jews who had rejected the Gospel were holy no longer, but were on a level with heathens and idolaters.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt10_16"><b>10:16</b></a></span></td><td><span>  <a href="/luke/10-3.html"> 10:3</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt10_17"><b>10:17</b></a></span></td><td><span>But think not that all your innocence and all your wisdom will screen you from persecution. They will scourge you in their synagogues - In these the Jews held their courts of judicature, about both civil and ecclesiastical affairs.  <a href="/matthew/24-9.html"> 24:9</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt10_19"><b>10:19</b></a></span></td><td><span>Take no thought - Neither at this time, on any sudden call,need we be careful how or what to answer.   <a href="/luke/12-11.html"> 12:11</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt10_21"><b>10:21</b></a></span></td><td><span>  <a href="/luke/21-16.html"> 21:16</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt10_22"><b>10:22</b></a></span></td><td><span>Of all men - That know not God.  <a href="/matthew/24-13.html">Matthew 24:13</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt10_23"><b>10:23</b></a></span></td><td><span>Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel - Make what haste ye will; till the Son of man be come - To destroy their temple and nation.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt10_24"><b>10:24</b></a></span></td><td><span>  <a href="/luke/6-30.html"> 6:30</a> ; John 15:20.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt10_25"><b>10:25</b></a></span></td><td><span>How much more - This cannot refer to the quantity of reproach and persecution: (for in this the servant cannot be above his lord:) but only to the certainty of it.   <a href="/matthew/12-24.html">Matthew 12:24</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt10_26"><b>10:26</b></a></span></td><td><span>Therefore fear them not - For ye have only the same usage with your Lord.

Therefore, What ye hear in the ear, publish on the house - top - Two customs of the Jews seem to be alluded to here. Their doctors used to whisper in the ear of their disciples what they were to pronounce aloud to others.And as their houses were low and flat roofed, they sometimes preached to the people from thence.     <a href="/luke/12-3.html"> 12:3</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt10_28"><b>10:28</b></a></span></td><td><span>And be not afraid - of any thing which ye may suffer for proclaiming it.

For this extends to the very smallest things. And if he has such care over the most inconsiderable creatures, how much more will he take care of you, (provided you confess him before men, before powerful enemies of the truth,) and that not only in this life, but in the other also?</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt10_30"><b>10:30</b></a></span></td><td><span>See note ...
