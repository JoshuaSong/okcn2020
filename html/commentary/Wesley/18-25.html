		<span><span><center><b>The Book of Job<br>Chapter 25</b></center></span><p><span><b>Chapter Overview:</B></span><blockquote><br>  Bildad teaches us, to think highly and honourably of God, and to think  meanly of ourselves, ver. 1 - 6.<br></BLOCKQUOTE><span><b>Verses:</B></span><br><TABLE WIDTH="100%" CELLPADDING="4" CELLSPACING="0" BORDER="0"><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job25_1"><b>25:1</b></a></span></td><td><span>Answered - Not to that which Job spake last, but to that which seemed most reprovable in all his discourses; his censure of God's proceedings with him, and his desire of disputing the matter with him. Perhaps Bildad and the rest now perceived that Job and they did not differ so much as they thought. They owned that the wicked might prosper for a while. And Job owned, they would be destroyed at the last.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job25_2"><b>25:2</b></a></span></td><td><span>Dominion - Sovereign power over all persons and things.Fear - Terror, that which justly makes him dreadful to all men, and especially to all that undertake to dispute with him. He - This clause, as well as the following verse, seems to be added to prove God's dominion and dreadfulness: he keepeth and ruleth all persons and things in heaven, in peace and harmony. The angels, though they be very numerous, all own his sovereignty, and acquiesce in his pleasure.The stars, tho' vast in their bulk, and various in their motions: exactly keep the order which God hath appointed them: and therefore it is great folly for thee to quarrel with the methods of God's dealings with thee.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job25_3"><b>25:3</b></a></span></td><td><span>Armies - Of the angels, and stars, and other creatures, all which are his hosts. Light - The light of the sun is communicated to all parts of the world. This is a faint resemblance, of the cognisance and care which God takes of the whole creation. All are under the light of his knowledge: all partake of the light of his goodness: his pleasure is to shew mercy: all the creatures live upon his bounty.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job25_4"><b>25:4</b></a></span></td><td><span>Man - The word signifies man that is miserable, which supposes him to be sinful; and shall such a creature quarrel with that dominion of God, to which the sinless, and happy, and glorious angels submit?God - Before God's tribunal, to which thou dost so boldly appeal.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job25_5"><b>25:5</b></a></span></td><td><span>Moon - The moon, tho' bright and glorious, if compared with the Divine Majesty, is without any lustre or glory. By naming the moon, and thence proceeding to the stars, the sun is also included.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job25_6"><b>25:6</b></a></span></td><td><span>Worm - Mean, and vile, and impotent; proceeding from corruption, and returning to it. The son - For miserable man in the last branch he here puts the son of any man, to shew that this is true even of the greatest and best of men. Let us then wonder at the condescension of God, in taking such worms into covenant and communion with himself!</table><span><!--pageCount=1-->
