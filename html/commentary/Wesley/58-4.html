This is proved,  <a href="/hebrews/4-3.html">Hebrews 4:3</a> - 11, thus: That psalm mentions a rest:yet it does not mean, <ol><li> God's rest from creating; for this was long before the   time of Moses. Therefore in his time another rest was   expected, of which they who then heard fell short Nor is it,<li> The rest which Israel obtained through Joshua;   for the Psalmist wrote after him. Therefore it is,<li> The eternal rest in heaven.</ol> As he said - Clearly showing that there is a farther rest thanthat which followed the finishing of the creation.Though the works were finished - Before: whence it is plain, God did not speak of resting from them.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Heb4_4"><b>4:4</b></a></span></td><td><span>For, long after he had rested from his works, he speaks again.  <a href="/genesis/2-2.html">Genesis 2:2</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Heb4_5"><b>4:5</b></a></span></td><td><span>In this psalm, of a rest yet to come.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Heb4_7"><b>4:7</b></a></span></td><td><span>After so long a time - It was above four hundred years from the time of Moses and Joshua to David.

Sharper than any two - edged sword - Penetrating the heart more than this does the body. Piercing - Quite through, and laying open. The soul and spirit, joints and marrow - The inmost recesses of the mind, which the apostle beautifully and strongly expresses by this heap of figurative words. And is a discerner - Not only of the thoughts, but also of the intentions.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Heb4_13"><b>4:13</b></a></span></td><td><span>In his sight - It is God whose word is thus "powerful:" it is God in whose sight every creature is manifest; and of this his word, working on the conscience, gives the fullest conviction. But all things are naked and opened - Plainly alluding to the sacrifices under the law which were first flayed, and then (as the Greek word literally means) cleft asunder through the neck and backbone; so that everything both without and within was exposed to open view.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Heb4_14"><b>4:14</b></a></span></td><td><span>Having therefore a great high priest - Great indeed, being the eternal Son of God, that is passed through the heavens  - As the Jewish high priest passed through the veil into the holy ofholies, carrying with him the blood of the sacrifices, on the yearly day of atonement; so our great high priest went once for all through the visible heavens, with the virtue of his own blood, into the immediate presence God.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Heb4_15"><b>4:15</b></a></span></td><td><span>He sympathizes with us even in our innocent infirmities, wants, weaknesses, miseries, dangers.
