Double - Not twice as much as her sins deserved, but abundantly enough to answer God's design in this chastisement, which was to humble and reform them, and to warn others by their example.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa40_3"><b>40:3</b></a></span></td><td><span>The voice - An abrupt speech. Methinks I hear a voice.Wilderness - This immediately relates to the deliverance of the Jews out of Babylon, and smoothing their passage from thence to Judea, which lay through a great wilderness; but principally to their redemption by the Messiah, whose coming was ushered in by the cry of John the baptist, in the wilderness. Prepare ye the way - You to whom this work belongs. He alludes to the custom of princes who send pioneers before them to prepare the way through which they are to pass. The meaning is, God shall by his spirit so dispose mens hearts, and by his providence so order the affairs of the world, as to make way for the accomplishment of his promise. This was eminently fulfilled, when Christ, who was, and is God, blessed for ever, came into the world in a visible manner.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa40_6"><b>40:6</b></a></span></td><td><span>Cry - God speaks unto his ministers. He - The prophet.All flesh - The prophet having foretold glorious things, confirms the certainty of them, by representing the vast difference between the nature, and word, and work of men and of God. All that men are or have, yea, their highest accomplishments, are but like the grass of the field, weak and vanishing, soon nipt and brought to nothing; but God's word is like himself, immutable and irresistible: and therefore as the mouth of the Lord, and not of man, hath spoken these things, so doubt not but they shall be fulfilled.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa40_9"><b>40:9</b></a></span></td><td><span> Zion - Zion or Jerusalem is the publisher, and thecities of Judah the hearers.
