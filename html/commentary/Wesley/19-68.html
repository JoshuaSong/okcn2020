		<span><span><center><b>The Book of Psalms<br>Chapter 68</b></center></span><br>&nbsp;<br>  The occasion of this psalm, seems to have been David's translation  of the ark to Zion, which was managed with great solemnity and  devotion. For the first words are the very same which Moses  appointed for such occasions,  <a href="/numbers/10-35.html">Numbers 10:35</a> ,  and the following verses pursue the same matter. Thence he falls into  a description of some of the glorious works of the God to whom this ark  belonged. But because David knew that both himself and the ark  were types of Christ, and that the church of Israel were a type of  the catholick church, consisting of Jews and Gentiles, and that  the legal administrations were types of those of the gospel, he  therefore by the spirit of prophecy, looked through the types, to the  great mysteries of Christ's resurrection and ascension, and of the  special privileges of the Christian church, and of the conversion of  the Gentiles, and intermixes passages, which immediately belong to  these things, although the words be so ordered, that they carry a  manifest allusion to the present actions, and may be applied to them,  in a secondary sense.<p><span><b>Chapter Overview:</B></span><blockquote><br>  He first prays against God's enemies, and for his people, ver. 1 - 3.<br>  Then praises God, for his greatness and goodness, ver. 4 - 6.<br>  For his wonderful works, ver. 7 - 14.<br>  For his special presence in his church, ver. 15 - 17.<br>  The ascension of Christ, and the salvation of his people, ver. 18 - 20.<br>  His victories over his enemies, and favours to his church, ver. 21 - 28.<br>  The accession of the Gentiles to the church, ver. 29 - 31.<br>  An awful acknowledgment of the glory and grace of God, ver. 32 - 35.<br>  To the chief musician, A psalm or song of David. </BLOCKQUOTE><span><b>Verses:</B></span><br><TABLE WIDTH="100%" CELLPADDING="4" CELLSPACING="0" BORDER="0"><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ps68_4"><b>68:4</b></a></span></td><td><span>Jah - Is an abbreviation of the name Jehovah, which the Heathens pronounced Jao.
