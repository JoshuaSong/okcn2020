God ordered them to demand it now at their departure, in jewels of silver, and jewels of gold; to prepare for which, God had now made the Egyptians as willing to part with them upon any terms, as before the Egyptians had made them willing to go upon any terms.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ex11_5"><b>11:5</b></a></span></td><td><span>The death of the first - born had been threatened,  <a href="/exodus/4-23.html"> 4:23</a> , but is last executed, and less judgments tried, which, if they had done the work, would have prevented this.

When Moses had thus delivered his message, he went out from Pharaoh in great anger, though he was the meekest of all the men of the earth.Probably he expected that the very threatening of the death of the first - born should have wrought upon Pharaoh to comply; especially he having complied so far already, and having seen how exactly all Moses's predictions were fulfilled. But it had not that effect; his proud heart would not yield, no not to save all the first - born of his kingdom.Moses hereupon was provoked to a holy indignation, being grieved, as our Saviour afterwards, for the hardness of his heart,  <a href="/mark/3-5.html"> 3:5</a> .</table><span><!--pageCount=1-->
