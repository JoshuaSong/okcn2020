Therefore these two words are used, he came both to mourn and to weep.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ge23_4"><b>23:4</b></a></span></td><td><span>I am a stranger and a sojourner with you - Therefore I am unprovided, and must become a suiter to you for a burying - place. This was one occasion which Abraham took to confess that he was a stranger and a pilgrim upon earth. The death of our relations should effectually mind us that we are not at home in this world. That I may bury my dead out of my sight - Death will make those unpleasant to our sight, who while they lived were the desire of our eyes. The countenance that was fresh and lively becomes pale and ghastly, and fit to be removed into the land of darkness.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ge23_6"><b>23:6</b></a></span></td><td><span>Thou art a prince of God among us - So the word is; not only great, but good.

Abraham was rich in silver and gold, andtherefore would not take advantage of Ephron's generosity.<li> In prudence. He would pay for it, lest Ephron, when this goodhumour was over, should upbraid him with it.</ol><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ge23_15"><b>23:15</b></a></span></td><td><span>The land is worth four hundred shekels of silver - About fifty pounds of our money, but what is that between me and thee? - He would rather oblige his friend than have so much money.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ge23_20"><b>23:20</b></a></span></td><td><span>A burying place - 'Tis worth noting, <ol><li> That a burying - place was the first spot of ground Abraham waspossessed of in Canaan.<li> That it was the only piece of land he was ever possessed of, tho' itwas all his own in reversion.
