For all the princes did not offer these things upon one and the same day, but on several days, as here it follows. And so this chapter comes in its proper place, and those things were done in the second month of the second year after the tabernacle and altar, and all other instruments thereof were anointed, as is here expressed; and after the Levites were separated to the service of the tabernacle, and appointed to their several works, which was done about a month after the tabernacle was erected, and after the numbering of the people,  <a href="/numbers/1-2.html">Numbers 1:2</a> - 49, when the princes here employed in the offerings were first constituted; and after the disposal of the tribes about the tabernacle, the order of which is here observed in the time of their offerings.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu7_2"><b>7:2</b></a></span></td><td><span>Offered - In the manner and days hereafter mentioned.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu7_3"><b>7:3</b></a></span></td><td><span>Waggons - For the more convenient and safe carriage of such things as were most cumbersome.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu7_5"><b>7:5</b></a></span></td><td><span>According to his service - More or fewer, as the nature of their service and of the things to be carried required.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu7_9"><b>7:9</b></a></span></td><td><span>Upon their shoulders - Because of the greater worth and holiness of the things which they carried.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu7_10"><b>7:10</b></a></span></td><td><span>The altar - Of burnt - offerings, and incense too, as appears from the matter of their offerings. Not for the first dedication of them, for it is apparent they were dedicated or consecrated before this time by Moses and Aaron: but for a farther dedication of them, these being the first offerings that were made for any particular persons or tribes.In the day - That is, about the time, as soon as it was anointed.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu7_11"><b>7:11</b></a></span></td><td><span>On his day - And in this offering they followed the order of their camp, and not of their birth.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu7_13"><b>7:13</b></a></span></td><td><span>Charger - A large dish or platter; to be employed about the altar of burnt - offering, or in the court; not in the sanctuary, for all its vessels were of gold.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu7_17"><b>7:17</b></a></span></td><td><span>Peace - offerings - Which are more numerous because the princes and priests, and some of the people made a feast before the Lord out of them.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu7_87"><b>7:87</b></a></span></td><td><span>Their meal - offering - Which was not mentioned before, because it was sufficiently understood from the law which required it.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu7_88"><b>7:88</b></a></span></td><td><span>After it was anointed - Which words are very conveniently added to explain in what sense he had so oft said, that this was done in the day when it was anointed, namely, not exactly, but in a latitude, a little after that it was anointed.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu7_89"><b>7:89</b></a></span></td><td><span>To speak with him - To consult God upon occasion.The mercy - seat - Which Moses standing without the veil could easily hear. And this seems to be added in this place, to shew that when men had done their part, God was not wanting in the performance of his part, and promise. God's speaking thus to Moses by an audible voice, as if he had been cloathed with a body, was an earnest of the incarnation of the Son of God, when in the fulness of time the Word should be made flesh, and speak in the language of the sons of men. That he who spake to Moses was the Eternal Word, was the belief of many of the ancients. For all God's communion with man is by his Son, who is the same yesterday, to - day and for ever.</table><span><!--pageCount=1-->
