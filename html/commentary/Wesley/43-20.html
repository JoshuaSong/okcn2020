Detain me not now. You will have other opportunities of conversing with me. For I am not ascended to my Father - I have not yet left the world. But go immediately to my brethren - Thus does he intimate in the strongest manner the forgiveness of their fault, even without ever mentioning it. These exquisite touches, which every where abound in the evangelical writings, show how perfectly Christ knew our frame.I ascend - He anticipates it in his thoughts, and so speaks of it as a thing already present. To my Father and your Father, to my God and your God - This uncommon expression shows that the only - begotten Son has all kind of fellowship with God. And a fellowship with God the Father, some way resembling his own, he bestows upon his brethren. Yet he does not say, Our God: for no creature can be raised to an equality with him: but my God and your God: intimating that the Father is his in a singular and incommunicable manner; and ours through him, in such a kind as a creature is capable of.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Joh20_19"><b>20:19</b></a></span></td><td><span>  <a href="/mark/16-14.html">Mark 16:14</a>   <a href="/john/20.html">joh 20:</a> ,  <a href="/luke/24-36.html">Luke 24:36</a> , .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Joh20_21"><b>20:21</b></a></span></td><td><span>Peace be unto you - This is the foundation of the mission of a true Gospel minister, peace in his own soul,  <a href="/2-corinthians/4-1.html"> 4:1</a> .As the Father hath sent me, so send I you - Christ was the apostle of the Father,  <a href="/hebrews/3-1.html">Hebrews 3:1</a> .

So far is plain. But here arises a difficulty. Are not the sins of one who truly repents, and unfeignedly believes in Christ, remitted, without sacerdotal absolution? And are not the sins of one who does not repent or believe, retained even with it? What then does this commission imply? Can it imply any more than, <ol><li> A power of declaring with authority the Christian terms   of pardon; whose sins are remitted and whose retained?   As in our daily form of absolution; and<li> A power of inflicting and remitting ecclesiastical   censures? That is, of excluding from, and   re - admitting into, a Christian congregation.</ol><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Joh20_26"><b>20:26</b></a></span></td><td><span>After eight days - On the next Sunday.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Joh20_28"><b>20:28</b></a></span></td><td><span>And Thomas said, My Lord and my God - The disciples had said, We have seen the Lord.
