To defend - Or, to save, which he did not by fighting against, and overthrowing their enemies, but by a prudent and pious government of them, whereby he kept them from sedition, oppression, and idolatry. In Shamir - Which was in the very midst of the land.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jud10_3"><b>10:3</b></a></span></td><td><span>A Gileadite - Of Gilead beyond Jordan.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jud10_4"><b>10:4</b></a></span></td><td><span>And he had thirty sons - They were itinerant judges, who rode from place to place, as their father's deputies to administer justice.Havoth - jair - These villages were called so before this time from another Jair, but the old name was revived and confirmed upon this occasion.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jud10_6"><b>10:6</b></a></span></td><td><span>Forsook the Lord - They grew worse and worse, and so ripened themselves for ruin.

And these eighteen years are not to be reckoned from Jair's death, because that would enlarge the time of the judges beyond the just bounds; but from the fourth year of Jair's reign: so that the greatest part of Jair's reign was contemporary with this affliction. The case of Jair and Samson seem to be much alike.For as it is said of Samson, that he judged Israel in the days of the tyranny of the Philistines, twenty years,  <a href="/judges/15-20.html">Judges 15:20</a> , by which it is evident, that his judicature, and their dominion, were contemporary; the like is to be conceived of Jair, that he began to judge Israel, and endeavoured to reform religion, and purge out all abuses; but being unable to effect this through the backwardness of the, people, God would not enable him to deliver the people, but gave them up to this sad oppression; so that Jair could only determine differences amongst the Israelites, but could not deliver them from their enemies.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jud10_10"><b>10:10</b></a></span></td><td><span>And served also - Because not contented to add idols to thee, we have preferred them before thee.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jud10_11"><b>10:11</b></a></span></td><td><span>The Lord said - Either by some prophet whom he raised and sent for this purpose: or by the high - priest, who was consulted in the case.From the Amorites - Both Sihon and Og, and their people, and other kings of the Amorites within Jordan.

But many things were done, which are not recorded. The Maonites - Either first, those who lived in, or near the wilderness of Maon, in the south of Judah,  <a href="default.aspx?reference=+23:25"> 23:25</a> <a href="/1-samuel/25-2.html">25:2</a>, whether Edomites or others. Or, secondly, the Mehunims, a people living near the Arabians, of whom, <a href="/2-chronicles/26-7.html">2&nbsp;Chronicles 26:7</a>.
