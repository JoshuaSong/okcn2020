He is also infinitely wise; and as none can work like him, so none can teach like him.Therefore do not presume to teach him how to govern the world.None teacheth with such authority and convincing evidence, with such condescension and compassion, with such power and efficacy as God doth, he teaches by the bible, and that is the best book; by his son, and he is the best master.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job36_24"><b>36:24</b></a></span></td><td><span>Remember - Call to mind this thy duty.

Hence Elihu proceeds to give some instances, in the works of nature and common providence. His general aim is to shew, <ol><li> That God is the first cause and supreme director of all the creatures;   whom therefore we ought with all humility and reverence to adore,<li> That it is presumption in us to prescribe to him in his special   providence toward men, when the operations even of common providence   about the meteors, are so mysterious and unaccountable.</ol><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job36_26"><b>36:26</b></a></span></td><td><span>Neither - He is eternal, as in his being, so in all his counsels; which therefore must be infinitely above the comprehension of short - lived men.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job36_27"><b>36:27</b></a></span></td><td><span>For - Having affirmed that God's works are incomprehensibly great and glorious, he now proves it from the most common works of nature and providence. And hence he leaves it to Job to consider how much more deep and inconceivable the secret counsels of God must be. Water - He orders matters so wisely, that the waters which are in the clouds, do not fall down at once in spouts, which would be pernicious to the earth and to mankind; but by degrees, and in drops. According - According to the proportion of vapours which the heat of the sun hath drawn up by the earth or sea. So it notes that great work of God by which the rain is first made of vapours, and afterwards resolved into vapours, or into the matter of succeeding vapours, by a constant rotation.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job36_29"><b>36:29</b></a></span></td><td><span>Understand - Whence it comes to pass, that a small cloud, no bigger than a man's hand, suddenly spreads over the whole heavens: how the clouds come to be suddenly gathered, and so condensed as to bring forth thunder and lightning. Noise - The thunder produced in the clouds, which are often called God's tent or tabernacle.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job36_30"><b>36:30</b></a></span></td><td><span>Light - The lightning; fitly God's light, because God only can light it. It - Upon the cloud, which is in a manner the candlestick in which God sets up this light. The sea - The lightning spreads far and wide over all the parts of the sea, and pierceth deep, reaching even to the bottom of it.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job36_31"><b>36:31</b></a></span></td><td><span>Judgeth - By thunder and lightning, and rain from the clouds, he executes his judgments against ungodly people. Meat - Giveth meat.By the same clouds, he provides plentiful showers dropping fatness on the earth.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job36_32"><b>36:32</b></a></span></td><td><span>Clouds - With thick and black clouds spread over the whole heavens. Light - The sun. The cloud - Which God interposes as a veil between the sun and earth.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job36_33"><b>36:33</b></a></span></td><td><span>The noise - The thunder gives notice of the approaching rain.Also - And as the thunder, so also the cattle sheweth, concerning the vapour, concerning the coming of the rain, by a strange instinct, seeking for shelter, when a change of weather is near.</table><span><!--pageCount=1-->
