Is near - So the scripture often speaks of things which are at a great distance, as if they were present or at hand,  <a href="/habakkuk/2-3.html">Habakkuk 2:3</a>   <a href="/isaiah/56.html">isa 56:</a> ,  <a href="/james/5-8.html"> 5:8</a> , 9 Rev 22:20.My righteousness - The same thing which he called salvation.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa56_2"><b>56:2</b></a></span></td><td><span>The man - Every man not only Jews but Gentiles, as it is explained in the following verses. The sabbath - The sabbath seems to be put here, as sacrifice is elsewhere, for the whole worship of God.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa56_3"><b>56:3</b></a></span></td><td><span>The stranger - The stranger, the Gentile, who by birth is a stranger to God, that hath turned from dumb idols to the living God.The eunuch - Who is here joined with the stranger, because he was forbidden to enter into the congregation of the Lord,  <a href="/deuteronomy/23-1.html"> 23:1</a> .Under these two instances he understands all those, who either by birth, or by any ceremonial pollution, were excluded from church privileges, and so he throws open the door to all true believers. A dry tree - A fruitless tree, accursed by God with the curse of barrenness.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa56_4"><b>56:4</b></a></span></td><td><span>Take hold - That stedfastly keep the conditions of my covenant.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa56_5"><b>56:5</b></a></span></td><td><span>In mine house - In my temple.
