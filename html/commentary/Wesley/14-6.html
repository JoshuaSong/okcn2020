And thus may we plead, with an eye to Christ, who is called David,  <a href="/hosea/3-5.html"> 3:5</a> .Lord, remember his merits, and accept of us, on the account of them.Remember the promises of the everlasting covenant, which are called the sure mercies of David,  <a href="/isaiah/55-3.html">Isaiah 55:3</a> . This must be all our desire, all our hope, all our prayer, and all our plea; for it is all our salvation.</table><span><!--pageCount=1-->
