		<span><span><center><b>The Book of Psalms<br>Chapter 69</b></center></span><p><span><b>Chapter Overview:</B></span><blockquote><br>  David complains of his troubles, and begs help from God, ver. 1 - 21.<br>  Foretells the judgments of God upon his persecutors, ver. 22 - 29.<br>  Concludes with praise and thanksgiving, ver. 30 - 36.<br>  In all this David was a type of Christ, and several passages of  this psalm are applied to him in the New Testament. So that, like the  22d psalm, it begins with the humiliation, and ends with the exaltation<br>  of Christ.  To the chief musician upon Shofhannim, a psalm of David. </BLOCKQUOTE><span><b>Verses:</B></span><br><TABLE WIDTH="100%" CELLPADDING="4" CELLSPACING="0" BORDER="0"><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ps69_1"><b>69:1</b></a></span></td><td><span>Waters - Tribulations.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ps69_4"><b>69:4</b></a></span></td><td><span>I restored - For peace sake.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ps69_5"><b>69:5</b></a></span></td><td><span>My sins - But O Lord, although I have been innocent to mine enemies, I am guilty of many sins and follies against thee.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ps69_6"><b>69:6</b></a></span></td><td><span>For my sake - Because of my sad disappointments.
