And the consequence is apparently just. For as all the faithful are the children of Abraham, and the Divine promise of being a God to him and his seed is entailed upon them, it implies their continued existence and happiness in a future state as much as Abraham's.And as the body is an essential part of man, it implies both his resurrection and theirs; and so overthrows the entire scheme of the Sadducean doctrine.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Lu20_40"><b>20:40</b></a></span></td><td><span>They durst not ask him any question - The Sadducees durst not.One of the scribes did, presently after.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Lu20_41"><b>20:41</b></a></span></td><td><span>  <a href="/matthew/22-41.html">Matthew 22:41</a> ; Mr 12:35.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Lu20_42"><b>20:42</b></a></span></td><td><span>  <a href="/psalms/110-1.html">Psalms 110:1</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Lu20_46"><b>20:46</b></a></span></td><td><span>  <a href="/matthew/23-5.html">Matthew 23:5</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Lu20_47"><b>20:47</b></a></span></td><td><span>  Matthew 23:14 .</table><span><!--pageCount=1-->
