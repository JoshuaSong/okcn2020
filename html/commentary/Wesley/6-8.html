The weak multitude indeed were not to go, because they might have hindered them in the following stratagem; and it was but fit that the military men who run the greatest hazards, should have the precedency in the spoils.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jos8_2"><b>8:2</b></a></span></td><td><span>To Ai - That is, the city and people of Ai. Unto Jericho and her king - That is, overcome and destroy them. This was enjoined to chastise their last insolence, and the triumphs and blasphemies which doubtless their success had produced: and to revive the dread and terror which had been impressed upon the Canaanites by Jericho's ruin, and had been much abated by the late success of Ai.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jos8_3"><b>8:3</b></a></span></td><td><span>To go up against Ai - That is, to consider about this expedition; not as if all the people of war did actually go up, which was both unnecessary and burdensome: but it seems to be resolved by Joshua and all the council of war, that the thirty thousand here following should be selected for the enterprize. Either, <p>   1, the thirty thousand now mentioned;or, 2. part of them; namely, such as were to lie in wait; and these were <p>    only five thousand men, as is expressed, ver.  <a href="/joshua/8-12.html">12</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jos8_4"><b>8:4</b></a></span></td><td><span>Them - The same party last spoken of, even the five thousand mentioned ver.  <a href="/joshua/8-12.html">12</a> , there are only two parties engaged in the taking of Ai, and but one ambush, as plainly appears by comparing ver.  <a href="/joshua/8-9.html">9</a> , with ver.  <a href="/joshua/8-12.html">12</a> , which speaks only of five thousand, who are justly supposed to be a part of those thirty thousand named, ver.  <a href="/joshua/8-3.html">3</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jos8_5"><b>8:5</b></a></span></td><td><span>That are - Or, that shall be: for at present he sent them away, ver.  <a href="/joshua/8-9.html">9</a> , but the next morning followed, and joined himself with them, ver.  <a href="/joshua/8-10.html">10</a> ,11.That we - I and the twenty five thousand with me.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jos8_9"><b>8:9</b></a></span></td><td><span>Sent them - The same party.

The elders of Israel - The chief magistrates and rulers of Israel under Joshua; and these, I suppose, went with Joshua, and with the army, to take care that the cattle and the spoil of the city, which was given by God to all Israel for a prey, ver.  <a href="/joshua/8-2.html">2</a> , 27, might be justly and equally divided between those that went to battle, and the rest of the people.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jos8_11"><b>8:11</b></a></span></td><td><span>That were with him - Namely, the thirty thousand mentioned, ver.  <a href="/joshua/8-3.html">3</a> , or the most of them.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jos8_12"><b>8:12</b></a></span></td><td><span>And he took - Or rather, but he had taken, namely, out of the said number of thirty thousand, for this is added by way of recapitulation and farther explication of what is said in general, ver.  <a href="/joshua/8-9.html">9</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jos8_13"><b>8:13</b></a></span></td><td><span>Joshua went - Namely, accompanied with a small part of the host now mentioned, that is, very early in the morning, when it was yet dark, as is said in a like case,  <a href="/john/20-1.html"> 20:1</a> , whence it is here called night, though it was early in the morning, as is said,  <a href="/joshua/8-10.html">Joshua 8:10</a> , for it seems most probable, that all was done in one night's space, and in this manner; Joshua sends away the ambush by night, ver.  <a href="/joshua/8-3.html">3</a> , and lodgeth that night with twenty - five thousand men, ver.  <a href="/joshua/8-9.html">9</a> , not far from the city. But not able or willing to sleep all night, he rises very early, ver.  <a href="/joshua/8-10.html">10</a> , and numbers his men, which by the help of the several officers was quietly done, and so immediately leads them towards Ai; and while it was yet duskish or night, he goes into the midst of the valley, ver.  <a href="/joshua/8-13.html">13</a> , and when the day dawns he is discovered by the king and people of Ai, who thereupon rose up early to fight with them, ver.  <a href="/joshua/8-14.html">14</a> .The valley - Which was near the city, thereby to allure them forth.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jos8_14"><b>8:14</b></a></span></td><td><span>His people - Namely, all his men of war, for the rest were left in Ai, ver.  <a href="/joshua/8-16.html">16</a> .At a time appointed - At a certain hour agreed upon between the king and people of Ai, and of Bethel too, who were their confederates in this enterprize, as it may seem from ver.  <a href="/joshua/8-17.html">17</a> . Possibly they might appoint the same hour of the day on which they had fought against Israel with good success, looking upon it as a lucky hour. Before the plain - That is, towards or in sight of that plain or valley in which the Israelites were, that so they might put themselves in battle - array.Against him - The former success having made him secure, as is usual in such cases; God also blinding his mind, and infatuating him, as he useth to do with those whom he intends to destroy.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jos8_15"><b>8:15</b></a></span></td><td><span>Made as if they were beaten - That is, fled from them, as it were for fear of a second blow.

Mount Ebal - God's altar was to be but in one place,  <a href="/deuteronomy/12-13.html"> 12:13</a> ,14, and this place was appointed to he mountEbal,  <a href="/deuteronomy/27-4.html"> 27:4</a> ,5, which also seems most proper, that in that place whence the curses of the law were denounced against sinners, there might also be the tokens and means of grace, and peace, and reconciliation with God, for the removing of the curses, and the procuring of God's blessing to sinners.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jos8_32"><b>8:32</b></a></span></td><td><span>Upon the stones - Not upon the stones of the altar, which were to be rough and unpolished, ver.  <a href="/joshua/8-31.html">31</a> , but upon other stones, smooth and plaistered, as is manifest from  <a href="/deuteronomy/27-2.html"> 27:2</a> .The law of Moses - Not certainly the whole five books of Moses, for what stones and time would have sufficed for this, but the most weighty parts of the law, and especially the law of the ten commandments.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jos8_33"><b>8:33</b></a></span></td><td><span>All Israel - That is, the whole congregation, old and young, male and female.
