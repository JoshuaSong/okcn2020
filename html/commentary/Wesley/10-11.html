When kings - Which is, when the ground is fit for the march of soldiers, and brings forth provision for man and beast. Tarried at Jerusalem - Had he been now in his post, at the head of his forces be had been out of the way of temptation.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Sa11_2"><b>11:2</b></a></span></td><td><span>Arose from off his bed - Where he had lain, and slept for some time. And the bed of sloth often proves the bed of lust.Washing herself - In a bath, which was in her garden. Probably from some ceremonial pollution.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Sa11_3"><b>11:3</b></a></span></td><td><span>He inquired - Instead of suppressing that desire which the sight of his eyes had kindled, he seeks rather to feed it; and first enquires who she was; that if she were unmarried, he might make her either his wife or his concubine.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Sa11_4"><b>11:4</b></a></span></td><td><span>Took her - From her own house into his palace, not by force, but by persuasion. Lay with her - See how all the way to sin is down hill!When men begin, they cannot soon stop themselves.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Sa11_8"><b>11:8</b></a></span></td><td><span>Go down - Not doubting but he would there converse with his wife, and so cover their sin and shame.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Sa11_9"><b>11:9</b></a></span></td><td><span>The servants - With the king's guard. This he did, by the secret direction of God's wise providence, who would bring David's sin to light.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Sa11_10"><b>11:10</b></a></span></td><td><span>Camest - Wearied with hard service and travel, nor did I expect or desire that thou shouldest now attend upon my person, or keep the watch.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Sa11_11"><b>11:11</b></a></span></td><td><span>The ark - This it seems, was now carried with them for their encouragement and direction, as was usual. Fields - In tents which are in the fields. His meaning is, now, when God's people are in a doubtful and dangerous condition, it becomes me to sympathize with them, and to abstain even from lawful delights.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Sa11_15"><b>11:15</b></a></span></td><td><span>He arose - So far is David from repenting, that he seeks to cover one sin with another. How are the beginnings of sin to be dreaded!For who knows where it will end? David hath sinned, therefore Uriah must die! That innocent, valiant, gallant man, who was ready to die for his prince's honour, must die by his prince's hand! See how fleshly lusts war against the soul, and what devastations they make in that war!How they blind the eyes, fear the conscience, harden the heart, and destroy all sense of honour and justice!</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Sa11_27"><b>11:27</b></a></span></td><td><span>The mourning - Which was seven days. Nor could the nature of the thing admit of longer delay, lest the too early birth of the child might discover David's sin. Bare a son - By which it appears, That David continued in the state of impenitency for divers months together; and this notwithstanding his frequent attendance upon God's ordinances. Which is an eminent instance of the corruption of man's nature, of the deceitfulness of sin, and of the tremendous judgment of God in punishing one sin, by delivering a man up to another.</table><span><!--pageCount=1-->
