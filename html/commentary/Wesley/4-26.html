Now they are numbered a third time, to demonstrate thefaithfulness of God, both in cutting all those off whom he had threatened to cut off,  <a href="/numbers/14-29.html">Numbers 14:29</a> , and in a stupendous increase of the people according to his promise, notwithstanding all their sins, and the sweeping judgments inflicted upon them; and to prepare the way for the equal division of the land, which they were now going to possess.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu26_7"><b>26:7</b></a></span></td><td><span>Families - The chief houses, which were subdivided into divers lesser families. Forty three thousand seven hundred and thirty - Whereas in their last numbering they were forty six thousand five hundred; for Korah's conspiracy, as well as other provocations of theirs, had cut off many of them.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu26_10"><b>26:10</b></a></span></td><td><span>With Korah - According to this translation Korah was not consumed by fire with his two hundred and fifty men, but swallowed up by the earth. But others rather think he was devoured by the fire, and render these words, and the things of Korah, or belonging to Korah, namely, his tent and goods, and family, children excepted, as here follows.A sign - God made them a monument or example, to warn others not to rebel against God, or magistracy, nor to usurp the priestly office.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu26_11"><b>26:11</b></a></span></td><td><span>Died not - God being pleased to spare them, because they disowned their father's fact, and separated themselves both from his tent and company.

From fifty nine thousand and three hundred it sunk to twenty two thousand and two hundred, little more than a third part of what it was. One whole family of that tribe, (Ohad mentioned  <a href="/exodus/6-15.html"> 6:15</a> ) was extinct in the wilderness. Some think most of the twenty four thousand, cut off by the plague for the iniquity of Peor, were of that tribe.For Zimri, a ring - leader in that iniquity, was a prince of that tribe.Simeon is not mentioned in Moses's blessing,  <a href="/deuteronomy/33-1.html">Deuteronomy 33:1</a> - 29.And the lot of that tribe in Canaan was inconsiderable, only a canton out of Judah's lot,  <a href="/joshua/19-9.html">Joshua 19:9</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu26_18"><b>26:18</b></a></span></td><td><span>Children of Gad - Fewer by above five thousand than there were in their last numbering.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu26_22"><b>26:22</b></a></span></td><td><span>The families of Judah - About two thousand more than they were,  <a href="/numbers/1-27.html">Numbers 1:27</a> , whereas the foregoing tribes were all diminished.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu26_34"><b>26:34</b></a></span></td><td><span>Fifty two thousand and seven hundred - Whereas they were but thirty two thousand and two hundred, in  <a href="/numbers/1-35.html">Numbers 1:35</a> .

Of names - Of persons, the share of each tribe was divided amongst the several families, to some more, to some less, according to the number of the persons of each family. And withal, if one of the portions proved too large or too little for the families and persons of that tribe, they might give part of their portion to another tribe, (as Simeon and Dan had part of Judah's share) or take away a part from the portion belonging to another tribe.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu26_55"><b>26:55</b></a></span></td><td><span>By lot - For the tribes, not for the several families; for the distribution of it to them was left to the rulers wisdom according to the rule now given.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu26_56"><b>26:56</b></a></span></td><td><span>Many and few - That share, which shall by lot fall to each tribe, shall be distributed to the several families and persons in such proportions as their numbers shall require.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu26_65"><b>26:65</b></a></span></td><td><span>Not left a man - Only of the Levites, who being not guilty of that sin did not partake of their judgment.</table><span><!--pageCount=1-->
