The lot did only determine the several parts to the several tribes, but did not precisely fix all the bounds of it; these might be either enlarged or diminished according to the greater or smaller number of the tribes.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jos14_4"><b>14:4</b></a></span></td><td><span>Were two tribes - That is, had the portion of two tribes, and therefore though Levi was excluded, there remained nine tribes and a half, to be provided for in Canaan.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jos14_5"><b>14:5</b></a></span></td><td><span>They - That is, the persons named, ver.  <a href="/joshua/14-5.html">5</a> , who acted in the name of the children of Israel, divided it, either now, or presently after.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jos14_6"><b>14:6</b></a></span></td><td><span>Then - When Joshua and the rest were consulting about the division of the land, though they did not yet actually divide it. The heads of that tribe who were willing thus to shew respect to him; and to testify their consent, that he should be provided for by himself, and that they would not take it as any reflection on the rest of the tribe.In Gilgal - Where the division of the land was designed and begun, though it was executed and finished at Shiloh. The Kenezite - Of the posterity of Kenaz.The Lord said - In general, the promise he made us of possessing this land; and for my part, that which is expressed here, ver.  <a href="/joshua/14-9.html">9</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jos14_7"><b>14:7</b></a></span></td><td><span>As it was in mine heart - I spake my opinion sincerely, without flattery and fear, when the other spies were biased by their own fears, and the dread of the people, to speak otherwise than in their consciences they believed.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jos14_8"><b>14:8</b></a></span></td><td><span>I wholly followed the Lord - Which self - commendation is justifiable, because it was necessary, as being the ground of his petition.Therefore it was not vain glory in him to speak it: no more than it is for those, who have God's spirit witnessing with their spirits, that they are the children of God, humbly and thankfully to tell others, for their encouragement, what God hath done for their souls.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jos14_10"><b>14:10</b></a></span></td><td><span>Forty - five years - Whereof thirty - eight years were spent in the wilderness, and seven since they came into Canaan. The longer we live the more sensible we should be, of God's goodness to us in keeping us alive! Of his care in prolonging our frail lives, his patience in prolonging our forfeited lives! And shall not the life thus kept by his providence, be devoted to his praise?</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jos14_11"><b>14:11</b></a></span></td><td><span>For war - Not only for counsel, but for action; for marching and fighting. And therefore this gift will not be cast away upon an unprofitable and unserviceable person. To go out, and to come in - To perform all the duties belonging to my place. Moses had said, that at eighty years old, even our strength is labour and sorrow. But Caleb was an exception to this rule: At eighty - five years old, his strength was still ease and joy. This he got by following the Lord fully.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jos14_12"><b>14:12</b></a></span></td><td><span>This mountain - That is, this mountainous country.

Hearing, the sense by which we get knowledge, is often put for knowing or understanding. If the Lord will be with me - A modest and pious expression, signifying both the absolute necessity of God's help, and his godly fear, lest God for his sins should deny his assistance to him; for although he was well assured in general, that God would crown his people with success in this war, yet he might doubt of his particular success in this or that enterprize. To drive them out - Out of their fastnesses where they yet remain, Caleb desires this difficult work as a testimony of his own faith, and as a motive to quicken his brethren to the like attempts.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jos14_13"><b>14:13</b></a></span></td><td><span>Blessed him - Prayed to God to bless and help him according to his own desire.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jos14_15"><b>14:15</b></a></span></td><td><span>A great man - In stature, and strength, and dignity, and authority, as being the progenitor of Anak, the father of those famous giants called Anakims.</table><span><!--pageCount=1-->
