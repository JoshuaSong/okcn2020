Hence we are taught to pray; our father which art in heaven. And the earth is my footstool - Or a place wherein I set my feet,  <a href="/matthew/5-35.html"> 5:35</a> .The house - Can there be an house built, that will contain me?My rest - Or where is the place wherein I can be said to rest in a proper sense?</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa66_2"><b>66:2</b></a></span></td><td><span>Have been - They were not only made by God, but kept in being by him. Look - Yet God will look with a favourable eye to him that hath a broken and contrite spirit, whose heart is subdued to the will of God, and who is poor, and low in his own eyes. Trembleth - Who trembleth when he hears God's threatening words, and hears every revelation of his will with reverence.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa66_3"><b>66:3</b></a></span></td><td><span>He that, &c. - Solomon,  <a href="/proverbs/15-8.html">Proverbs 15:8</a> , gives a full commentary on the whole verse; The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord. As if - From hence it is plain, that the prophet is not here reflecting upon idolatrous worship, but formal worship: upon those who in a formality worshipped the true God, and by acts which he had appointed. God by the prophet declares, that these mens services were no more acceptable to him than murder, idolatry, or the most horrid profanation of his name. Own ways - They live as they lust. Delight - They take pleasure in their sins.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa66_4"><b>66:4</b></a></span></td><td><span>Chuse - They have chosen to mock and delude me, I will chuse to suffer them to delude themselves; they have chosen to work wickedness, I will chuse the effect.

There is a noise of soldiers slaying, and of the poor people shrieking or crying out. Of the Lord - A voice of the Lord, not in thunder, but that rendereth recompence to his enemies. Thus he seems to express the destruction of the Jews by the Roman armies, as a thing at that time doing.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa66_7"><b>66:7</b></a></span></td><td><span>Before - The whole verse is expressive of a great and sudden salvation, which God would work for his church, like the delivery of a woman, and that of a man - child, before her travail, and without pain.Doubtless it refers to the coming of Christ, and the sudden propagation of the gospel.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa66_8"><b>66:8</b></a></span></td><td><span>For - As soon as the voice of the gospel put the church of the Jews into her travail, in Christ's and the Apostles time, it presently brought forth.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa66_9"><b>66:9</b></a></span></td><td><span>Shall I - I, that in the ordinary course of my providence use to give a birth to women, to whom I have given a power to conceive, shall I not give a birth to my people, whom by my promises I have made to conceive such expectations?

Her glory - Christ was the glory of the people of Israel, though he was also a light to the Gentiles.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa66_12"><b>66:12</b></a></span></td><td><span>Like a river - It is plain this prophecy relates to a farther conversion of the Jews than hath been yet seen. Ye - Ye Jews also.Her sides - The Gentiles were borne upon the sides of Jerusalem and dandled upon her knees, as first hearing from the Apostles (who were members of the Jewish church) the glad tidings of salvation.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa66_13"><b>66:13</b></a></span></td><td><span>As one whom, &c. - That is, in the most tender, and compassionate way.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa66_14"><b>66:14</b></a></span></td><td><span>Rejoice - The peace of the church and the propagation of the kingdom of Christ, is always the cause of an heart rejoicing to such as fear God, so that they flourish like an herb in the spring.The hand - The power, protection, and influence of God.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa66_15"><b>66:15</b></a></span></td><td><span>With fire - With terrible judgments, or with fire in a proper sense, understanding it of the fire with which enemies use to consume places brought under their power. Whirlwind - With a sudden sweeping judgment. Fury - That is, with fervour; for fury properly taken is not in God. Rebukes - They had contemned the rebukes of the law, now God will rebuke them with fire, and sword.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa66_16"><b>66:16</b></a></span></td><td><span>Plead - God at first pleads with sinners by words, but if he cannot so prevail, he will plead with them in a way by which he will overcome; by fire, pestilence and blood. All flesh - Thus he threatens to do with all the wicked Jews. The slain - Those whom God should cause to be slain.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa66_17"><b>66:17</b></a></span></td><td><span>Gardens - In which they worshipped idols.In the midst - Behind one of the trees, or one by one behind the trees.The abominations - All those beasts forbidden the Jews for meat.God will not only destroy gross idolaters, but all those who make no conscience of yielding obedience to the law of God in such things as seemed to them of a minute nature, and such as they easily might have obeyed.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa66_18"><b>66:18</b></a></span></td><td><span>Come - It shall come to pass that I will cast them off, and then l will gather all nations, &c.

Afar off - To all the quarters of the world. They shall - This was eminently made good after the destruction of Jerusalem, when the believers among the Jews, as well as the apostles went about publishing the gospel to all people, which was declaring the Lord's glory.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa66_20"><b>66:20</b></a></span></td><td><span>Your brethren - Those who are the children of Abraham, not considered as the father of the Jewish nation only, but considered as the father of many nations, and as the father of the faithful, and so are your brethren, shall be brought out of all nations for an offering to the Lord. Holy mountain - And they shall be brought into the church, which began at Jerusalem. As - And they shall come with as much joy and gladness, with as much sincerity and holiness, as the Godly Jews do when they bring their offerings in clean vessels.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa66_21"><b>66:21</b></a></span></td><td><span>For priests - God will find among the converted Gentiles those who though they are not of the tribe of Levi, yet shall do the true work of priests and Levites.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa66_22"><b>66:22</b></a></span></td><td><span>The new heavens - The new state of the church to be raised up under the Messiah.

But New Testament worship is expressed by Old Testament phrases. The Jews were only obliged to appear three times in a year at Jerusalem, but (saith the prophet) the gospel - church shall worship God from one sabbath to another.</table><!--pageCount=1-->
