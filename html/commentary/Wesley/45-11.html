		<span><span><center><b>The Book of Romans<br>Chapter 11</b></center></span><span><b>Verses:</B></span><br><TABLE WIDTH="100%" CELLPADDING="4" CELLSPACING="0" BORDER="0"><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ro11_1"><b>11:1</b></a></span></td><td><span>Hath God rejected his whole people - All Israel? In no wise.Now there is "a remnant" who believe,  <a href="/romans/11-5.html">Romans 11:5</a> ; and hereafter "all Israel will be saved,"  <a href="/romans/11-26.html">Romans 11:26</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ro11_2"><b>11:2</b></a></span></td><td><span>God hath not rejected that part of his people whom he foreknew - Speaking after the manner of men. For, in fact, knowing and foreknowing are the same thing with God, who knows or sees all things at once, from everlasting to everlasting.Know ye not - That in a parallel case, amidst a general apostasy, when Elijah thought the whole nation was fallen into idolatry, God "knew" there was "a remnant" of true worshippers.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ro11_3"><b>11:3</b></a></span></td><td><span>  <a href="/1-kings/19-10.html">1&nbsp;Kings 19:10</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ro11_4"><b>11:4</b></a></span></td><td><span>To Baal - Nor to the golden calves.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ro11_5"><b>11:5</b></a></span></td><td><span>According to the election of grace - According to that gracious purpose of God, "He that believeth shall be saved." </span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ro11_6"><b>11:6</b></a></span></td><td><span>And if by grace, then it is no more of works - Whether ceremonial or moral. Else grace is no longer grace - The very nature of grace is lost. And if it be of works, then it is no more grace: else work is no longer work - But the very nature of it is destroyed. There is something so absolutely inconsistent between the being justified by grace, and the being justified by works, that, if you suppose either, you of necessity exclude the other. For what is given to works is the payment of a debt; whereas grace implies an unmerited favour. So that the same benefit cannot, in the very nature of things, be derived from both.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ro11_7"><b>11:7</b></a></span></td><td><span>What then - What is the conclusion from the whole? It is this: that Israel in general hath not obtained justification; but those of them only who believe. And the rest were blinded  - By their own wilful prejudice.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ro11_8"><b>11:8</b></a></span></td><td><span>God hath at length withdrawn his Spirit, and so given them up to a spirit of slumber; which is fulfilled unto this day. >Isa 29:10</cite><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ro11_9"><b>11:9</b></a></span></td><td><span>And David saith - In that prophetic imprecation, which is applicable to them, as well as to Judas. A recompence - Of their preceding wickedness. So sin is punished by sin; and thus the gospel, which should have fed and strengthened their souls, is become a means of destroying them.  <a href="/psalms/69-22.html">Psalms 69:22</a> ,23</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ro11_11"><b>11:11</b></a></span></td><td><span>Have they stumbled so as to fall - Totally and finally? No But by their fall - Or slip: it is a very soft word in the original.Salvation is come to the gentiles - See an instance of this,  <a href="/acts/13-46.html">Acts 13:46</a> .To provoke them - The Jews themselves, to jealousy.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ro11_12"><b>11:12</b></a></span></td><td><span>The first part of this verse is treated of,  <a href="/romans/11-13.html">Romans 11:13</a> , &c; the latter, How much more their fulness, (that is, theirfull conversion,)  <a href="/romans/11-23.html">Romans 11:23</a> , &c.<p>  So many prophecies refer to this grand event, that it is<span><b>Chapter Overview:</B></span><blockquote><br>surprising any Christian can doubt of it. And these are greatly confirmed by the wonderful preservation of the Jews as a distinct people to this day. When it is accomplished, it will be so strong a demonstration, both of the Old and New Testament revelation, as will doubtless convince many thousand Deists, in countries nominally Christian; of whom there will, of course, be increasing multitudes among merely nominal Christians. And this will be a means of swiftly propagating the gospel among Mahometans and Pagans; who would probably have received it long ago, had they conversed only with real Christians.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top> <td align="right"><span><a name="Ro11_13"><b>11:13</b></a></span></td><td><span><br>I magnify my office - Far from being ashamed of ministering to the gentiles, I glory therein; the rather, as it may be a means of provoking my brethren to jealousy.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top> <td align="right"><span><a name="Ro11_14"><b>11:14</b></a></span></td><td><span><br>My flesh - My kinsmen.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top> <td align="right"><span><a name="Ro11_15"><b>11:15</b></a></span></td><td><span><br>Life from the dead - Overflowing life to the world, which was dead.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top> <td align="right"><span><a name="Ro11_16"><b>11:16</b></a></span></td><td><span><br>And this will surely come to pass. For if the first fruits be holy, so is the lump - The consecration of them was esteemed the consecration of all and so the conversion of a few Jews is an earnest of the conversion of all the rest. And if the root be holy - The patriarchs from whom they spring, surely God will at length make their descendants also holy.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top> <td align="right"><span><a name="Ro11_17"><b>11:17</b></a></span></td><td><span><br>Thou - O gentile. Being a wild olive tree - Had the graft been nobler than the stock, yet its dependance on it for life and nourishment would leave it no room to boast against it. How much less, when, contrary to what is practised among men, the wild olive tree is engrafted on the good!</span></td></tr><tr valign=top> <td align="right"><span><a name="Ro11_18"><b>11:18</b></a></span></td><td><span><br>Boast not against the branches - Do not they do this who despise the Jews? or deny their future conversion?</span></td></tr><tr valign=top> <td align="right"><span><a name="Ro11_20"><b>11:20</b></a></span></td><td><span><br>They were broken off for unbelief, and thou standest by faith - Both conditionally, not absolutely: if absolutely, there might have been room to boast. By faith - The free gift of God, which therefore ought to humble thee.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top> <td align="right"><span><a name="Ro11_21"><b>11:21</b></a></span></td><td><span><br>Be not highminded, but fear - We may observe, this fear is not opposed to trust, but to pride and security.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top> <td align="right"><span><a name="Ro11_22"><b>11:22</b></a></span></td><td><span><br>Else shalt thou - Also, who now "standest by faith," be both totally and finally cut off.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top> <td align="right"><span><a name="Ro11_24"><b>11:24</b></a></span></td><td><span><br>Contrary to nature - For according to nature, we graft the fruitful branch into the wild stock; but here the wild branch is grafted into the fruitful stock.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top> <td align="right"><span><a name="Ro11_25"><b>11:25</b></a></span></td><td><span><br>St. Paul calls any truth known but to a few, a mystery. Such had been the calling of the gentiles: such was now the conversion of the Jews. Lest ye should be wise in your own conceits - Puffed up with your present advantages; dreaming that ye are the only church; or that the church of Rome cannot fail. Hardness in part is happened to Israel, till - Israel therefore is neither totally nor finally rejected.The fullness of the gentiles be come in - Till there be a vast harvest amongst the heathens.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top> <td align="right"><span><a name="Ro11_26"><b>11:26</b></a></span></td><td><span><br>And so all Israel shall be saved - Being convinced by the coming of the gentiles. But there will be a still larger harvest among the gentiles, when all Israel is come in. The deliverer shall come - Yea, the deliverer is come; but not the full fruit of his coming. >Isa 59:20<br></cite><tr valign=top> <td align="right"><span><a name="Ro11_28"><b>11:28</b></a></span></td><td><span><br>They are now enemies - To the gospel, to God, and to themselves, which God permits.

First, God suffered the gentiles in the early age to revolt, and took the family of Abraham as a peculiar seed to himself. Afterwards he permitted them to fall through unbelief, and took in the believing gentiles. And he did even this to provoke the Jews to jealousy, and so bring them also in the end to faith. This was truly a mystery in the divine conduct, which the apostle adores with such holy astonishment.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top> <td align="right"><span><a name="Ro11_33"><b>11:33</b></a></span></td><td><span><br>O the depth of the riches, and wisdom, and knowledge of God  - In the ninth chapter, St. Paul had sailed but in a narrow sea: now he is in the ocean.The depth of the riches is described,  <a href="/romans/11-35.html">Romans 11:35</a> ;<br>the depth of wisdom,  <a href="/romans/11-34.html">Romans 11:34</a> ;<br>the depth of knowledge, in the latter part of this verse.Wisdom directs all things to the best end; knowledge sees that end.How unsearchable are his judgments - With regard to unbelievers.His ways - With regard to believers.His ways are more upon a level; His judgments "a great deep." But even his ways we cannot trace.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top> <td align="right"><span><a name="Ro11_34"><b>11:34</b></a></span></td><td><span><br>Who hath known the mind of the Lord - Before or any farther than he has revealed it.  <a href="/isaiah/40-13.html">Isaiah 40:13</a> .<br></span></td></tr><tr valign=top> <td align="right"><span><a name="Ro11_35"><b>11:35</b></a></span></td><td><span><br>Given to him - Either wisdom or power?</span></td></tr><tr valign=top> <td align="right"><span><a name="Ro11_36"><b>11:36</b></a></span></td><td><span><br>Of him - As the Creator.
