It being inconsistent with his wisdom to work them there, where it could not promote his great end; and with his goodness, seeing he well knew his countrymen would reject whatever evidence could be given them. And therefore to have given them more evidence, would only have increased their damnation.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mr6_6"><b>6:6</b></a></span></td><td><span>He marvelled - As man.

Sandals were pieces of strong leather or wood, tied under the sole of the foot by thongs, something resembling modern clogs. The shoes which they are in St. Matthew forbidden to take, were a kind of short boots, reaching a little above the mid - leg, which were then commonly used in journeys. Our Lord intended by this mission to initiate them into their apostolic work. And it was doubtless an encouragement to them all their life after, to recollect the care which God took of them, when they had left all they had, and went out quite unfurnished for such an expedition. In this view our Lord himself leads them to consider it, <cite>Luke 22:35: </cite> When I sent you forth without purse or scrip, lacked ye any thing?</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mr6_10"><b>6:10</b></a></span></td><td><span>  <a href="/matthew/10-11.html">Matthew 10:11</a> ; Lu 9:4.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mr6_12"><b>6:12</b></a></span></td><td><span>  <a href="/luke/9-6.html">Luke 9:6</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mr6_13"><b>6:13</b></a></span></td><td><span>They anointed with oil many that were sick - Which St. James gives as a general direction,  <a href="/james/5-14.html">James 5:14</a> ,15, adding those peremptory words, And the Lord shall heal him - He shall be restored to health: not by the natural efficacy of the oil, but by the supernatural blessing of God. And it seems this was the great standing means of healing, desperate diseases in the Christian Church, long before extreme unction was used or heard of, which bears scarce any resemblance to it; the former being used only as a means of health; the latter only when life is despaired of.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mr6_14"><b>6:14</b></a></span></td><td><span>  <a href="/matthew/14-1.html">Matthew 14:1</a> ; Lu 9:7.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mr6_15"><b>6:15</b></a></span></td><td><span>A prophet, as one of the prophets - Not inferior to one of the ancient prophets.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mr6_16"><b>6:16</b></a></span></td><td><span>But Herod hearing thereof - Of their various judgments concerning him, still said, It is John.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mr6_20"><b>6:20</b></a></span></td><td><span>And preserved him - Against all the malice and contrivances of Herodias.
