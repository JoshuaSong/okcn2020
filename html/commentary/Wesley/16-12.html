And whereas there were twenty four, and herebut twenty - two, and ver.  <a href="/nehemiah/12-12.html">12</a> , &c. only twenty, the reason of this difference may be, because two of the twenty four courses were extinct in Babylon, and two of the persons here named, ver.  <a href="/nehemiah/12-2.html">2</a> ,5, Hattush, and Maadiah, may be omitted in the account of the posterity of these, ver.  <a href="/nehemiah/12-12.html">12</a> , &c. because they had no posterity.Ezra - Either this was another Ezra, or if it were the same mentioned  <a href="/ezra/7-1.html">Ezra 7:1</a> , he lived to a great age; which may well be supposed,considering his great sobriety, and his great piety to which God promised long life, and withal the special providence of God continuing him so long in such a season, wherein the church of God did greatly need his help and counsel.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ne12_8"><b>12:8</b></a></span></td><td><span>Moreover, &c. - He was to see, that the psalms of thanksgiving were continually sung in the temple, in due time and manner.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ne12_10"><b>12:10</b></a></span></td><td><span>Jeshua - Here follows a catalogue of the Jewish high - priests; which was the more necessary, because their times were now to be measured, not by the years of their kings as formerly, but by their high - priests.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ne12_12"><b>12:12</b></a></span></td><td><span>Priests - As their fathers were priests in the days of Joshua, so in the days of Joiakim the son of Joshua, the sons of those persons executed the priesthood in their father's steads, some of their fathers probably being yet living, and many of them dead.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ne12_22"><b>12:22</b></a></span></td><td><span>Darius - Darius Noehus; and so this Jaddua might be father to him who was in the days of Darius Codomanus, and of Alexander the Great.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ne12_27"><b>12:27</b></a></span></td><td><span>The wall - Of the city itself, which is here dedicated to God, and to his honour and service, not only upon a general account, by which we ought to devote ourselves, and all that is ours, to God; but upon a more special ground, because this was a place which God himself had chosen, and sanctified by his temple and gracious presence, and therefore did of right belong to him; whence it is often called the holy city.And they restored it to God by this dedication, withal imploring the presence, and favour, and blessing of to this city by solemn prayers, and praises, and sacrifices, wherewith this dedication was accompanied.Places - To which they were now retired after that great and general assembly, chap. 8, 9, & 10.     <a href="/nehemiah/8-1.html">Nehemiah 8:1</a> &c.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ne12_30"><b>12:30</b></a></span></td><td><span>Purified themselves - They that would be instrumental to sanctify others, must sanctify themselves, and set themselves apart for God, with purity of mind and sincerity of intention.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ne12_31"><b>12:31</b></a></span></td><td><span>Princes - And half of the people with them.

And so did the Levites by the tithe of the tithes. Thus they all conscientiously paid their dues, and did not profane those things which God had sanctified, nor take them into their own common use. When what is contributed for the support of religion, is given with an eye to God, it is sanctified, and will cause the blessing to rest upon the house, and all that is therein.</table><span><!--pageCount=1-->
