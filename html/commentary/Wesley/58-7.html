		<span><span><center><b>The Book of Hebrews<br>Chapter 7</b></center></span><span><b>Verses:</B></span><br><TABLE WIDTH="100%" CELLPADDING="4" CELLSPACING="0" BORDER="0"><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Heb7_1"><b>7:1</b></a></span></td><td><span>The sum of this chapter is, Christ, as appears from his type, Melchisedec, who was greater than Abraham himself, from whom Levi descended, has a priesthood altogether excellent, new, firm, perpetual.  <a href="/genesis/14-18.html">Genesis 14:18</a> , &c.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Heb7_2"><b>7:2</b></a></span></td><td><span>Being first - According to the meaning of his own name. King of righteousness, then - According to the name of his city. King of peace - So in him, as in Christ, righteousness and peace were joined. And so they are in all that believe in him.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Heb7_3"><b>7:3</b></a></span></td><td><span>Without father, without mother, without pedigree  - Recorded, without any account of his descent from anyancestors of the priestly order. Having neither beginning of days, nor end of life - Mentioned by Moses. But being - In all these respects. Made like the Son of God - Who is really without father, as to his human nature; without mother, as to his divine; and in this also, without pedigree - Neither descended from any ancestors of the priestly order.Remaineth a priest continually - Nothing is recorded of the death or successor of Melchisedec. But Christ alone does really remain without death, and without successor.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Heb7_4"><b>7:4</b></a></span></td><td><span>The greatness of Melchisedec is described in all the preceding and following particulars. But the most manifest proof of it was, that Abraham gave him tithes as to a priest of God and a superior; though he was himself a patriarch, greater than a king, and a progenitor of many kings.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Heb7_5"><b>7:5</b></a></span></td><td><span>The sons of Levi take tithes of their brethren  - Sprung from Abraham as well as themselves. The Levitestherefore are greater than they; but the priests are greater than the Levites, the patriarch Abraham than the priests, and Melchisedec than him.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Heb7_6"><b>7:6</b></a></span></td><td><span>He who is not from them - The Levites Blessed - Another proof of his superiority. Even him that had the promises - That was so highly favoured of God.When St. Paul speaks of Christ, he says, "the promise;" promises refer to other blessings also.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Heb7_7"><b>7:7</b></a></span></td><td><span>The less is blessed - Authoritatively, of the greater.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Heb7_8"><b>7:8</b></a></span></td><td><span>And here - In the Levitical priesthood. But there - In the case of Melchisedec. He of whom it is testified that he liveth - Who is not spoken of as one that died for another to succeed him; but is represented only as living, no mention being made either of his birth or death.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Heb7_9"><b>7:9</b></a></span></td><td><span>And even Levi, who received tithes - Not in person, but in his successors, as it were, paid tithes - In the person of Abraham.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Heb7_11"><b>7:11</b></a></span></td><td><span>The apostle now demonstrates that the Levitical priesthood must yield to the priesthood of Christ, because Melchisedec, after whose order he is a priest, <ol> <li> Is opposed to Aaron,  <a href="/hebrews/7-11.html">Hebrews 7:11</a> - 14. <li> Hath no end of life,  <a href="/hebrews/7-15.html">Hebrews 7:15</a> - 19, </ol>but "remaineth a priest continually." If now perfection were by the Levitical priesthood - If this perfectly answered all God's designs and man's wants For under it the people received the law - Whence some might infer, that perfection was by that priesthood. What farther need was there, that another priest - Of a new order, should be set up? From this single consideration it is plain, that both the priesthood and the law, which were inseparably connected, were now to give way to a better priesthood and more excellent dispensation.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Heb7_12"><b>7:12</b></a></span></td><td><span>For - One of these cannot be changed without the other.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Heb7_13"><b>7:13</b></a></span></td><td><span>But the priesthood is manifestly changed from one order to another, and from one tribe to another. For he of whom these things are spoken - Namely, Jesus.Pertaineth to another tribe - That of Judah. Of which no man was suffered by the law to attend on, or minister at, the altar.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Heb7_14"><b>7:14</b></a></span></td><td><span>For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Judah - Whatever difficulties have arisen since, during so long a tract of time, it was then clear beyond dispute.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Heb7_15"><b>7:15</b></a></span></td><td><span>And it is still far more evident, that - Both the priesthood and the law are changed, because the priest now raised up is not only of another tribe, but of a quite different order.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Heb7_16"><b>7:16</b></a></span></td><td><span>Who is made - A priest. Not after the law of a carnal commandment - Not according to the Mosaic law, which consisted chiefly of commandments that were carnal, compared to the spirituality of the gospel. But after the power of an endless life - Which he has in himself, as the eternal Son of God.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Heb7_18"><b>7:18</b></a></span></td><td><span>For there is implied in this new and everlasting priesthood, and in the new dispensation connected therewith, a disannulling of the preceding commandment - An abrogation of the Mosaic law. For the weakness and unprofitableness thereof  - For its insufficiency either to justify or to sanctify.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Heb7_19"><b>7:19</b></a></span></td><td><span>For the law - Taken by itself, separate from the gospel. Made nothing perfect - Could not perfect its votaries, either in faith or love, in happiness or holiness.But the bringing in of a better hope - Of the gospel dispensation, which gives us a better ground of confidence, does. By which we draw nigh to God - Yea, so nigh as to be one spirit with him. And this is true perfection.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Heb7_20"><b>7:20</b></a></span></td><td><span>And - The greater solemnity wherewith he was made priest, farther proves the superior excellency of his priesthood.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Heb7_21"><b>7:21</b></a></span></td><td><span>The Lord sware and will not repent - Hence also it appears, that his is an unchangeable priesthood.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Heb7_22"><b>7:22</b></a></span></td><td><span>Of so much better a covenant - Unchangeable, eternal. Was Jesus made a surety - Or mediator. The word covenant frequently occurs in the remaining part of this epistle. The original word means either a covenant or a last will and testament. St. Paul takes it sometimes in the former, sometimes in the latter, sense; sometimes he includes both.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Heb7_23"><b>7:23</b></a></span></td><td><span>They were many priests - One after another.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Heb7_24"><b>7:24</b></a></span></td><td><span>He continueth for ever - In life and in his priesthood.That passeth not away - To any successor.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Heb7_25"><b>7:25</b></a></span></td><td><span>Wherefore he is able to save to the uttermost  - From all the guilt, power, root, and consequence of sin.Them who come - By faith. To God through him - As their priest. Seeing he ever liveth to make intercession - That is, he ever lives and intercedes. He died once; he intercedes perpetually.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Heb7_26"><b>7:26</b></a></span></td><td><span>For such an high priest suited us - Unholy, mischievous, defiled sinners: a blessed paradox!Holy - With respect to God. Harmless - With respect to men.Undefiled - With any sin in himself. Separated from sinners - As well as free from sin. And so he was when he left the world. And made - Even in his human nature.Higher than the heavens - And all their inhabitants.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Heb7_27"><b>7:27</b></a></span></td><td><span>Who needeth not to offer up sacrifices daily  - That is, on every yearly day of expiation; for he offeredonce for all: not for his own sins, for he then offered up himself "without spot to God." </span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Heb7_28"><b>7:28</b></a></span></td><td><span>The law maketh men high priests that have infirmity  - That are both weak, mortal, and sinful. But the oath whichwas since the law - Namely, in the time of David. Maketh the son, who is consecrated for ever - Who being now free, both from sin and death, from natural and moral infirmity, remaineth a priest for ever.</table><span><!--pageCount=1-->
