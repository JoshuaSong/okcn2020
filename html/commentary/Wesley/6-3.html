Through the host - The second time to give them more particular directions, as they had given them a general notice,  <a href="/joshua/1-10.html">Joshua 1:10</a> ,11.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jos3_3"><b>3:3</b></a></span></td><td><span>Commanded the people - In Joshua's name, and by his authority.Priests and Levites - Who were not only Levites, but priests also.For altho' the Levites were to carry the ark,  <a href="/numbers/4-1.html">Numbers 4:1</a> - 15, yet the priests might perform that office, and did so upon some solemn occasions.Go after it - Towards Jordan, to go over it in such a manner as I am about to describe. 'Till this time the ark went in the middle of the cloudy pillar, now it goes in the front. Probably the pillar of fire and cloud was still hovering over the ark.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jos3_4"><b>3:4</b></a></span></td><td><span>Two thousand cubits - A thousand yards, at which distance from it the Israelites seem to have been encamped in the wilderness. And because they generally went from their tents to the ark to worship God, especially on the sabbath - days; hence it hath been conceived, that a sabbath - day's journey reached only to two thousand cubits. But that may be doubted; for those who encamped nearest the ark, were at that distance from it, and came so far; but the rest were farther from it, and their sabbath - day's journey was considerably longer. Near unto it - Partly from the respect they should bear to the ark; but chiefly, that the ark marching so far before you into the river, and standing still there 'till you pass over, may give you the greater assurance of your safe passage. Ye have not passed this way heretofore - While we are here, we must expect unusual events, to pathways that we have not passed before: and much more when we go hence, when we pass thro' the valley of the shadow of death. But if we have the assurance of God's presence, what have we to fear?</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jos3_5"><b>3:5</b></a></span></td><td><span>And Joshua said - Or rather, had said, the day before their passage; for it follows, to - morrow. Sanctify yourselves - Both in soul and body, that you may be meet to receive such a favour, and with more reverence observe this great work, and fix it in your hearts.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jos3_6"><b>3:6</b></a></span></td><td><span>Take up - Namely, upon your shoulders; for so they were to carry it,  <a href="/numbers/7-9.html">Numbers 7:9</a> .Before the people - Not in the middle of them, as you used to do.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jos3_7"><b>3:7</b></a></span></td><td><span>Magnify thee - That is, to gain thee authority among them, as the person whom I have set in Moses's stead, and by whom I will conduct them to the possession of the promised land.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jos3_8"><b>3:8</b></a></span></td><td><span>The brink - Heb. to the extremity, so far as the river then spread itself, which was now more than ordinary,  <a href="/joshua/3-15.html">Joshua 3:15</a> .In Jordan - Within the waters of Jordan, in the first entrance into the river; Where they stood for a season, 'till the river was divided, and then they went into the midst of it, and there abode 'till all the people were passed over.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jos3_9"><b>3:9</b></a></span></td><td><span>Come hither - To the ark or tabernacle, the place of public assemblies. The Lord your God - Who is now about to give a proof that he is both the Lord, the omnipotent governor of heaven and earth, and all creatures; and your God, in covenant with you, having a tender care and affection for you.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jos3_10"><b>3:10</b></a></span></td><td><span>Ye shall know - By experience and sensible evidence.The living God - Not a dull, dead, senseless God, such as the gods of the nations are; but a God of life, and power, and activity to watch over you, and work for you. Among you - Is present with you to strengthen and help you.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jos3_12"><b>3:12</b></a></span></td><td><span>Twelve men - For the work described,  <a href="/joshua/4-2.html">Joshua 4:2</a> ,3.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jos3_13"><b>3:13</b></a></span></td><td><span>The ark of the Lord - That so it may appear this is the Lord's doing, and that in pursuance of his covenant made with Israel. Of all the earth - The Lord of all this globe of earth and water, who therefore can dispose of this river and the adjoining land as he pleaseth.Cut off - The waters which now are united now shall be divided, and part shall flow down the channel towards the dead sea, and the other part that is nearer the spring of the river, and flows down from it, shall stand still.An heap - Being as it were congealed, as the Red - Sea was,  <a href="/exodus/15-8.html">Exodus 15:8</a> , and so kept from overflowing the country.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jos3_15"><b>3:15</b></a></span></td><td><span>All the time of harvest - This is meant not of wheat - harvest, but of the barley - harvest, as is manifest from their keeping the passover at their first entrance,  <a href="/joshua/5-10.html">Joshua 5:10</a> , which was kept on the fourteenth day of the first month, when they were to bring a sheaf of their first - fruits, which were of barley. So that this harvest in those hot countries fell very early in the spring, when rivers used to swell most; partly because of the rains which have fallen all the winter, partly because of the snows which melt and come into the rivers. And this time God chose that the miracle might be more glorious, more amazing and terrible to the Canaanites; and that the Israelites might be entertained at their first entrance with plentiful and comfortable provisions.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jos3_16"><b>3:16</b></a></span></td><td><span>Adam - The city Adam being more obscure, is described by its nearness to a more known place, then eminent, but now unknown. The meaning is, that the waters were stopped in their course at that place, and so kept at a distance from the Israelites whilst they passed over.Against Jericho - Here God carried them over, because this part was, <ol><li> The strongest, as having in its neighbourhood an eminent city, a potentking, and a stout and war - like people.<li> The most pleasant and fruitful, and therefore more convenient both forthe refreshment of the Israelites after their long and tedious marches, and for their encouragement.</ol><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jos3_17"><b>3:17</b></a></span></td><td><span>Stood firm - That is, in one and the same place and posture; their feet neither moved by any waters moving in upon them, nor sinking into any mire, which one might think was at the bottom of the river. And this may be opposed to their standing on the bank of the water when they came to it, commanded,  <a href="/joshua/3-8.html">Joshua 3:8</a> , which was but for a while, 'till the waters were divided and gone away; and then they were to go farther, even into the midst of Jordan, where they are to stand constantly and fixedly, as this Hebrew word signifies, until all were passed over.The midst of Jordan - In the middle and deepest part of the river.</table><span><!--pageCount=1-->
