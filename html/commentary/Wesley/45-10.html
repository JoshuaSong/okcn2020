And seeking to establish their own righteousness  - Their own method of acceptance with God. Have not submittedto the righteousness of God - The way of justification which he hath fixed.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ro10_4"><b>10:4</b></a></span></td><td><span>For Christ is the end of the law - The scope and aim of it.It is the very design of the law, to bring men to believe in Christ for justification and salvation. And he alone gives that pardon and life which the law shows the want of, but cannot give. To every one - Whether Jew or gentile, treated of,  <a href="/romans/10-11.html">Romans 10:11</a> , &c.That believeth - Treated of,  <a href="/romans/10-5.html">Romans 10:5</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ro10_5"><b>10:5</b></a></span></td><td><span>For Moses describeth the only righteousness which is attainable by the law, when he saith, The man who doeth these things shall live by them - that is, he that perfectly keeps all these precepts in every point, he alone may claim life and salvation by them. But this way of justification is impossible to any who have ever transgressed any one law in any point. >Lev 18:5</cite><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ro10_6"><b>10:6</b></a></span></td><td><span>But the righteousness which is by faith - The method of becoming righteous by believing. Speaketh a very different language, and may be considered as expressing itself thus: (to accommodate to our present subject the words which Moses spake, touching the plainness of his law:) Say not in thy heart, Who shall ascend into heaven, as if it were to bring Christ down: or, Who shall descend into the grave, as if it were to bring him again from the dead - Do not imagine that these things are to be done now, in order to procure thy pardon and salvation.  <a href="/deuteronomy/30-14.html"> 30:14</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ro10_8"><b>10:8</b></a></span></td><td><span>But what saith he - Moses. Even these words, so remarkably applicable to the subject before us. All is done ready to thy hand. The word is nigh thee - Within thy reach; easy to be understood, remembered, practised. This is eminently true of the word of faith - The gospel. Which we preach - The sum of which is, If thy heart believe in Christ, and thy life confess him, thou shalt be saved.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ro10_9"><b>10:9</b></a></span></td><td><span>If thou confess with thy mouth - Even in time of persecution, when such a confession may send thee to the lions.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ro10_10"><b>10:10</b></a></span></td><td><span>For with the heart - Not the understanding only.Man believeth to righteousness - So as to obtain justification.And with the mouth confession is made - So as to obtain final salvation. Confession here implies the whole of outward, as believing does the root of all inward, religion.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ro10_11"><b>10:11</b></a></span></td><td><span>  <a href="/isaiah/28-16.html">Isaiah 28:16</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ro10_12"><b>10:12</b></a></span></td><td><span>The same Lord of all is rich - So that his blessings are never to be exhausted, nor is he ever constrained to hold his hand. The great truth proposed in <cite>Ro 10:11 is so repeated </cite> here, and in  <a href="/romans/10-13.html">Romans 10:13</a> , and farther confirmed,  <a href="/romans/10-14.html">Romans 10:14</a> ,15,as not only to imply, that "whosoever calleth upon him shall be saved;" but also that the will of God is, that all should savingly call upon him.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ro10_13"><b>10:13</b></a></span></td><td><span>  <a href="/joel/2-32.html"> 2:32</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ro10_15"><b>10:15</b></a></span></td><td><span>But how shall they preach, unless they be sent - Thus by a chain of reasoning, from God's will that the gentiles also should "call upon him," St. Paul infers that the apostles were sent by God to preach to the gentiles also. The feet - Their very footsteps; their coming.  <a href="/isaiah/52-7.html">Isaiah 52:7</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ro10_16"><b>10:16</b></a></span></td><td><span>  <a href="/isaiah/53-1.html">Isaiah 53:1</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ro10_17"><b>10:17</b></a></span></td><td><span>Faith, indeed, ordinarily cometh by hearing; even by hearing the word of God.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ro10_18"><b>10:18</b></a></span></td><td><span>But their unbelief was not owing to the want of hearing For they have heard.

I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are not a nation - As they followed gods that were not gods, so he accepted in their stead a nation that was not a nation; that is, a nation that was not in covenant with God. A foolish nation - Such are all which know not God. >Deut 32:21</cite><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ro10_20"><b>10:20</b></a></span></td><td><span>But Isaiah is very bold - And speaks plainly what Moses but intimated.  <a href="/isaiah/65-1.html">Isaiah 65:1</a> ,2.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ro10_21"><b>10:21</b></a></span></td><td><span>An unbelieving and gainsaying people - Just opposite to those who believed with their hearts, and made confession with their mouths.</table><span><!--pageCount=1-->
