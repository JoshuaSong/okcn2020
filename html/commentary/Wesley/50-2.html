		<span><span><center><b>The Book of Philippians<br>Chapter 2</b></center></span><span><b>Verses:</B></span><br><TABLE WIDTH="100%" CELLPADDING="4" CELLSPACING="0" BORDER="0"><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Php2_1"><b>2:1</b></a></span></td><td><span>If there be therefore any consolation - In the grace of Christ. If any comfort - In the love of God. If any fellowship of the Holy Ghost; if any bowels of mercies  - Resulting therefrom; any tender affection towards each other.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Php2_2"><b>2:2</b></a></span></td><td><span>Think the same thing - Seeing Christ is your common Head. Having the same love - To God, your common Father.Being of one soul - Animated with the same affections and tempers, as ye have all drank ill to one spirit. Of one mind - Tenderly rejoicing and grieving together.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Php2_3"><b>2:3</b></a></span></td><td><span>Do nothing through contention - Which is inconsistent with your thinking the same thing. Or vainglory - Desire of praise, which is directly opposite to the love of God. But esteem each the others better than themselves - (For every one knows more evil of himself than he can of another:) Which is a glorious fruit of the Spirit, and an admirable help to your continuing "of one soul." </span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Php2_4"><b>2:4</b></a></span></td><td><span>Aim not every one at his own things - Only. If so, ye have not bowels of mercies.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Php2_6"><b>2:6</b></a></span></td><td><span>Who being in the essential form - The incommunicable nature. Of God - From eternity, as he was afterward in the form of man; real God, as real man. Counted it no act of robbery  - That is the precise meaning of the words, - no invasion ofanother's prerogative, but his own strict and unquestionable right. To be equal with God - the word here translated equal, occurs in the adjective form five or six times in the New Testament,  <a href="/matthew/20-12.html">Matthew 20:12</a> ; Lu 6:34; Joh 5:18; Ac 11:17; Re 21:16.In all which places it expresses not a bare resemblance, but a real and proper equalitg. It here implies both the fulness and the supreme height of the Godhead; to which are opposed, he emptied and he humbled himself.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Php2_7"><b>2:7</b></a></span></td><td><span>Yet - He was so far from tenaciously insisting upon, that he willingly relinquished, his claim. He was content to forego the glories of the Creator, and to appear in the form of a creature; nay, to he made in the likeness of the fallen creatures; and not only to share the disgrace, but to suffer the punishment, due to the meanest and vilest among them all. He emptied himself - Of that divine fulness, which he received again at his exaltation. Though he remained full,  <a href="/john/1-14.html"> 1:14</a> , yet he appeared as if he had beenempty; for he veiled his fulness from the sight of men and angels.Yea, he not only veiled, but, in some sense, renounced, the glory which he had before the world began. Taking - And by that very act emptying himself. The form of a servant - The form, the likeness, the fashion, though not exactly the same, are yet nearly related to each other. The form expresses something absolute; the likeness refers to other things of the same kind; the fashion respects what appears to sight and sense. Being made in the likeness of men - A real man, like other men. Hereby he took the form of a servant.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Php2_8"><b>2:8</b></a></span></td><td><span>And being found in fashion as a man - A common man, without any peculiar excellence or comeliness. He humbled himself - To a still greater depth. Becoming obedient - To God, though equal with him. Even unto death - The greatest instance both of humiliation and obedience.Yea, the death of the cross - Inflicted on few but servants or slaves.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Php2_9"><b>2:9</b></a></span></td><td><span>Wherefore - Because of his voluntary humiliation and obedience. He humbled himself; but God hath exalted him - So recompensing his humiliation. And hath given him - So recompensing his emptying himself. A name which is above every name - Dignity and majesty superior to every creature.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Php2_10"><b>2:10</b></a></span></td><td><span>That every knee - That divine honour might be paid in every possible manner by every creature. Might bow - Either with love or trembling. Of those in heaven, earth, under the earth - That is, through the whole universe.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Php2_11"><b>2:11</b></a></span></td><td><span>And every tongue - Even of his enemies. Confess that Jesus Christ is Lord - Jehovah; not now "in the form of a servant," but enthroned in the glory of God the Father.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Php2_12"><b>2:12</b></a></span></td><td><span>Wherefore - Having proposed Christ's example, he exhorts them to secure the salvation which Christ has purchased. As ye have always - Hitherto. Obeyed - Both God, and me his minister.Now in my absence - When ye have not me to instruct, assist, and direct you. Work out your own salvation - Herein let every man aim at his own things. With fear and trembling - With the utmost care and diligence.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Php2_13"><b>2:13</b></a></span></td><td><span>For it is God - God alone, who is with you, though I am not. That worketh in you according to his good pleasure - Not for any merit of yours. Yet his influences are not to supersede, but to encourage, our own efforts. Work out your own salvation - Here is our duty. For it is God that worketh in you - Here is our encouragement. And O, what a glorious encouragement, to have the arm of Omnipotence stretched out for our support and our succour!</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Php2_14"><b>2:14</b></a></span></td><td><span>Do all things - Not only without contention,  <a href="/philippians/2-3.html">Philippians 2:3</a> , but evenwithout murmurings and disputings - Which are real, though smaller, hinderances of love.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Php2_15"><b>2:15</b></a></span></td><td><span>That ye may be blameless - Before men. And simple  - Before God, aiming at him alone. As the sons of God - The Godof love; acting up to your high character. Unrebukable in the midst of a crooked - Guileful, serpentine, and perverse generation  - Such as the bulk of mankind always were. Crooked - By a corruptnature, and yet more perverse by custom and practice.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Php2_17"><b>2:17</b></a></span></td><td><span>Here he begins to treat of the latter clause of  <a href="/philippians/1-22.html">Philippians 1:22</a> .Yea, and if I be offered - Literally, If I be poured out.Upon the sacrifice of your faith - The Philippians, as the other converted heathens, were a sacrifice to God through St. Paul's ministry,  <a href="/romans/15-16.html">Romans 15:16</a> . And as in sacrificing, wine was poured at the foot of the altar, so he was willing that his blood should be poured out. The expression well agrees with that kind of martyrdom by which he was afterwards offered up to God.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Php2_18"><b>2:18</b></a></span></td><td><span>Congratulate me - When I am offered up.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Php2_19"><b>2:19</b></a></span></td><td><span>When I know - Upon my return, that ye stand steadfast.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Php2_20"><b>2:20</b></a></span></td><td><span>I have none - Of those who are now with me.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Php2_21"><b>2:21</b></a></span></td><td><span>For all - But Timotheus. Seek their own - Ease, safety, pleasure, or profit. Amazing! In that golden age of the church, could St. Paul throughly approve of one only, among all the labourers that were with him?  <a href="/philippians/1-14.html">Philippians 1:14</a> ,17. And how many do we think can now approve themselves to God? Not the things of Jesus Christ - They who seek these alone, will sadly experience this. They will find few helpers likeminded with themselves, willing naked to follow a naked Master.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Php2_22"><b>2:22</b></a></span></td><td><span>As a son with his father - He uses an elegant peculiarity of phrase, speaking partly as of a son, partly as of a fellowlabourer.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Php2_25"><b>2:25</b></a></span></td><td><span>To send Epaphroditus - Back immediately. Your messenger - The Philippians had sent him to St. Paul with their liberal contribution.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Php2_26"><b>2:26</b></a></span></td><td><span>He was full of heaviness - Because he supposed you would be afflicted at hearing that he was sick.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Php2_27"><b>2:27</b></a></span></td><td><span>God had compassion on him - Restoring him to health.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Php2_28"><b>2:28</b></a></span></td><td><span>That I may be the less sorrowful - When I know you are rejoicing.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Php2_30"><b>2:30</b></a></span></td><td><span>To supply your deficiency of service - To do what you could not do in person.</table><span><!--pageCount=1-->
