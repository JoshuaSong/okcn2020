A vow of a Nazarite - Whereby they sequestered themselves from worldly employments and enjoyments, that they might entirely consecrate themselves to God's service, and this either for their whole lifetime, or for a less and limited space of time.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu6_3"><b>6:3</b></a></span></td><td><span>Nor eat grapes - Which was forbidden him for greater caution to keep him at the farther distance from wine.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu6_4"><b>6:4</b></a></span></td><td><span>All the days of his separation - Which were sometimes more, sometimes fewer, as he thought fit to appoint.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu6_5"><b>6:5</b></a></span></td><td><span>No razor - Nor scissors, or other instrument to cut off any part of his hair. This was appointed, partly as a sign of his mortification to worldly delights and outward beauty; partly as a testimony of that purity which hereby he professed, because the cutting off the hair was a sign of uncleanness, as appears from  <a href="/numbers/6-9.html">Numbers 6:9</a> , partly that by the length of his hair he might be constantly minded of his vow; and partly that he might reserve his hair entirely for God, to whom it was to be offered.Holy - That is, wholly consecrated to God and his service, whereby he shews that inward holiness was the great thing which God required and valued in these, and consequently in other rites and ceremonies.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu6_7"><b>6:7</b></a></span></td><td><span>His father - Wherein he was equal to the high - priest, being, in some sort, as eminent a type of Christ, and therefore justly required to prefer the service of God, to which he had so fully given himself, before the expressions of his affections to his dearest and nearest relations.The consecration - That is, the token of his consecration, namely, his long hair.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu6_9"><b>6:9</b></a></span></td><td><span>He shall shave his head - Because his whole body, and especially his hair was defiled by such an accident, which he ought to impute either to his own heedlessness, or to God's providence so ordering the matter, possibly for the punishment of his other sins, or for the quickening him to more purity and detestation of all dead works, whereby he would be defiled.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu6_11"><b>6:11</b></a></span></td><td><span>A sin - offering - Because such a pollution was, though not his sin, yet the chastisement of his sin.
