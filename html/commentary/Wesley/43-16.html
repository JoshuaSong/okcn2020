An abundant accomplishment of this we find in the Acts of the Apostles.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Joh16_9"><b>16:9</b></a></span></td><td><span>Of sin - Particularly of unbelief, which is the confluence of all sins, and binds them all down upon us.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Joh16_10"><b>16:10</b></a></span></td><td><span>Of righteousness, because I go to my Father - Which the Spirit will testify, though ye do not then see me. But I could not go to him if I were not righteous.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Joh16_11"><b>16:11</b></a></span></td><td><span>The prince of this world is judged - And in consequence thereof dethroned, deprived of the power he had so long usurped over men. Yet those who reject the deliverance offered them will remain slaves of Satan still.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Joh16_12"><b>16:12</b></a></span></td><td><span>I have yet many things to say - Concerning my passion, death, resurrection, and the consequences of it. These things we have, not in uncertain traditions, but in the Acts, the Epistles, and the Revelation. But ye cannot bear them now - Both because of your littleness of faith, and your immoderate sorrow.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Joh16_13"><b>16:13</b></a></span></td><td><span>When he is come - It is universally allowed that the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost dwell in all believers. And the internal agency of the Holy Ghost is generally admitted. That of the Father and the Son, as represented in this Gospel, deserves our deepest consideration.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Joh16_15"><b>16:15</b></a></span></td><td><span>All things that the Father hath are mine - Could any creature say this?</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Joh16_16"><b>16:16</b></a></span></td><td><span>A little while and ye shall not see me - When I am buried: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me - When I am risen: because I go to my Father - I die and rise again, in order to ascend to my Father.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Joh16_19"><b>16:19</b></a></span></td><td><span>Jesus said to them - Preventing their question.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Joh16_20"><b>16:20</b></a></span></td><td><span>Ye will weep and lament - When ye see me dead; but your sorrow will be turned into joy - When ye see me risen.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Joh16_22"><b>16:22</b></a></span></td><td><span>Ye now therefore have sorrow - This gives us no manner of authority to assert all believers must come into a state of darkness. They never need lose either their peace, or love, or the witness that they are the children of God. They never can lose these, but either through sin, or ignorance, or vehement temptation, or bodily disorder.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Joh16_23"><b>16:23</b></a></span></td><td><span>Ye shall not question me about any thing - Which you do not now understand. You will not need to inquire of me; for you will know all things clearly. Whatsoever ye shall ask - Knowledge, love, or any thing else, he will give it - Our Lord here gives us a charte blanche. Believer, write down what thou wilt. He had said,  <a href="/john/14-13.html"> 14:13</a> , I will do it, where the discourse was ofglorifying the Father through the Son. Here, speaking of the love of the Father to believers, he saith, He will give it.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Joh16_24"><b>16:24</b></a></span></td><td><span>Hitherto ye have asked nothing in my name - For they had asked him directly for all they wanted.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Joh16_26"><b>16:26</b></a></span></td><td><span>At that day ye shall ask - For true knowledge begets prayer.And I say not that I will pray - This in nowise implies that he will not: it means only, The Father himself now loves you, not only because of my intercession, but also because of the faith and love which he hath wrought in you.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Joh16_30"><b>16:30</b></a></span></td><td><span>Thou knowest all things - Even our hearts. Although no question is asked thee, yet thou answerest the thoughts of every one. By this we believe that thou camest forth from God - They, as it were, echo back the words which he had spoken in  <a href="/john/16-27.html"> 16:27</a> , implying, We believe in God; we believe also in thee.</table><span><!--pageCount=1-->
