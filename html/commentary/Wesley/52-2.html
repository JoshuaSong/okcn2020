A part is put for the whole. Is not, at any time, of deceit - We preach not a lie, but the truth of God. Nor of uncleanness - With any unholy or selfish view. This expression is not always appropriated to lust, although it is sometimes emphatically applied thereto.Nor in guile - But with great plainness of speech.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Th2_5"><b>2:5</b></a></span></td><td><span>Flattering words - This ye know. Nor a cloak of covetousness - Of this God is witness. He calls men to witness an open fact; God, the secret intentions of the heart. In a point of a mixed nature,  <a href="/1-thessalonians/2-10.html">1&nbsp;Thessalonians 2:10</a> , he appeals both to God and man.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Th2_6"><b>2:6</b></a></span></td><td><span>Nor from others - Who would have honoured us more, if we had been burdensome - That is, taken state upon ourselves.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Th2_7"><b>2:7</b></a></span></td><td><span>But we were gentle - Mild, tender. In the midst of you - Like a hen surrounded with her young. Even as a nurse cherisheth her own children - The offspring of her own womb.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Th2_8"><b>2:8</b></a></span></td><td><span>To impart our own souls - To lay down our lives for your sake.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Th2_10"><b>2:10</b></a></span></td><td><span>Holily - In the things of God.

They please not God - Nor are they even careful to please him, notwithstanding their fair professions. And are contrary to all men - Are common enemies of mankind; not only by their continual seditions and insurrections, and by their utter contempt of all other nations; but in particular, by their endeavouring to hinder their hearing or receiving the gospel.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Th2_16"><b>2:16</b></a></span></td><td><span>To fill up - The measure of their sins always, as they have ever done. But the vengeance of God is come upon them  - Hath overtaken them unawares, whilst they were seeking todestroy others, and will speedily complete their destruction.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Th2_17"><b>2:17</b></a></span></td><td><span>In this verse we have a remarkable instance, not so much of the transient affections of holy grief, desire, or joy, as of that abiding tenderness, that loving temper, which is so apparent in all St. Paul's writings, towards those he styles his children in the faith. This is the more carefully to be observed, because the passions occasionally exercising themselves, and flowing like a torrent, in the apostle, are observable to every reader; whereas it requires a nicer attention to discern those calm standing tempers, that fixed posture of his soul, from whence the others only flow out, and which more peculiarly distinguish his character.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Th2_18"><b>2:18</b></a></span></td><td><span>Satan - By those persecuting Jews,  <a href="/acts/17-13.html">Acts 17:13</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Th2_19"><b>2:19</b></a></span></td><td><span>Ye also - As well as our other children.</table><span><!--pageCount=1-->
