Pen - With such a pen as writers use.Concerning - Concerning that thing which is signified by the name of the child, which is here mentioned by way of anticipation.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa8_3"><b>8:3</b></a></span></td><td><span>Prophetess - To his own wife, so called, because the wife of a prophet.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa8_4"><b>8:4</b></a></span></td><td><span>To cry - To speak and to know his parents; which is within the space of two years. And his agrees with the other prophecy, chap. <a href="/isaiah/7-16.html">7:16</a> .Before the child shall know to refuse the evil and chuse the good, which requires a longer time than to distinguish his parents, and suits well to Shear - Jashub, who, being born some years before, was capable of that farther degree of knowledge, as soon as this was capable of the lower degree.

Wings - Of his forces, or of the wings of his army, as they still are called. My land - Of the land of Judah, so called because the Messiah, who is called Immanuel, should be born there. And this is added emphatically for the consolation of God's people, to assure them, that notwithstanding this dreadful scourge, yet God would make a difference between Israel and Judah, and whereas Israel should not be a people, Judah should be restored, for the sake of the Messiah, to be the place of his birth and ministry.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa8_9"><b>8:9</b></a></span></td><td><span>Ye people - Syrians and Israelites.

A stone - An occasion of sin and ruin, at whom they will take offence and stumble, so as to fall and be broken. To both - To the two kingdoms, that of the ten tribes, and that of the two tribes.Jerusalem - Which are distinctly mentioned, as a wonderful thing, because Jerusalem was the seat of the temple, and of God's solemn worship, where all the means of knowledge and grace were in greatest plenty, where the thrones of civil and ecclesiastical judicature were established, where the most wise and learned doctors had their constant abode. And that such a place and people should reject Immanuel when he should appear, was so strange an occurrence, that the prediction of it was highly necessary, lest otherwise, when it came to pass, it should shake the faith of all who did believe on him; whereas now the accomplishment hereof was a notable confirmation of their faith.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa8_15"><b>8:15</b></a></span></td><td><span>Many - Not all; for there shall be a remnant, as was foretold, chap. <a href="/isaiah/4-2.html">4:2</a>   <a href="/isaiah/8.html">isa 8:</a> ,  <a href="/isaiah/6-13.html">6:13</a> , .Stumble - At that stone or rock, mentioned, ver. <a href="/isaiah/8-14.html">8:14</a> .This was accomplished at the coming of the Messiah, whom the Jews rejected to their own destruction.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa8_16"><b>8:16</b></a></span></td><td><span>The testimony - By the testimony and the law or doctrine, he understands one and the same thing, as he doth also, ver.  <a href="/isaiah/8-20.html">20</a> , the word of God, and especially that which is the main scope thereof, the doctrine of the Messiah, which, though now professed by all the Israelites, shall be disowned by the generality of them, when the Messiah shall come. Bind up and seal are to be understood prophetically, declare and prophesy, that it shall be bound up and sealed.Moreover, bind up and seal, design the same thing. Security and secrecy, signifying, that it should certainly be fulfilled, yet withal kept secret from the unbelieving Jews.

You - My children, whom the prophet arms against the common temptation. Mutter - That speak with a low voice, as these two words signify, which they affected to do, speaking rather inwardly in their bellies, than audibly with their mouths.Should not - This answer the prophet puts into their mouths, doth not every nation, in cases of difficulty, seek to their gods? Much more should we do so, that have the only true God for our God. For the living - That is, for living men to enquire of the living God, is proper and reasonable; but it is highly absurd for them to forsake him, and to seek dead idols, either to the images, or to the spirits of dead men, which are supposed to speak in them.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa8_20"><b>8:20</b></a></span></td><td><span>To the law - Let this dispute between you and them be determined by God's word, which is here and in many other places called the law, to signify their obligation to believe and obey it; and the testimony, because it is a witness between God and man, of God's will, and of man's duty. They - Your antagonists. No light - This proceeds from the darkness of their minds, they are blind, and cannot see.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa8_21"><b>8:21</b></a></span></td><td><span>It - Their own land.
