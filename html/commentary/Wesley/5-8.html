		<span><span><center><b>The Book of Deuteronomy<br>Chapter 8</b></center></span><p><span><b>Chapter Overview:</B></span><blockquote><br>  An exhortation to obedience,   in consideration of past and promised mercies, ver. 1 - 9.<br>  A caution not to forget God in prosperity, ver. 10 - 18.<br>  A threatening, in case of apostacy, ver. 19, 20.<br></BLOCKQUOTE><span><b>Verses:</B></span><br><TABLE WIDTH="100%" CELLPADDING="4" CELLSPACING="0" BORDER="0"><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="De8_1"><b>8:1</b></a></span></td><td><span>Live - Live comfortably and happily.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="De8_2"><b>8:2</b></a></span></td><td><span>All the way - All the events which befel three in the way, the miraculous protections, deliverances, provisions, instructions which God gave thee; and withal the frequent and severe punishments of thy disobedience. To know - That thou mightest discover to thyself and others that infidelity, inconstancy, hypocrisy, and perverseness, which lay hid in thy heart; the discovery whereof was of singular use both to them, and to the church of God in all succeeding ages. It is good for us likewise to remember all the ways both of God's providence and grace, by which he has led us hitherto through the wilderness, that we may trust him, and chearfully serve him.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="De8_3"><b>8:3</b></a></span></td><td><span>By every word - That is, by every or any thing which God appoints for this end, how unlikely so - ever it may seem to be for nourishment; seeing it is not the creature, but only God's command and blessing upon it, that makes it sufficient for the support of life.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="De8_5"><b>8:5</b></a></span></td><td><span>As a man chastiseth his son - That is, unwillingly, being constrained by necessity; moderately, in judgment remembering mercy; and for thy reformation not thy destruction.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="De8_7"><b>8:7</b></a></span></td><td><span>Depths - Deep wells or springs, or lakes, which were numerous and large.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="De8_9"><b>8:9</b></a></span></td><td><span>Whose stones are iron - Where are mines of iron in a manner as plentiful as stones, and upon which travellers must tread, as in other parts they do upon stones.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="De8_10"><b>8:10</b></a></span></td><td><span>Bless the Lord - Solemnly praise him for thy food; which is a debt both of gratitude and justice, because it is from his providence and favour that thou receivest both thy food and refreshment and strength by it.The more unworthy and absurd is that too common profaneness of them, who, professing to believe a God, from whom all their comforts come, grudge to own him at their meals, either by desiring his blessing before them, or by offering due praise to God after them.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="De8_14"><b>8:14</b></a></span></td><td><span>Lifted up - As if thou didst receive and enjoy these things, either, by thy owns wisdom, and valour, and industry, or for thy own merit.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="De8_16"><b>8:16</b></a></span></td><td><span>That he might humble thee - By keeping thee in a constant dependence upon him for every day's food, and convincing thee what an impotent, helpless creature thou art, having nothing whereon to subsist, and being supported wholly by the alms of divine goodness from day to day.The mercies of God, if duly considered, are as powerful a mean to humble us as the greatest afflictions, because they increase our debts to God, and manifest our dependance upon him, and by making God great, they make us little in our own eyes. To do thee good - That is, that after he hath purged and prepared thee by afflictions, thou mayest receive and enjoy his blessings with less disadvantage, whilst by the remembrance of former afflictions. thou art made thankful for them, and more cautious not to abuse them.</table><span><!--pageCount=1-->
