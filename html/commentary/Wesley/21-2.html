Go to - O my soul! I will try whether I cannot make thee happy, by the enjoyment of sensual delights. Vanity - Is vain, and unable to make men happy.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ec2_2"><b>2:2</b></a></span></td><td><span>It is mad - This is an act of madness, more fit for fools who know nothing, than for wise men in this sinful, and dangerous, and deplorable state of mankind. What doth it - What good doth it? Or how can it make men happy? I challenge all the Epicures in the world to give me a solid answer.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ec2_3"><b>2:3</b></a></span></td><td><span>To wine - To gratify myself with delicious meats and drinks.Yet - Yet resolving to use my wisdom, that I might try whether I could not arrive at satisfaction, by mixing wine and wisdom together.To lay hold - To pursue sensual pleasures, which was my folly. 'Till - 'Till I might find out the true way to contentment andsatisfaction, during this mortal life.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ec2_6"><b>2:6</b></a></span></td><td><span>The wood - The nurseries of young trees, which for the multitude of them were like a wood or forest.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ec2_8"><b>2:8</b></a></span></td><td><span>Peculiar treasure - The greatest jewels and rarities of other kings, which they gave to me, either as a tribute, or by way of present.Of provinces - Which were imposed upon or presented by all the provinces of my dominions.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ec2_9"><b>2:9</b></a></span></td><td><span>Great - In riches, and power, and glory. My wisdom remained - As yet I was not wholly seduced from God.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ec2_10"><b>2:10</b></a></span></td><td><span>And - Whatsoever was grateful to my senses. Rejoiced - I had the comfort of all my labours, and was not hindered from the full enjoyment of them by sickness or war, or any other calamity.My portion - This present enjoyment of them, was all the benefit which I could expect from all my labours.

Done - As by others, so especially by myself. They can make no new discoveries as to this point. They can make no more of the pleasures of sense than I have done. Let me then try once more, whether wisdom can give happiness.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ec2_13"><b>2:13</b></a></span></td><td><span>I saw - I allowed thus much. Although wisdom is not sufficient to make men happy, yet it is of a far greater use than vain pleasures, or any other follies.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ec2_14"><b>2:14</b></a></span></td><td><span>Head - In their proper place. He hath the use of his eyes and reason, and foresees, and so avoids many dangers and mischiefs.Yet - Notwithstanding this excellency of wisdom above folly, at last they both come to one end. Both are subject to the same calamities, and to death itself, which takes away all difference between them.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ec2_15"><b>2:15</b></a></span></td><td><span>Why - What benefit have I by my wisdom?</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ec2_16"><b>2:16</b></a></span></td><td><span>For - Their memory, though it may flourish for a season, yet will in a little time be worn out; as we see it, most of the wise men of former ages, whose very names, together with all their monuments, are utterly lost.As the fool - He must die as certainly as the fool.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ec2_17"><b>2:17</b></a></span></td><td><span>Life - My life was a burden to me.
