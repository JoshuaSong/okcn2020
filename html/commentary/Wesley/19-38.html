To bring, &c. - Either, to God, that by this humble and mournful prayer, he might prevail with God, to remember and pity him; or, to himself, that by reviewing this psalm afterwards, he might call to mind his former danger and misery, and God's wonderful mercy in delivering him; and that others also might remember what God had done to him.</BLOCKQUOTE><span><b>Verses:</B></span><br><TABLE WIDTH="100%" CELLPADDING="4" CELLSPACING="0" BORDER="0"><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ps38_2"><b>38:2</b></a></span></td><td><span>Arrows - Thy judgments outward and inward.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ps38_3"><b>38:3</b></a></span></td><td><span>Sin - Which hath provoked thee to deal thus severely with me.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ps38_4"><b>38:4</b></a></span></td><td><span>Iniquities - Or, the punishment of mine iniquities, as this word is frequently used.
