		<span><span><center><b>The Book of James<br>Chapter 4</b></center></span><span><b>Verses:</B></span><br><TABLE WIDTH="100%" CELLPADDING="4" CELLSPACING="0" BORDER="0"><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jas4_1"><b>4:1</b></a></span></td><td><span>From whence come wars and fightings - Quarrels and wars among you, quite opposite to this peace? Is it not from your pleasures - Your desires of earthly pleasures. Which war - Against your souls. In your members - Here is the first seat of the war.Hence proceeds the war of man with man, king with king, nation with nation.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jas4_2"><b>4:2</b></a></span></td><td><span>Ye kill - In your heart, for "he that hateth his brother is a murderer." Ye fight and war - That is, furiously strive and contend. Ye ask not - And no marvel; for a man full of evil desire, of envy or hatred, cannot pray.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jas4_3"><b>4:3</b></a></span></td><td><span>But if ye do ask, ye receive not, because ye ask amiss - That is, from a wrong motive.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jas4_4"><b>4:4</b></a></span></td><td><span>Ye adulterers and adulteresses - Who have broken your faith with God, your rightful spouse. Know ye not that the friendship or love of the world - The desire of the flesh, the desire of the eye, and the pride of life, or courting the favour of worldly men, is enmity against God? Whosoever desireth to be a friend of the world - Whosoever seeks either the happiness or favour of it, does thereby constitute himself an enemy of God; and can he expect to obtain anything of him?</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jas4_5"><b>4:5</b></a></span></td><td><span>Do you think that the scripture saith in vain - Without good ground. St. James seems to refer to many, not any one particular scripture. The spirit of love that dwelleth in all believers lusteth against envy -   <a href="/galatians/5-17.html">Galatians 5:17</a> ; is directly opposite to all those unloving temperswhich necessarily flow from the friendship of the world.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jas4_6"><b>4:6</b></a></span></td><td><span>But he giveth greater grace - To all who shun those tempers. Therefore it - The scripture. Saith, God resisteth the proud - And pride is the great root of all unkind affections. >Prov 3:34</cite><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jas4_7"><b>4:7</b></a></span></td><td><span>Therefore by humbly submitting yourselves to God, resist the devil - The father of pride and envy.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jas4_8"><b>4:8</b></a></span></td><td><span>Then draw nigh to God in prayer, and he will draw nigh unto you, will hear you; which that nothing may hinder, cleanse your hands - Cease from doing evil. And purify your hearts - From all spiritual adultery. Be no more double minded, vainly endeavouring to serve both God and mammon.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jas4_9"><b>4:9</b></a></span></td><td><span>Be afflicted - For your past unfaithfulness to God.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jas4_11"><b>4:11</b></a></span></td><td><span>Speak not evil one of another - This is a grand hinderance of peace. O who is sufficiently aware of it!He that speaketh evil of another does in effect speak evil of the law, which so strongly prohibits it. Thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge - Of it; thou settest thyself above, and as it were condemnest, it.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jas4_12"><b>4:12</b></a></span></td><td><span>There is one lawgiver that is able - To execute the sentence he denounces. But who art thou - A poor, weak, dying worm.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jas4_13"><b>4:13</b></a></span></td><td><span>Come now, ye that say - As peremptorily as if your life were in your own hands.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jas4_15"><b>4:15</b></a></span></td><td><span>Instead of your saying - That is, whereas ye ought to say.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jas4_17"><b>4:17</b></a></span></td><td><span>Therefore to him that knoweth to do good and doeth it not - That knows what is right, and does not practise it.To him it is sin - This knowledge does not prevent, but increase, his condemnation.</table><span><!--pageCount=1-->
