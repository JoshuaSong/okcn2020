I will not spare - I will severely punish them.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Co13_4"><b>13:4</b></a></span></td><td><span>He was crucified through weakness - Through the impotence of human nature. We also are weak with him - We appear weak and despicable by partaking of the same sufferings for his sake. But we shall live with him - Being raised from the dead. By the power of God in you - By that divine energy which is now in every believer,  <a href="/2-corinthians/13-5.html"> 13:5</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Co13_5"><b>13:5</b></a></span></td><td><span>Prove yourselves - Whether ye are such as can, or such as cannot, bear the test - This is the proper meaning of the word which we translate, reprobates. Know ye not yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you - All Christian believers know this, by the witness and by the fruit of his Spirit. Some translate the words, Jesus Christ is among you; that is, in the church of Corinth; and understand them of the miraculous gifts and the power of Christ which attended the censures of the apostle.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Co13_6"><b>13:6</b></a></span></td><td><span>And I trust ye shall know - By proving yourselves, not by putting my authority to the proof.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Co13_7"><b>13:7</b></a></span></td><td><span>I pray God that ye may do no evil - To give me occasion of showing my apostolical power. I do not desire to appear approved - By miraculously punishing you. But that ye may do that which is good, though we should be as reprobates - Having no occasion to give that proof of our apostleship.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Co13_8"><b>13:8</b></a></span></td><td><span>For we can do nothing against the truth - Neither against that which is just and right, nor against those who walk according to the truth of the gospel.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Co13_9"><b>13:9</b></a></span></td><td><span>For we rejoice when we are weak - When we appear so, having no occasion to show our apostolic power. And this we wish, even your perfection - In the faith that worketh by love.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Co13_11"><b>13:11</b></a></span></td><td><span>Be perfect - Aspire to the highest degree of holiness.Be of good comfort - Filled with divine consolation. Be of one mind - Desire, labour, pray for it, to the utmost degree that is possible.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Co13_13"><b>13:13</b></a></span></td><td><span>The grace - Or favour. Of our Lord Jesus Christ - By which alone we can come to the Father. And the love of God  - Manifested to you, and abiding in you. And the communion - Orfellowship. Of the Holy Ghost - In all his gifts and graces.<p>  It is with great reason that this comprehensive and instructiveblessing is pronounced at the close of our solemn assemblies; and it is a very indecent thing to see so many quitting them, or getting into postures of remove, before this short sentence can be ended.<p>  How often have we heard this awful benediction pronounced! Letus study it more and more, that we may value it proportionably; that we may either deliver or receive it with a becoming reverence, with eyes and hearts lifted up to God, "who giveth the blessing out of Sion, and life for evermore." </table><!--pageCount=1-->
