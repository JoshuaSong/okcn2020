		<span><span><center><b>The Book of Psalms<br>Chapter 22</b></center></span><p><span><b>Chapter Overview:</B></span><blockquote><br>  It is confessed that David was a type of Christ, and that many  passages of the Psalms, though literally understood of David,  yet had a further and mystical reference to Christ. But there are  some other passages, which were directly, and immediately intended for,  and are properly to be understood of the Messiah; though withal there  may be some respect and allusion to the state of the penman himself.  And this seems to be the state of this psalm, which is understood of  the Messiah, by the Hebrew doctors themselves, and by Christ himself  and by his apostles. And there are many passages in it, which were  literally accomplished in him, and cannot be understood of any other.  In this psalm David speaks of the humiliation of Christ, ver. 1 - 21.<br>  Of the exaltation of Christ, ver. 22 - 31.<br>  To the chief musician upon Aijeleth Shahar, A psalm of David. <br>&nbsp;<br>Title of the psalm. Shahar - This was the title of some musical instrument, name, or song, which was usually sung in the morning.</BLOCKQUOTE><span><b>Verses:</B></span><br><TABLE WIDTH="100%" CELLPADDING="4" CELLSPACING="0" BORDER="0"><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ps22_1"><b>22:1</b></a></span></td><td><span>My God - Who art my friend and father, though now thou frownest upon me.

Thy name - that power and faithfulness and goodness, which thou hast manifested on my behalf.Congregations - The same whom he calls the congregation, and the seed of Jacob and Israel: which also does not so fitly agree to David, who never gives this title to any, but such as were near a - kin to him, as it does to Christ, who extends this name to all his disciples,  <a href="/matthew/12-48.html"> 12:48</a> ,49, and to whom this very text is applied,  <a href="/hebrews/2-11.html">Hebrews 2:11</a> ,12.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ps22_24"><b>22:24</b></a></span></td><td><span>Abhorred - He did not turn away his face from it, as men do from things which they abhor.

Remember - They shall remember their former wickedness with grief and shame, and fear; particularly in worshiping dead and impotent idols. They shall remember their great and manifold obligation to God, which they had quite forgotten, his patience in sparing them so long, in the midst of all their impieties, and in giving his son for them: they shall remember the gracious words and glorious works of Christ, what he did, and suffered for them; which possibly divers of them had been eye and ear - witnesses of.

Come - From Judea and Jerusalem (from whence the gospel was first to go forth) to the Gentile world, to the several parts whereof the apostles went upon this errand.
