For so you do, while you tell him that he must not afflict the godly, nor give the wicked prosperity.That he must invariably punish the wicked, and reward the righteous in this world. No: he will act as sovereign, and with great variety in his providential dispensations. High - The highest persons, on earth, he exactly knows them, and gives sentence concerning them, as he sees fit.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job21_25"><b>21:25</b></a></span></td><td><span>Another - Another wicked man.

So that no man can tell who is good, and who is bad by events which befall them in this life.And if one wicked man die in a palace, and another in a dungeon, they will meet in the congregation of the dead and damned; and the worm that dieth not, and the fire that is not quenched will be the same to both: which makes those differences inconsiderable, and not worth perplexing ourselves about.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job21_27"><b>21:27</b></a></span></td><td><span>Me - I know that your discourses, though they be of wicked, men in general, yet are particularly levelled at me.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job21_29"><b>21:29</b></a></span></td><td><span>Them - Any person that passes along the high - way, every one you meet with.
