But it was not true with regard to his human nature, for both his family and the place of his birth were plainly foretold.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Joh7_28"><b>7:28</b></a></span></td><td><span>Then cried Jesus - With a loud and earnest voice.

These words are, as it were, the text which is commented upon in this and the following chapter. Where I am - Christ's so frequently saying while on earth, where I am, when he spake of his being in heaven, intimates his perpetual presence there in his Divine nature: though his going thither was a future thing, with regard to his human nature.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Joh7_35"><b>7:35</b></a></span></td><td><span>Will he go to the dispersed among the Greeks - The Jews scattered abroad in heathen nations, Greece particularly.Or, Will he teach the Greeks? - The heathens themselves.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Joh7_37"><b>7:37</b></a></span></td><td><span>On the last, the great day of the feast - On this day there was the greatest concourse of people, and they were then wont to fetch water from the fountain of Siloam, which the priests poured out on the great altar, singing one to an other, With joy shall ye draw water from the wells of salvation. On this day likewise they commemorated God's miraculously giving water out of the rock, and offered up solemn prayers for seasonable rains.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Joh7_38"><b>7:38</b></a></span></td><td><span>He that believeth - This answers to let him come to me. And whosoever doth come to him by faith, his inmost soul shall be filled with living water, with abundance of peace, joy, and love, which shall likewise flow from him to others. As the Scripture hath said - Not expressly in any one particular place.But here is a general reference to all those scriptures which speak of the effusion of the Spirit by the Messiah, under the similitude of pouring out water.  <a href="/zechariah/14-8.html">Zechariah 14:8</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Joh7_39"><b>7:39</b></a></span></td><td><span>The Holy Ghost was not yet given - That is, those fruits of the Spirit were not yet given even to true believers, in that full measure.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Joh7_40"><b>7:40</b></a></span></td><td><span>The prophet - Whom we expect to be the forerunner of the Messiah.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Joh7_42"><b>7:42</b></a></span></td><td><span>From Bethlehem - And how could they forget that Jesus was born there?

Art thou also a Galilean? - One of his party? Out of Galilee ariseth no prophet  - They could not but know the contrary. They knew Jonah arose outof Gethhepher; and Nahum from another village in Galilee.Yea, and Thisbe, the town of Elijah, the Tishbite, was in Galilee also. They might likewise have known that Jesus was not born in Galilee, but at Bethlehem, even from the public register there, and from the genealogies of the family of David.
