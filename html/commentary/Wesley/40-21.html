The ancient Jewish doctors were wont to apply these prophecies to the Messiah. On an ass - The Prince of Peace did not take a horse, a warlike animal. But he will ride on that by and by,  <a href="/revelation/19-11.html">Revelation 19:11</a> . In the patriarchal ages, illustrious persons thought it no disgrace to make use of this animal: but it by no means appears, that this opinion prevailed, or this custom continued, till the reign of Tiberias. Was it a mean attitude wherein our Lord then appeared? Mean even to contempt! I grant it: I glory in it: it is for the comfort of my soul for the honour of his humility, and for the utter confusion of all worldly pomp and grandeur.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt21_7"><b>21:7</b></a></span></td><td><span>They set him thereon - That is, on the clothes.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt21_8"><b>21:8</b></a></span></td><td><span>A great multitude spread their garments in the way - A custom which was usual at the creation of a king,  <a href="/2-kings/9-13.html"> 9:13</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt21_9"><b>21:9</b></a></span></td><td><span>The multitudes cried, saying - Probably from a Divine impulse; for certainly most of them understood not the words they uttered.Hosanna - (Lord save us) was a solemn word in frequent use among the Jews. The meaning is, "We sing hosanna to the Son of David.Blessed is he, the Messiah, of the Lord. Save. Thou that art in the highest heavens." Our Lord restrained all public tokens of honour from the people till now, lest the envy of his enemies should interrupt his preaching before the time . But this reason now ceasing, he suffered their acclamations, that they might be a public testimony against their wickedness, who in four or five days after cried out, Crucify him, crucify him. The expressions recorded by the other evangelists are somewhat different from these: but all of them were undoubtedly used by some or others of the multitude.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt21_11"><b>21:11</b></a></span></td><td><span>This is Jesus from Nazareth - What a stumbling block was this!if he was of Nazareth, he could not be the Messiah. But they who earnestly desired to know the truth would not stumble thereat: for upon inquiry (which such would not fail to make) they would find, he was not of Nazareth, but Bethlehem.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt21_12"><b>21:12</b></a></span></td><td><span>He cast out all that sold and bought - Doves and oxen for sacrifice. He had cast them out three years before,  <a href="/john/2-14.html"> 2:14</a> ; bidding them not make that house a house of merchandise. Upon the repetition of the offence, he used sharper words. In the temple - That is, in the outer court of it, where the Gentiles used to worship. The money changers - The exchangers of foreign money into current coin, which those who came from distant parts might want to offer for the service of the temple.  <a href="/mark/11-11.html"> 11:11</a> ,15; Luke 19:45.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt21_13"><b>21:13</b></a></span></td><td><span>A den of thieves - A proverbial expression, for a harbour of wicked men.       <a href="/isaiah/56-7.html">Isaiah 56:7</a> ; Jer 7:11.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt21_16"><b>21:16</b></a></span></td><td><span>  <a href="/psalms/8-2.html"> 8:2</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt21_17"><b>21:17</b></a></span></td><td><span>  <a href="/mark/11-11.html"> 11:11</a> ,12.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt21_20"><b>21:20</b></a></span></td><td><span>The disciples seeing it - As they went by, the next day.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt21_21"><b>21:21</b></a></span></td><td><span>Jesus answering, said, If ye have faith - Whence we may learn, that one great end of our Lord in this miracle was to confirm and increase their faith: another was, to warn them against unfruitfulness.        <a href="/matthew/17-20.html">Matthew 17:20</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt21_23"><b>21:23</b></a></span></td><td><span>When he was come into the temple, the chief priests came  - Who thought he violated their right: and the elders of thepeople - Probably, members of the sanhedrim, to whom that title most properly belonged: which is the more probable, as they were the persons under whose cognizance the late action of Christ, in purging the temple, would naturally fall. These, with the chief priests, seem purposely to have appeared in a considerable company, to give the more weight to what they said, and if need were, to bear a united testimony against him. As he was teaching  - Which also they supposed he had no authority to do, beingneither priest, nor Levite, nor scribe. Some of the priests (though not as priests) and all the scribes were authorizedteachers. By what authority dost thou these things - Publicly teach the people! And drive out those who had our commission to traffic in the outer court?    <a href="/luke/20-1.html"> 20:1</a> ; Mark 11:27.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt21_24"><b>21:24</b></a></span></td><td><span>I will ask you one thing - Who have asked me many: The baptism, that is, the whole ministry of John, was it from heaven or from men? - By what authority did he act and teach? Did man or God give him that authority? Was it not God? But if so, the consequence was clear. For John testified that Jesus was the Christ.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt21_25"><b>21:25</b></a></span></td><td><span>Why did ye not believe him - Testifying this.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt21_27"><b>21:27</b></a></span></td><td><span>Neither tell I you - Not again, in express terms: he had often told them before, and they would not believe him.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt21_30"><b>21:30</b></a></span></td><td><span>He answered, I go, sir: but went not - Just so did the scribes and Pharisees: they professed the greatest readiness and zeal in the service of God: but it was bare profession, contradicted by all their actions.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt21_32"><b>21:32</b></a></span></td><td><span>John came in a way of righteousness - Walking in it, as well as teaching it. The publicans and harlots - The most notorious sinners were reformed, though at first they said, I will not.And ye seeing the amazing change which was wrought in them, though at first ye said, I go, sir, repented not afterward - Were no more convinced than before. O how is this scripture fulfilled at this day!</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt21_33"><b>21:33</b></a></span></td><td><span>A certain householder planted a vineyard - God planted the Church in Canaan; and hedged it round about - First with the law, then with his peculiar providence: and digged a wine press  - Perhaps it may mean Jerusalem: and built a tower - The temple:and went into a far country - That is, left the keepers of his vineyard, in some measure, to behave as they should see good.  <a href="/mark/12-1.html"> 12:1</a> ; Luke 20:9.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt21_34"><b>21:34</b></a></span></td><td><span>He sent his servants - His extraordinary messengers, the prophets: to the husbandmen - The ordinary preachers or ministers of the Jews.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt21_41"><b>21:41</b></a></span></td><td><span>They say - Perhaps some of the by - standers, not the chief priests or Pharisees; who, as St. Luke relates, said, God forbid,  <a href="/luke/20-16.html"> 20:16</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt21_42"><b>21:42</b></a></span></td><td><span>The builders - The scribes and priests, whose office it was to build up the Church. Is become the head of the corner - Or the chief corner stone: he is become the foundation of the Church, on which the whole building rests, and is the principal corner stone, for uniting the Gentiles to it, as the chief corner stone of a house supports and links its two sides together.  <a href="/psalms/118-22.html"> 118:22</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt21_43"><b>21:43</b></a></span></td><td><span>Therefore - Because ye reject this corner stone.

He is said to fall on this stone, who hears the Gospel and does not believe. But on whomsoever it shall fall - In vengeance, it will utterly destroy him.It will fall on every unbeliever, when Christ cometh in the clouds of heaven.      <a href="/luke/20-18.html"> 20:18</a> .</table><span><!--pageCount=1-->
