It is highly probable, that this is the creature here spoken of. Cord - Canst thou take him with a hook and a line, as anglers take ordinary fishes.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job41_2"><b>41:2</b></a></span></td><td><span>Thorn - Or, with an iron hook, or instrument as sharp as a thorn; wherewith thou usest to carry little fishes.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job41_3"><b>41:3</b></a></span></td><td><span>Supplications - Doth he dread thine anger or power? Or will he earnestly beg thy favour? It is a metaphor from men in distress, who use these means to them to whose power they are subject.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job41_7"><b>41:7</b></a></span></td><td><span>Fill - A whale's you may: but the skin of a crocodile is so hard that an iron or spear will not pierce it.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job41_8"><b>41:8</b></a></span></td><td><span>Lay - Seize upon him, if thou darest. Battle - But ere thou attempt it consider what thou art doing, and with whom, thou art going to fight. Do no more - Proceed no farther, draw back thy hand.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job41_9"><b>41:9</b></a></span></td><td><span>Hope - The hope of taking or conquering him.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job41_10"><b>41:10</b></a></span></td><td><span>Stand - To the battle.Me - To contend with me who created him?</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job41_11"><b>41:11</b></a></span></td><td><span>Prevented - Hath laid the first obligation upon me, for which I am indebted to him.

Face - The upper or outward part of his garment, or, the garment itself: the word face being often redundant. And by the garment is meant the skin which covers the whole body; who dare attempt to touch his very skin? Much less to give him a wound.His double bridle - His fast jaws, which have some resemblance to a double bridle: whence the Greeks call those parts of the face which reach to the jaws on both sides, the bridles.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job41_14"><b>41:14</b></a></span></td><td><span>Doors - His mouth.

So anger and fear are said by the poets to accompany the God of war.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job41_24"><b>41:24</b></a></span></td><td><span>Nether mill - stone - Which being to bear the weight of the upper, ought to be the harder and stronger of the two.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job41_25"><b>41:25</b></a></span></td><td><span>Raiseth - Upon the top of the waters.

The crocodile's skin, no sword, nor dart, nor musquet bullet can pierce.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job41_28"><b>41:28</b></a></span></td><td><span>Turned - Hurt him no more than a blow with a little stubble.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job41_30"><b>41:30</b></a></span></td><td><span>Stones - His skin is so impenetrable, that the sharpest stones or shells are as easy unto him as the mire.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job41_31"><b>41:31</b></a></span></td><td><span>Boil - To swell, and foam, and froth by his strong and vehement motion, as any liquor does when it is boiled in a pot, especially boiling ointment. The sea - The great river Nile, is called a sea, both in scripture, as  <a href="/isaiah/11-15.html">Isaiah 11:15</a> , and in other authors, as Euphrates is called the sea of Babylon,  <a href="/isaiah/21-1.html">Isaiah 21:1</a>   <a href="/job/41.html">job 41:</a> ,  <a href="/jeremiah/51-36.html">Jeremiah 51:36</a> , .Lakes also are most frequently called seas both in the Old and New Testament: and in such lakes the crocodiles are as well as in the Nile.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job41_32"><b>41:32</b></a></span></td><td><span>Shine - By the white froth or foam upon the waters.The same may be observed in the wake of a ship by night.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job41_34"><b>41:34</b></a></span></td><td><span>King, &c. - He can tame both the behemoth and leviathan, as strong and stout - hearted as they are. This discourse concerning them was brought in, to prove that it is God only, who can look upon proud men and abase them, bring them low, and hide them in the dust, he it is that beholdeth all high things, and wherein men dealt proudly, he is above them. He is king over all the children of pride, brutal or rational, and makes them either bend or break before him.</table><span><!--pageCount=1-->
