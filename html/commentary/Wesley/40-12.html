The temple was not yet built. The show bread - So they called the bread which the priest, who served that week, put every Sabbath day on the golden table that was in the holy place, before the Lord. The loaves were twelve in number, and represented the twelve tribes of Israel: when the new were brought, the stale were taken away, but were to be eaten by the priests only.  <a href="/1-samuel/21-6.html"> 21:6</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt12_5"><b>12:5</b></a></span></td><td><span>The priests in the temple profane the Sabbath - That is, do their ordinary work on this, as on a common day, cleansing all things, and preparing the sacrifices. A greater than the temple  - If therefore the Sabbath must give way to the temple, much moremust it give way to me.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt12_7"><b>12:7</b></a></span></td><td><span>I will have mercy and not sacrifice - That is, when they interfere with each other, I always prefer acts of mercy, before matters of positive institution: yea, before all ceremonial institutions whatever; because these being only means of religion, are suspended of course, if circumstances occur, wherein they clash with love, which is the end of it.  <a href="/matthew/9-13.html"> 9:13</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt12_8"><b>12:8</b></a></span></td><td><span>For the Son of man - Therefore they are guiltless, were it only on this account, that they act by my authority, and attend on me in my ministry, as the priests attended on God in the temple: is Lord even of the Sabbath - This certainly implies, that the Sabbath was an institution of great and distinguished importance; it may perhaps also refer to that signal act of authority which Christ afterward exerted over it, in changing it from the seventh to the first day of the week. If we suppose here is a transposition of the 7th and 8th verses, then the 8th verse is a proof of the 6th.  <a href="/matthew/12-7.html">Matthew 12:7</a> ,8,6.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt12_9"><b>12:9</b></a></span></td><td><span>  <a href="/mark/3-1.html"> 3:1</a> ; Luke 6:6.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt12_12"><b>12:12</b></a></span></td><td><span>It is lawful to do good on the Sabbath day - To save a beast, much more a man.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt12_18"><b>12:18</b></a></span></td><td><span>He shall show judgment to the heathens - That is, he shall publish the merciful Gospel to them also: the Hebrew word signifies either mercy or justice.     <a href="/isaiah/42-1.html">Isaiah 42:1</a> , &c.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt12_19"><b>12:19</b></a></span></td><td><span>He shall not strive, nor clamour; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets - That is, he shall not be contentious, noisy, or ostentatious: but gentle, quiet, and lowly. We may observe each word rises above the other, expressing a still higher degree of humility and gentleness.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt12_20"><b>12:20</b></a></span></td><td><span>A bruised reed - A convinced sinner: one that is bruised with the weight of sin: smoking flax - One that has the least good desire, the faintest spark of grace: till he send forth judgment unto victory - That is, till he make righteousness completely victorious over all its enemies.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt12_21"><b>12:21</b></a></span></td><td><span>In his name - That is, in him.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt12_22"><b>12:22</b></a></span></td><td><span>A demoniac, blind and dumb - Many undoubtedly supposed these defects to be merely natural.

Every one must be either with Christ or against him; either a loyal subject or a rebel. And there are none upon earth, who neither promote nor obstruct his kingdom. For he that does not gather souls to God, scatters them from him.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt12_31"><b>12:31</b></a></span></td><td><span>The blasphemy against the Spirit - How much stir has been made about this? How many sermons, yea, volumes, have been written concerning it? And yet there is nothing plainer in all the Bible.It is neither more nor less than the ascribing those miracles to the power of the devil, which Christ wrought by the power of the Holy Ghost.        <a href="/mark/3-28.html"> 3:28</a> ; Luke 12:10.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt12_32"><b>12:32</b></a></span></td><td><span>Whosoever speaketh against the Son of man - In any other respects: It shall be forgiven him - Upon his true repentance: But whosoever speaketh thus against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven, neither in this world nor in the world to come  - This was a proverbial expression among the Jews, for a thingthat would never be done. It here means farther, He shall not escape the punishment of it, either in this world, or in the world to come. The judgment of God shall overtake him, both here and hereafter.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt12_33"><b>12:33</b></a></span></td><td><span>Either make the tree good and its fruit good: or make the tree corrupt and its fruit corrupt - That is, you must allow, they are both good, or both bad. - For if the fruit is good, so is the tree; if the fruit is evil, so is the tree also. For the tree is known by its fruit - As if he had said, Ye may therefore know me by my fruits.

Accordingly they used to say a thing was done after three or seven days, if it was done on the third or seventh day, from that which was last mentioned. Instances of this may be seen,  <a href="/1-kings/20-29.html"> 20:29</a> ; and in many other places. And as the Hebrews had no word to express a natural day, they used night and day, or day and night for it. So that to say a thing happened after three days and three nights, was with them the very same, as to say, it happened after three days, or on the third day.
