Kingdom - In God's kingdom in alarge and general sense. And this, as well as the former phrase,singularly belongs to the Messiah, who was not only to be the king ofIsrael, but also of all nations. This is an intimation of that greatmystery which is more fully revealed in the new testament, namely, thatChrist, is the head, or king of all God's church, consisting of Jews andGentiles, and of all nations, and indeed of all creatures, all which isGod's kingdom, and by him given to his son our blessed Lord.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Ch17_16"><b>17:16</b></a></span></td><td><span>Who am I, &c. - We have here David's solemn address to God, in answer to his gracious message.
