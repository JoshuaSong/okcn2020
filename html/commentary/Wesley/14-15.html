Israel is here understood of the whole nation of Israel in former times, and especially in the times of the judges: for then many times they were in a great measure, without God and his law, and teaching priests, as plainly appears from the book of the Judges; they were brought to all the exigencies and calamities following; and they sometimes turned to the Lord, and he was found of them.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Ch15_5"><b>15:5</b></a></span></td><td><span>In those times - When Israel lived in the gross neglect of God and his law. No peace - Men could not go abroad about their private occasions without great danger; as it was in the days of Shamgar,  <a href="/judges/5-6.html">Judges 5:6</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Ch15_6"><b>15:6</b></a></span></td><td><span>And nation, &c. - One part of the people of Israel destroyed the other by civil wars.

And tho' no promise could lay any higher obligation upon them, than they were already under, yet it would help to increase their sense of the obligation, and to arm them against temptations. And by joining all together in this, they strengthened the hands of each other </span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Ch15_15"><b>15:15</b></a></span></td><td><span>Rejoiced at the oath - The times of renewing our covenant with God, should be times of rejoicing.
