		<span><span><center><b>The Book of Acts<br>Chapter 10</b></center></span><span><b>Verses:</B></span><br><TABLE WIDTH="100%" CELLPADDING="4" CELLSPACING="0" BORDER="0"><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ac10_1"><b>10:1</b></a></span></td><td><span>And there was a certain man - The first fruits of the Gentiles, in Cesarea - Where Philip had been before,  <a href="/acts/8-40.html">Acts 8:40</a> ; so that the doctrine of salvation by faith inJesus was not unknown there. Cesarea was the seat of the civil government, as Jerusalem was of the ecclesiastical. It is observable, that the Gospel made its way first through the metropolitan cities. So it first seized Jerusalem and Cesarea: afterward Philippi, Athens, Corinth, Ephesus, Rome itself.A centurion, or captain, of that called the Italian band - That is, troop or company.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ac10_2"><b>10:2</b></a></span></td><td><span>Who gave much alms to the people - That is, to the Jews, many of whom were at that time extremely poor.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ac10_3"><b>10:3</b></a></span></td><td><span>He saw in a vision - Not in a trance, like Peter: plainly, so as to leave one not accustomed to things of this kind no room to suspect any imposition.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ac10_4"><b>10:4</b></a></span></td><td><span>Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God - Dare any man say, These were only splendid sins? Or that they were an abomination before God? And yet it is certain, in the Christian sense Cornelius was then an unbeliever. He had not then faith in Christ. So certain it is, that every one who seeks faith in Christ, should seek it in prayer, and doing good to all men: though in strictness what is not exactly according to the Divine rule must stand in need of Divine favour and indulgence.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ac10_8"><b>10:8</b></a></span></td><td><span>A devout soldier - How many such attendants have our modern officers? A devout soldier would now be looked upon as little better than a deserter from his colours.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ac10_10"><b>10:10</b></a></span></td><td><span>And he became very hungry - At the usual meal time. The symbols in visions and trances, it is easy to observe, are generally suited to the state of the natural faculties.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ac10_11"><b>10:11</b></a></span></td><td><span>Tied at the corners - Not all in one knot, but each fastened as it were up to heaven.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ac10_14"><b>10:14</b></a></span></td><td><span>But Peter said, In nowise, Lord - When God commands a strange or seemingly improper thing, the first objection frequently finds pardon. But it ought not to be repeated. This doubt and delay of St. Peter had several good effects. Hereby the will of God in this important point was made more evident and incontestable.And Peter also, having been so slow of belief himself, could the more easily bear the doubting of his brethren,  <a href="/acts/11-2.html">Acts 11:2</a> , &c.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ac10_15"><b>10:15</b></a></span></td><td><span>What God hath purified - Hath made and declared clean. Nothing but what is clean can come down from heaven. St. Peter well remembered this saying in the council at Jerusalem,  <a href="/acts/15-9.html">Acts 15:9</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ac10_16"><b>10:16</b></a></span></td><td><span>This was done thrice - To make the deeper impression.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ac10_17"><b>10:17</b></a></span></td><td><span>While Peter doubted in himself, behold the men - Frequently the things which befall us within and from without at the same time, are a key to each other. The things which thus concur and agree together, ought to be diligently attended to.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ac10_19"><b>10:19</b></a></span></td><td><span>Behold three men seek thee, arise therefore and go down, and go with them, doubting nothing - How gradually was St. Peter prepared to receive this new admonition of the Spirit! Thus God is went to lead on his children by degrees, always giving them light for the present hour.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ac10_24"><b>10:24</b></a></span></td><td><span>Cornelius was waiting for them - Not engaging himself in any secular business during that solemn time, but being altogether intent on this one thing.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ac10_26"><b>10:26</b></a></span></td><td><span>I myself also am a man - And not God, who alone ought to be worshipped,  <a href="/matthew/4-10.html"> 4:10</a> . Have all his pretended successors attended to this?</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ac10_28"><b>10:28</b></a></span></td><td><span>But God hath showed me - He speaks sparingly to them of his former doubt, and his late vision.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ac10_29"><b>10:29</b></a></span></td><td><span>I ask for what intent ye have sent for me? - St. Peter knew this already. But he puts Cornelius on telling the story, both that the rest might be informed, and Cornelius himself more impressed by the narration: the repetition of which, even as we read it, gives a new dignity and spirit to Peter's succeeding discourse, </span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ac10_30"><b>10:30</b></a></span></td><td><span>Four days ago I was fasting - The first of these days he had the vision; the second his messengers came to Joppa; on the third, St. Peter set out; and on the fourth, came to Cesarea.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ac10_31"><b>10:31</b></a></span></td><td><span>Thy prayer is heard - Doubtless he had been praying for instruction, how to worship God in the most acceptable manner.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ac10_33"><b>10:33</b></a></span></td><td><span>Now therefore we are all present before God - The language of every truly Christian congregation.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ac10_34"><b>10:34</b></a></span></td><td><span>I perceive of a truth - More clearly than ever, from such a concurrence of circumstances. That God is not a respecter of persons - Is not partial in his love. The words mean, in a particular sense, that he does not confine his love to one nation; in a general, that he is loving to every man, and willeth all men should be saved.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ac10_35"><b>10:35</b></a></span></td><td><span>But in every nation he that feareth God and worketh righteousness - He that, first, reverences God, as great, wise, good, the cause, end, and governor of all things; and secondly, from this awful regard to him, not only avoids all known evil, but endeavours, according to the best light he has, to do all things well; is accepted of him - Through Christ, though he knows him not. The assertion is express, and admits of no exception.He is in the favour of God, whether enjoying his written word and ordinances or not. Nevertheless the addition of these is an unspeakable blessing to those who were before in some measure accepted. Otherwise God would never have sent an angel from heaven to direct Cornelius to St. Peter.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ac10_36"><b>10:36</b></a></span></td><td><span>This is the word which God sent - When he sent his Son into the world, preaching - Proclaiming by him - peace between God and man, whether Jew or Gentile, by the God - man. He is Lord of both; yea, Lord of and over all.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ac10_37"><b>10:37</b></a></span></td><td><span>Ye know the word which was published - You know the facts in general, the meaning of which I shall now more particularly explain and confirm to you. The baptism which John preached - To which he invited them by his preaching, in token of their repentance. This began in Galilee, which is near Cesarea.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ac10_38"><b>10:38</b></a></span></td><td><span>How God anointed Jesus - Particularly at his baptism, thereby inaugurating him to his office: with the Holy Ghost and with power - It is worthy our remark, that frequently when the Holy Ghost is mentioned there is added a word particularly adapted to the present circumstance. So the deacons were to be full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom,  <a href="/acts/6-3.html">Acts 6:3</a> . Barnabas was full of the Holy Ghost and faith,  <a href="/acts/11-24.html">Acts 11:24</a> . The disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Ghost,  <a href="/acts/13-52.html">Acts 13:52</a> .And here, where his mighty works are mentioned, Christ himself is said to be anointed with the Holy Ghost and with power.For God was with him - He speaks sparingly here of the majesty of Christ, as considering the state of his hearers.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ac10_41"><b>10:41</b></a></span></td><td><span>Not now to all the people - As before his death; to us who did eat and drink with him - That is, conversed familiarly and continually with him, in the time of his ministry.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ac10_42"><b>10:42</b></a></span></td><td><span>It is he who is ordained by God the Judge of the living and the dead - Of all men, whether they are alive at his coming, or had died before it. This was declaring to them, in the strongest terms, how entirely their happiness depended on a timely and humble subjection to him who was to be their final Judge.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ac10_43"><b>10:43</b></a></span></td><td><span>To him give all the prophets witness - Speaking to heathens he does not quote any in particular; that every one who believeth in him - Whether he be Jew or Gentile; receiveth remission of sins - Though he had not before either feared God, or worked righteousness.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ac10_44"><b>10:44</b></a></span></td><td><span>The Holy Ghost fell on all that were hearing the word - Thus were they consecrated to God, as the first fruits of the Gentiles.And thus did God give a clear and satisfactory evidence, that he had accepted them as well as the Jews.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ac10_45"><b>10:45</b></a></span></td><td><span>The believers of the circumcision - The believing Jews.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ac10_47"><b>10:47</b></a></span></td><td><span>Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, who have received the Holy Ghost? - He does not say they have the baptism of the Spirit; therefore they do not need baptism with water. But just the contrary: if they have received the Spirit, then baptize them with water. How easily is this question decided, if we will take the wordof God for our rule! Either men have received the Holy Ghost or not. If they have not, Repent, saith God, and be baptized, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. If they have, if they are already baptized with the Holy Ghost, then who can forbid water?</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ac10_48"><b>10:48</b></a></span></td><td><span>In the name of the Lord - Which implies the Father who anointed him, and the Spirit with which he was anointed to his office.But as the Gentiles had before believed in God the Father, and could not but now believe in the Holy Ghost, under whose powerful influence they were at this very time, there was the less need of taking notice, that they were baptized into the belief and profession of the sacred Three: though doubtless the apostle administered the ordinances in that very form which Christ himself had prescribed.</table><span><!--pageCount=1-->
