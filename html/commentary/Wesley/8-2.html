In whose sight - For though it was their duty to permit this, yet she thought it might perhaps be denied her; at least, that it became her modestly and humbly to acknowledge their kindness herein.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ru2_3"><b>2:3</b></a></span></td><td><span>Her hap - It was a chance in reference to second causes, but ordered by God's providence. God wisely orders small events, even those that seem altogether contingent. Many a great affair is brought about by a little turn, fortuitous as to men, but designed by God.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ru2_4"><b>2:4</b></a></span></td><td><span>Said, &c - They expressed their piety, even in their civil conversation, and worldly transactions; which now so many are ashamed of.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ru2_7"><b>2:7</b></a></span></td><td><span>I pray - She did not boldly intrude herself, but modestly ask leave of us.

What improvements have I made in grace or knowledge?What have I learned or done, which will turn to account?</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ru2_20"><b>2:20</b></a></span></td><td><span>To the dead - That is, which he formerly shewed to those who are now dead, my husband and his sons whilst they were living, and now continues to us.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ru2_21"><b>2:21</b></a></span></td><td><span>Harvest - Both barley - harvest, and wheat - harvest.
