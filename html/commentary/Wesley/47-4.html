We faint not - We desist not in any degree from our glorious enterprise.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Co4_2"><b>4:2</b></a></span></td><td><span>But have renounced - Set at open defiance. The hidden things of shame - All things which men need to hide, or to be ashamed of. Not walking in craftiness - Using no disguise, subtlety, guile. Nor privily corrupting the pure word of God - By any additions or alterations, or by attempting to accommodate it to the taste of the hearers.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Co4_3"><b>4:3</b></a></span></td><td><span>But if our gospel also - As well as the law of Moses.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Co4_4"><b>4:4</b></a></span></td><td><span>The God of this world - What a sublime and horrible description of Satan! He is indeed the god of all that believe not, and works in them with inconceivable energy. Hath blinded  - Not only veiled, the eye of their understanding. Illumination - Is properly the reflection or propagation of light, from thosewho are already enlightened, to others. Who is the image of God  - Hence also we may understand how great is the glory of Christ.He that sees the Son, sees the Father in the face of Christ.The Son exactly exhibits the Father to us.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Co4_5"><b>4:5</b></a></span></td><td><span>For - The fault is not in us, neither in the doctrine they hear from us.

In earthen vessels - In frail, feeble, perishing bodies. He proceeds to show, that afflictions, yea, death itself, are so far from hindering the ministration of the Spirit, that they even further it, sharpen the ministers, and increase the fruit.That the excellence of the power, which works these in us, may undeniably appear to be of God.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Co4_8"><b>4:8</b></a></span></td><td><span>We are troubled, &c. - The four articles in this verse respect inward, the four in the next outward, afflictions.In each clause the former part shows the "earthen vessels;" the latter, "the excellence of the power."

Yet - Living or dying, so long as we believe, we cannot but speak.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Co4_13"><b>4:13</b></a></span></td><td><span>Having the same spirit of faith - Which animated the saints of old; David, in particular, when he said, I believed, and therefore have I spoken - That is, I trusted in God, and therefore he hath put this song of praise in my mouth. We also speak - We preach the gospel, even in the midst of affliction and death, because we believe that God will raise us up from the dead, and will present us, ministers, with you, all his members, "faultless before his presence with exceeding joy."  <a href="/psalms/116-10.html"> 116:10</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Co4_15"><b>4:15</b></a></span></td><td><span>For all things - Whether adverse or prosperous.
