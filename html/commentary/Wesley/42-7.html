To avoid all suspicion of this kind, he deferred his commendation of him, till the messengers were gone; and then delivered it to the people, to prevent all imaginations, as if John were wavering in his judgment, and had sent the two disciples for his own, rather than their satisfaction.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Lu7_27"><b>7:27</b></a></span></td><td><span>  <a href="/malachi/3-1.html">Malachi 3:1</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Lu7_28"><b>7:28</b></a></span></td><td><span>There is not a greater prophet than John - A greater teacher.But he that is least in the kingdom of God - The least teacher whom I send forth.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Lu7_29"><b>7:29</b></a></span></td><td><span>And all the people - Our Lord continues his discourse: justified God - Owned his wisdom and mercy in thus calling them to repentance, and preparing them for Him that was to come.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Lu7_30"><b>7:30</b></a></span></td><td><span>But the Pharisees and scribes - The good, learned, honourable men: made void the counsel, the gracious design, of God toward them - They disappointed all these methods of his love, and would receive no benefit from them.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Lu7_32"><b>7:32</b></a></span></td><td><span>They are like children sitting in the market place - So froward and perverse, that no contrivance can be found to please them.It is plain our Lord means, that they were like the children complained of, not like those that made the complaint.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Lu7_34"><b>7:34</b></a></span></td><td><span>But wisdom is justified by all her children - The children of wisdom are those who are truly wise unto salvation.
