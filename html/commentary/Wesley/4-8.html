Over against the candlestick - On that part which is before the candlestick, Heb. over against the face of the candlestick - That is, in that place towards which the candlestick looked, or where the candlestick stood in full view, that is, upon the north - side, where the table of shew - bread stood, as appears from hence, because the candlestick stood close to the boards of the sanctuary on the south - side,  <a href="/exodus/26-35.html"> 26:35</a> . And thus the lights were on both sides of the sanctuary, which was necessary, because it was dark in itself, and had no window.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu8_4"><b>8:4</b></a></span></td><td><span>Of beaten gold - Not hollow, but solid gold, beaten out of one piece, not of several pieces joined or soldered together.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu8_7"><b>8:7</b></a></span></td><td><span>Of purifying - Heb. of sin, that is, for the expiation of sin.This water was mixed with the ashes of a red heifer,  <a href="/numbers/19-9.html">Numbers 19:9</a> , which therefore may seem to have been prescribed before, though it be mentioned after; such kind of transplacings of passages being frequent in scripture.Shave all their flesh - This external rite signified the cutting off their inordinate desire of earthly things and that singular purity of heart and life which is required in the ministers of God.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu8_8"><b>8:8</b></a></span></td><td><span>A young bullock - The same sacrifice which was offered for a sin - offering for the whole congregation, because the Levites came in the stead of all the first - born, who did in a manner represent the whole congregation.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu8_10"><b>8:10</b></a></span></td><td><span>The children of Israel - Not all of them, which was impossible, but some in the name of all the princes or chiefs of each tribe, who used to transact things in the name of their tribes. Put their hands - Whereby they signified their transferring that right of ministering to God from the first - born in whose hands it formerly was, to the Levites, and their entire resignation and dedication of them to God's service.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu8_11"><b>8:11</b></a></span></td><td><span>For an offering - Heb. for a wave - offering. Not that Aaron did so wave them, which he could not do, but that he caused them to imitate that motion, and to wave themselves toward the several parts of the world: whereby they might signify their readiness to serve God, according to their capacity wheresoever they should be.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu8_12"><b>8:12</b></a></span></td><td><span>Lay their hands - To signify that they were offered by them and for them.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu8_13"><b>8:13</b></a></span></td><td><span>Set the Levites before Aaron - Give the Levites to them, or to their service.
