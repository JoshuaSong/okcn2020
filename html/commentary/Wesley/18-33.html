		<span><span><center><b>The Book of Job<br>Chapter 33</b></center></span><p><span><b>Chapter Overview:</B></span><blockquote><br>  Elihu offers himself to Job as the person he had so often wished  for, ver. 1 - 7.<br>  He charges him with reflecting upon God, ver. 8 - 11.<br>  He aggravates this by shewing him God's sovereign power over man, and  the various means he uses to do him good, ver. 12 - 14.<br>  Particularly dreams, ver. 15 - 18.<br>  And sickness, ver. 19 - 30.<br>  He requests Job to answer him, or let him go on, ver. 31 - 33.<br></BLOCKQUOTE><span><b>Verses:</B></span><br><TABLE WIDTH="100%" CELLPADDING="4" CELLSPACING="0" BORDER="0"><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job33_3"><b>33:3</b></a></span></td><td><span>My words - I will not speak passionately or partially, but from a sincere desire to do thee good. Clearly - What I speak will be plain, not hard to be understood.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job33_4"><b>33:4</b></a></span></td><td><span>Life - I am thy fellow creature, and am ready to discourse with thee upon even terms, according to thy desire.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job33_6"><b>33:6</b></a></span></td><td><span>Behold - I will plead with thee in God's name and stead, which thou hast often wished, and I am God's creature like thyself.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job33_9"><b>33:9</b></a></span></td><td><span>Clean - Not absolutely, for he often confesses himself to be a sinner, but no such transgression, as might give God just occasion to punish him so severely, as is implied, where he blames God for finding occasions against him, implying that he had given him none by his sins.And thus far Elihu's charge was just, and herein it differs from the charge of Job's three friends, who often accuse him, for asserting his own innocency; although they did it, because they thought him an hypocrite, whereas Elihu does it upon other grounds, even because Job's justification of himself was accompanied with reflections upon God.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job33_11"><b>33:11</b></a></span></td><td><span>Marketh - He narrowly prys into all my actions, that he may find matter against me.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job33_12"><b>33:12</b></a></span></td><td><span>Not just - Thou art in the wrong. Greater - Not only in power and majesty, but also in justice, and wisdom, and goodness, and therefore thou dost foolishly, in censuring his judgments, thou castest off that awe and reverence which thou shouldest constantly maintain towards thy sovereign Lord.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job33_13"><b>33:13</b></a></span></td><td><span>He - Useth not to give an account to his creatures of the grounds and reasons of his judgments or dispensations as being the supreme governor of all persons and things, in whose will it becometh all men to acquiesce.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job33_14"><b>33:14</b></a></span></td><td><span>Yet - Although he doth not give men an account of his matters, yet he doth that which is sufficient for them. Twice - When once speaking doth not awaken men, God is graciously pleased to give them another admonition: though he will not gratify men's curiosity in enquiring into his hidden judgments, yet he will acquaint them with their duty. God speaks to us by conscience, by providence, and by ministers, of all which Elihu here treats at large, to shew Job, that God was now telling him his mind, and endeavouring to do him good. He shews first, how God admonishes men by their own consciences.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job33_16"><b>33:16</b></a></span></td><td><span>Sealeth - He imprints those instructions upon their minds.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job33_17"><b>33:17</b></a></span></td><td><span>Pride - And God by this means is said to hide pride from man, because by these glorious representations of his Divine majesty to man, he takes him off from the admiration of his own excellency, and brings him to a sight of his own weakness, and to an humble and ready submission to his will.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job33_18"><b>33:18</b></a></span></td><td><span>Keepeth - By his gracious admonitions whereby he leads him to repentance.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job33_19"><b>33:19</b></a></span></td><td><span>Pain - The second way whereby God instructs men and excites them to repentance.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job33_22"><b>33:22</b></a></span></td><td><span>The destroyers - The pangs of death, here called the destroyers, are just ready to seize him.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job33_23"><b>33:23</b></a></span></td><td><span>A messenger - A prophet or teacher. To expound the providence, and point out the design of God therein. One, &c. - A person rightly qualified for this great and hard work, such as there are but very few.To shew - To direct him to the right way how he may please God, and procure that mercy which he thirsts after; which is not by quarrelling with God, but by an humble confession. and supplication for mercy through Christ the redeemer.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job33_24"><b>33:24</b></a></span></td><td><span>He - God. A ransom - Although I might justly destroy him, yet I will spare him, for I have found out a way of ransoming sinners from death, which is the death of my son, the redeemer of the world, and with respect to which I will pardon them that repent and sue for mercy. Observe how God glories in the invention! I have found, I have found a ransom; a ransom for poor, undone sinners! I, even I am he that hath done it.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job33_26"><b>33:26</b></a></span></td><td><span>Render - He will deal with him as with one reconciled to him through the mediator, and turning from sin to righteousness.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job33_28"><b>33:28</b></a></span></td><td><span>Life - His life which was endangered, shall be restored and continued. Yea, farther, God shall Deliver his soul from going into the pit of hell: and his life shall see the light, all good, in the vision and fruition of God.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job33_29"><b>33:29</b></a></span></td><td><span>Lo - All these ways God uses to convince, and save sinners.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job33_30"><b>33:30</b></a></span></td><td><span>To bring - That he may save men from being forever miserable, and make them forever happy. "Lord, what is man, that thou shouldest thus visit him? This should engage us, to comply with God's designs, to work with him for our own good, and not to counter - work him. And this will render those that perish inexcusable, that, so much was done to save them, and they would not he healed." So Mr. Henry.Excellent words! But how much did God do to save them? Did he ever do any thing to save them? Did he ever design to save them?If not, how does that which was never done, no nor designed, "render them inexcusable?"</table><span><!--pageCount=1-->
