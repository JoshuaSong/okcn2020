		<span><span><center><b>The Book of Psalms<br>Chapter 47</b></center></span><p><span><b>Chapter Overview:</B></span><blockquote><br>  This psalm seems to have been composed upon the occasion of carrying  the ark from the house of Obed - edom into the city of Zion,   <a href="default.aspx?reference=+6:12"> 6:12</a> ,17.<br>  But as Zion was a type of the church, and the ark a type of Christ,  so it has a farther reference, even to Christ's ascension into heaven,  and to the spreading of his kingdom in all parts of the world.  It contains an exhortation to rejoice in God, ver. 1 - 4.<br>  A prophecy of Christ's ascension, and of the calling of the Gentiles,  ver. 5 - 9.<br>  To the chief musician, A psalm for the sons of Korah. </BLOCKQUOTE><span><b>Verses:</B></span><br><TABLE WIDTH="100%" CELLPADDING="4" CELLSPACING="0" BORDER="0"><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ps47_3"><b>47:3</b></a></span></td><td><span>Subdue - He speaks this in the name of the whole church, to which all particular believers were to submit themselves in the Lord.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ps47_4"><b>47:4</b></a></span></td><td><span>Chuse - He will appoint and bestow upon us.
