This expression intimates, that all afflictions are sent by God, and come at his call or command. Seven years - A double time to the former famine under Elijah, which is but just, because they were still incorrigible under all the judgments of God, and the powerful ministry of Elisha.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Ki8_3"><b>8:3</b></a></span></td><td><span>Her house - Which having been forsaken by her, were possessed by her kindred.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Ki8_4"><b>8:4</b></a></span></td><td><span>Gehazi the servant - Formerly his servant.

To which the answer is, thou mayest, notwithstanding thy disease, which is not mortal. The latter words contain the prophet's addition to that answer, which is, that he should die, not by the power of his disease, but by some other cause.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Ki8_11"><b>8:11</b></a></span></td><td><span>He settled - The prophet fixed his eyes upon Hazael.Until - 'Till Hazael was ashamed, as apprehending the prophet discerned something of an evil and shameful nature in him.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Ki8_13"><b>8:13</b></a></span></td><td><span>A dog - So fierce, barbarous, and inhuman.

This unequal marriage, though Jehoshaphat possibly designed it as a means of uniting the two kingdoms under one head, is here and elsewhere noted, as the cause both of the great wickedness of his posterity, and of those sore calamities which befel them. No good could be reasonably expected from such an union. Those that are ill matched are already half - ruined.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Ki8_19"><b>8:19</b></a></span></td><td><span>Alway - Until the coming of the Messiah: for so long, and not longer, this succession might seem necessary for the making good of God's promise and covenant made with David. But when the Messiah, was once come, there was no more need of any succession, and the scepter might and did without any inconvenience depart from Judah, and from all the succeeding branches of David's family, because the Messiah was to hold the kingdom forever in his own person, though not in so gross a way as the carnal Jews imagined. A light - A son and successor.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Ki8_29"><b>8:29</b></a></span></td><td><span>Ramah - The same place with Ramoth, or Ramoth - Gilead.</table><span><!--pageCount=1-->
