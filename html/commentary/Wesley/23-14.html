But this was more eminently verified in a spiritual sense, in the days of the gospel.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa14_4"><b>14:4</b></a></span></td><td><span>Golden city - As they used to call themselves; which therefore he expresses here in a word of their own language.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa14_6"><b>14:6</b></a></span></td><td><span>Anger - With rigour and not with clemency.

Viols - All thy musical instruments, which were much used in Babylon, and were doubtless used in Belshazzar's solemn feasts,  <a href="/daniel/5-1.html">Daniel 5:1</a> , at which time the city was taken; to which possibly the prophet here alludes. The worm - Instead of those stately carpets upon which thou didst frequently tread.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa14_12"><b>14:12</b></a></span></td><td><span>Fallen - From the height of thy glory. Lucifer - Which properly is a bright star, that ushers in the morning; but is here metaphorically taken for the mighty king of Babylon. Son - The title of son is given in scripture not only to a person or thing begotten or produced by another, but also to any thing which is related, to it, in which sense we read of the son of a night,  <a href="/jonah/4-10.html"> 4:10</a> , a son of perdition,  <a href="/john/17-12.html"> 17:12</a> , and, which is more agreeable, to the present case, the sons of Arcturus,  <a href="/job/38-32.html">Job 38:32</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa14_13"><b>14:13</b></a></span></td><td><span>I - I will advance myself above the state of a weak man.Above - Above all other kings and potentates; or, above the most eminent persons of God's church.

Raiment - Which, being mangled, and besmeared with mire, and blood, was cast away with contempt. Go down - Who being slain, are cast into some pit. He saith, to the stones of the pit, because when dead bodies are cast in thither, men use to throw an heap of stones upon them. Trodden - Neglected, like such a carcase. And this might literally happen to Belshazzar's dead body.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa14_20"><b>14:20</b></a></span></td><td><span>Joined - Not buried as they are. Slain - Thou hast exercised great tyranny and cruelty, not only to thine enemies, but even to thine own subjects. The seed - Such as Belshazzar was, being descended from that Nebuchadnezzar who had made such horrid slaughters and devastations in the world, merely to gratify his own insatiable lusts, and who had been so impious towards God and his temple, and so bloody towards his church and people. Renowned - Or, shall not be renowned for ever: although I have long borne with thee and thy family.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa14_21"><b>14:21</b></a></span></td><td><span>Children - Cut off all the branches of the royal family.Rise - Not recover their former power.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa14_22"><b>14:22</b></a></span></td><td><span>Remnant - The remembrance of those that are dead, and the persons of those who yet survive.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa14_23"><b>14:23</b></a></span></td><td><span>Bittern - A great water fowl, which delights in solitary places, as also in watery grounds. Such as those were about Babylon.Pools - The ground about Babylon was of itself very moist, because of the great river Euphrates, running by it, which was kept from overflowing the country with charge and labour; this being neglected, when the city was destroyed, it was easily turned into pools of water.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa14_24"><b>14:24</b></a></span></td><td><span>Saying - This verse does not only concern Babylon's destruction, but also the overthrow of Sennacherib and the Assyrian host, which was a pledge of the destruction of the city and empire of Babylon.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa14_25"><b>14:25</b></a></span></td><td><span>My land - In Judea, which is my land in a peculiar manner.Mountains - In my mountainous country, for such Judea was, especially about Jerusalem.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa14_26"><b>14:26</b></a></span></td><td><span>The earth - Upon this vast empire, now in the hands of the Assyrians, and shortly to come into the hands of the Babylonians.The hand - The providence of God executing his purpose.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa14_28"><b>14:28</b></a></span></td><td><span>This burden - This following burdensome prophecy concerning the Philistines, who in Ahaz's time, made an inroad into Judah, and took divers of their cities.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa14_29"><b>14:29</b></a></span></td><td><span>Of him - Most understand this of Uzziah, who did then much mischief,  <a href="/2-chronicles/26-3.html">2&nbsp;Chronicles 26:3</a> ,6. But he was dead thirty - two years before this time, and therefore their joy for his death was long since past. Others understand it of Ahaz: but he was so far from smiting them, that he was smitten by them. We may understand this of the royal race of Judah, who had been a terrible scourge to them, whose rod might be said to be broken, because that scepter was come into the hands of slothful princes.A serpent - From the root of David shall come Hezekiah, who, like a serpent, shall sting thee to death, as he did,  <a href="/2-kings/18-8.html"> 18:8</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa14_30"><b>14:30</b></a></span></td><td><span>The poor - The people of the Jews, who are brought to extreme poverty. The title of first - born is given to persons or things which are most eminent in their kinds, as to the people of Israel,  <a href="/exodus/4-22.html">Exodus 4:22</a> ,to David,  <a href="/psalms/89-27.html">Psalms 89:27</a>   <a href="/isaiah/14.html">isa 14:</a> ,  <a href="/job/18-13.html">Job 18:13</a> , and here to persons eminently poor.
