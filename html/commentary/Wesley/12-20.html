Not live - Such threatenings, though absolutely expressed, have often secret conditions.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Ki20_2"><b>20:2</b></a></span></td><td><span>Turned his face - As he lay in his bed. He could not retire to his closet, but he retired as well as he could, turned from the company, to converse with God.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Ki20_3"><b>20:3</b></a></span></td><td><span>In truth - Sincerely with an honest mind. I am not conscious to myself of any gross exorbitances, for which thou usest to shorten mens days. Wept - For that horror of death which is and was common to men, especially, in the times of the Old Testament, when the grace of God in Christ was not so fully manifested, as now it is: and, for the distracted condition in which the church and state were then likely to be left, through the uncertainty of the succession to the crown.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Ki20_4"><b>20:4</b></a></span></td><td><span>Court - Of the king's palace. This is noted to shew God's great readiness to hear the prayers of his children.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Ki20_5"><b>20:5</b></a></span></td><td><span>God of, &c. - I am mindful of my promise made to David and his house, and will make it good in thy person. Shalt go - To give me solemn praise for this mercy.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Ki20_6"><b>20:6</b></a></span></td><td><span>Fifteen years - We have not an instance of any other, who was told before - hand just how long, he should live. God has wisely kept us at uncertainties, that we may be always ready.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Ki20_10"><b>20:10</b></a></span></td><td><span>Go down - In an instant: for that motion of the sun is natural for the kind of it, though miraculous for the swiftness of it; but the other would be both ways miraculous.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Ki20_11"><b>20:11</b></a></span></td><td><span>Degrees - These degrees were lines in the dial: but whether each of these lines or degrees noted an hour, or half an hour, or a quarter of an hour, is uncertain. But the sun itself went back, and the shadow with it. This miracle was noted by the Babylonians, who, having understood that it was done for Hezekiah's sake, sent to enquire into the truth and manner of it,  <a href="/2-chronicles/32-31.html">2&nbsp;Chronicles 32:31</a> .Of Ahaz - Which Ahaz had made in the king's palace. This dial he mentions, because the truth of the miracle might be best and soonest discovered there, this dial possibly being visible out of the king's chamber, and the degrees being most distinct and conspicuous in it.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Ki20_12"><b>20:12</b></a></span></td><td><span>Berodach - baladan - He seems to have been the king of Assyria's vice - roy in Babylon, and upon that terrible slaughter in the Assyrian host, and the death of Sennacherib, and the differences among his sons, to have usurped absolute sovereignty over Babylon. And either himself or his son destroyed the Assyrian monarchy, and translated the empire to Babylon. Sent - Partly, for the reasons mentioned,  <a href="/2-chronicles/32-31.html">2&nbsp;Chronicles 32:31</a> , and partly, to assure himself of the assistance of Hezekiah against the Assyrians, their common enemy.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Ki20_13"><b>20:13</b></a></span></td><td><span>His treasures - For though his country had lately been harassed by the Assyrians, yet he had reserved all his treasures and precious things, which he and his fathers had gathered in Jerusalem. Besides, he had considerable spoils out of the Assyrian camp. Also he had many presents sent to him,  <a href="/2-chronicles/32-23.html">2&nbsp;Chronicles 32:23</a> .Shewed - Which he did through pride of heart,  <a href="/2-chronicles/32-25.html">2&nbsp;Chronicles 32:25</a> ,26, being lifted up by the great honour which God had done him, in working such glorious miracles for his sake, and by the great respects rendered to him from divers princes, and now by this great Babylonian monarch.So hard a matter is it even for a good man to be high and humble.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Ki20_17"><b>20:17</b></a></span></td><td><span>Behold - This judgment is denounced against him for his pride; for his ingratitude, whereby he took that honour to himself which he should have given entirely to God; and for his carnal confidence in that league which he had now made with the king of Babylon, by which, it is probable, he thought his mountain to be so strong, that it could not be removed.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Ki20_18"><b>20:18</b></a></span></td><td><span>Thy sons - Of thy grand - children. Eunuchs - They shall be servants to that heathen monarch, whereby both their bodies will be subject to slavery, and their souls exposed to the peril of idolatry, and all sorts of wickedness.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Ki20_19"><b>20:19</b></a></span></td><td><span>Good is, &c. - I heartily submit to this sentence, as being both just, and merciful. True penitents, when they are under divine rebukes, call them not only just, but good. Not only submit to, but accept of the punishment of their iniquity. So Hezekiah did, and by this it appeared, he was indeed humbled for the pride of his heart.</table><span><!--pageCount=1-->
