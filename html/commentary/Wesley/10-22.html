		<span><span><center><b>The Book of 2&nbsp;Samuel<br>Chapter 22</b></center></span><p><span><b>Chapter Overview:</B></span><blockquote><br>  This chapter is inserted among the Psalms, No. 18, with some<br>little variation. It is here as it was composed for his own closet; there, as it was delivered to the chief musician for public service.The inspired writer having largely related David's deliverances in this and the foregoing book, thought fit to record this sacred poem, as a memorial of all that had been before related.</BLOCKQUOTE><span><!--pageCount=1-->
