Asked not - That in times past made no enquiry after me; l am now found by them that formerly sought me not.I said - I invited whole nations by the preaching of my gospel to behold me, and that with importunity, doubling my words upon them, and this I did unto a nation not called by my name, with whom I was not in covenant.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa65_2"><b>65:2</b></a></span></td><td><span>I have spread - Applied to the Jews,  <a href="/romans/10-21.html">Romans 10:21</a> .I have stretched out my hands, I have used all means to reduce them, I have stretched out the hands of a passionate orator to persuade them, of a liberal benefactor to load them with my benefits; this I have done continually in the whole course of my providence with them.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa65_3"><b>65:3</b></a></span></td><td><span>To my face - With the utmost impudence, not taking notice of God's omnipresence, and omniscience.
