All the wisdom which is in the world, lives in you, and will be utterly lost when you die.When wise and good men die, it is a comfort to think that wisdom and goodness do not die with them: it is folly to think, that there will be a great, irreparable loss of us when we are gone, since God has the residue of the spirit, and can raise up others more fit to do his work.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job12_3"><b>12:3</b></a></span></td><td><span>But - In these things, which he speaks not in a way of boasting, but for the just vindication both of himself, and of that cause of God, which for the substance of it he maintained rightly, as God himself attests, chap. <a href="/job/42-7.html">42:7</a> .Such things - The truth is, neither you nor I have any reason to be puffed up with our knowledge of these things: for the most barbarous nations know that God is infinite in wisdom, and power, and justice. But this is not the question between you and me.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job12_4"><b>12:4</b></a></span></td><td><span>Upon God - Even by my religious neighbours, by those who call upon God, and not in vain; whose prayers therefore I covet, not their reproaches. The just - I, who, notwithstanding all their hard censures dare still own it, that through God's grace I am an upright man.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job12_5"><b>12:5</b></a></span></td><td><span>Slip with his feet - And fall into trouble; tho' he had formerly shone as a lamp, he is then looked upon as a lamp going out, as the snuff of a candle, which we throw to the ground and tread upon; and accordingly is despised in the thought of him that is at ease.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job12_6"><b>12:6</b></a></span></td><td><span>Are secure - Job's friends had all supposed, that wicked men cannot prosper long in the world. This Job opposes, and maintains, that God herein acts as sovereign, and reserves that exact distribution of rewards and punishments for the other world.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job12_7"><b>12:7</b></a></span></td><td><span>But - If thou observest the beasts, and their properties and actions, and events, from them thou mayst learn this lesson: that which Zophar had uttered with so much pomp and gravity, chap. <a href="/job/11-7.html">11:7</a> ,8,9, concerning God's infinite wisdom, saith Job, thou needest not go into heaven or hell to know. but thou mayst learn it even from the beasts.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job12_9"><b>12:9</b></a></span></td><td><span>Lord - This is the only time that we meet with the name Jehovah in all the discourses between Job and his friends.

Yea, he shuts up in the grave, and none can break open those sealed doors.

He governs the deceiver and sets bounds to his deceits, how far they shall extend; he also over - rules all this to his own glory, and the accomplishment of his righteous designs of trying the good, and punishing wicked men, by giving them up to believe lies. Yet God is not the author of any error or sin, but only the wise and holy governor of it.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job12_17"><b>12:17</b></a></span></td><td><span>Spoiled - The wise counsellors or statesmen, by whom the affairs of kings and kingdoms are ordered, he leadeth away as captives in triumph, being spoiled either of that wisdom which they had, or seemed to have; or of that power and dignity which they had enjoyed. Fools - By discovering their folly, and by infatuating their minds, and turning their own counsels to their ruin.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job12_18"><b>12:18</b></a></span></td><td><span>Looseth - He freeth them from that wherewith they bind their subjects to obedience, their power and authority, and that majesty which God stamps upon kings, to keep their people in awe. Girdeth - He reduces them to a mean and servile condition; which is thus expressed, because servants did use to gird up their garments (that after the manner of those parts were loose and long) that they might be fitter for attendance upon their masters: he not only deposes them from their thrones, but brings them into slavery.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job12_20"><b>12:20</b></a></span></td><td><span>The speech - By taking away or restraining the gift of utterance from them.
