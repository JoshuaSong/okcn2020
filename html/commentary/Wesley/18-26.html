Dost thou think I do not know, that which the meanest persons are not unacquainted with; that God is incomparably greater and better than his creatures? Whose spirit - Who inspired thee with this profound discourse of thine?</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job26_5"><b>26:5</b></a></span></td><td><span>Dead things - Job having censured Bildad's discourse, proceeds to shew how little he needed his information in that point. Here he shews that the power and providences of God reaches not only to the things we see, but also to the invisible parts of the world, not only to the heavens above and their inhabitants, and to men upon earth, of which Bildad discoursed, chap. <a href="/job/25-2.html">25:2</a> ,3, but also to such persons or things as are under the earth, or under the waters; which are out of our sight and reach; yet not out of the ken of Divine providence. These words may be understood; either, <ol><li> of dead, or lifeless things, such as amber, pearl,      coral, metals, or other minerals, which are formed or      brought forth; by the almighty power of God, from under      the waters; either in the bottom of the sea, or within      the earth, which is the lowest element, and in the scripture      and other authors spoken of as under the waters; this being      observed as a remarkable work of God's providence, that the      waters of the sea, which are higher than the earth, do not      overwhelm it. Or,<li> of dead men, and of the worst of them, such as died in their      sins, and after death were condemned to farther miseries; for      of such this very word seems to be used,  <a href="/proverbs/2-18.html">Proverbs 2:18</a> <a href="/proverbs/9-18.html">9:18</a>,       who are here said to mourn or groan from under the waters;      from the lower parts of the earth, or from under those      subterranean waters, which are supposed to be within and under      the earth; <a href="/psalms/33-7.html"> 33:7</a>,      and from under the inhabitants thereof; either of the      waters or of the earth, under which these waters are, or      with the other inhabitants thereof; of that place under      the waters, namely, the apostate spirits.</ol> So the sense is, that God's dominion is over all men, yea, even thedead, and the worst of them, who though they would not own God, nor his providence, while they lived, yet now are forced to acknowledge and feel that power which they despised, and bitterly mourn under the sad effects of it in their infernal habitations.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job26_6"><b>26:6</b></a></span></td><td><span>Hell - Is in his presence, and under his providence. Hell itself, that place of utter darkness, is not hid from his sight.Destruction - The place of destruction.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job26_7"><b>26:7</b></a></span></td><td><span>North - The northern part of the heavens, which is put for the whole visible heaven, because Job and his friends lived in a northern climate. Nothing - Upon no props or pillars, but his own power and providence.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job26_9"><b>26:9</b></a></span></td><td><span>Holdeth - From our view, that his glory may not dazzle our sight; he covereth it with a cloud.

Astonished - When God reproveth not them, but men by them, manifesting his displeasure by thunders, or earthquakes.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job26_14"><b>26:14</b></a></span></td><td><span>Parts - But small parcels, the outside and visible work.Portion - Of his power and wisdom, and providence.
