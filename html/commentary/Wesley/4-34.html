Which are here particularly described, <ol><li> to direct and bound them in their wars and conquests, that they might notseek the enlargement of their empire, after the manner of other nations, but be contented with their own portion.<li> To encourage them in their attempt upon Canaan, and assure them oftheir success. There was a much larger possession promised them, if they were obedient, even to the river Euphrates. But this, which is properly Canaan, lay in a very little compass. 'Tis but about an hundred and fifty miles in length, and about fifty in breadth. This was that little spot of ground, in which alone for many ages God was known! But its littleness was abundantly compensated by its fruitfulness: otherwise it could not have sustained so numerous a nation. See, how little a share of the world God often gives to his own people! But they that have their portion in heaven, can be content with a small pittance of this earth.</ol><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu34_3"><b>34:3</b></a></span></td><td><span>Your fourth quarter - Which is here described from east to west by divers windings and turnings, by reason of the mountains and rivers.The salt sea - So called from the salt and sulphurous taste of its waters.
