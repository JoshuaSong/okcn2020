		<span><span><center><b>The Book of Psalms<br>Chapter 72</b></center></span><p><span><b>Chapter Overview:</B></span><blockquote><br>  Divers passages of this psalm, do not agree to Solomon, nor to  any other king but the Messiah. It must therefore be acknowledged,  that, this is a mixt psalm, belonging to Solomon imperfectly, but  to Christ, clearly and fully: diverse expressions being so ordered,  that the reader might be led by them to the contemplation of Christ,  and of his kingdom. Which was the more necessary for the support of  God's true Israel, because the spirit of God foresaw Solomon's  dreadful apostacy, and the great miscarriages and calamities of his  successors, and of the kingdom under their hands, and therefore was  pleased to fortify their hearts with that glorious condition, which  they should certainly enjoy under the Messiah. It is probable, David  dictated this psalm, a little before he died, when he gave orders to  proclaim Solomon king.  After a short prayer for his successor, he foretells the glories of his  reign, ver. 1 - 17.<br>  And concludes with praise to the God of Israel, ver. 18 - 20.<br>  A psalm for Solomon. </BLOCKQUOTE><span><b>Verses:</B></span><br><TABLE WIDTH="100%" CELLPADDING="4" CELLSPACING="0" BORDER="0"><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ps72_1"><b>72:1</b></a></span></td><td><span>Judgments - He saith judgments in the plural number, because though the office of judging and ruling was but one, yet there were divers parts and branches, of it; in all which he begs that Solomon may be directed to do as God would have him to do.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ps72_2"><b>72:2</b></a></span></td><td><span>Thy afflicted ones - For such are thine in a special manner, thou art their judge and patron.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ps72_3"><b>72:3</b></a></span></td><td><span>The mountains - Which are so dangerous to passengers, in regard of robbers and wild beasts.
