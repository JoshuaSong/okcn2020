And if Baasha had done this inobedience to God's command, and with a single design, to execute God'svengeance threatened against him, it had been no more a sin, than Jehu'sact in killing his master king Jehoram, upon the same account, <a href="/2-kings/9-24.html"> 9:24</a> .But Baasha did this, merely to gratify his own pride, or covetousness,or malice, ver.  <a href="/1-kings/16-7.html">7</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Ki16_7"><b>16:7</b></a></span></td><td><span>Came, &c. - The meaning is, the message which came from the Lord to Jehu, ver.  <a href="/1-kings/16-1.html">1</a> , &c. was here deliveredby the hand, the ministry of Jehu, unto Baasha.

But why in all these confusions of the kingdom of Israel,did they never think of returning to the house of David?Probably because the kings of Judah assumed a more absolute power thanthe kings of Israel.
