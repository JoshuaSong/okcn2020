But if we have a divine evidence of things not seen, if we have "a hope full of immortality," if we now taste of "the powers of the world to come," and see "the crown that fadeth not away," then, notwithstanding" allour present trials, we are more happy than all men.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Co15_20"><b>15:20</b></a></span></td><td><span>But now - St. Paul declares that Christians "have hope," not "in this life only." His proof of the resurrection lies in a narrow compass,  <a href="/1-corinthians/15-12.html"> 15:12</a> - 19. Almost all the rest of the chapter is taken up in illustrating, vindicating, and applying it. The proof is short, but solid and convincing, that which arose from Christ's resurrection. Now this not only proved a resurrection possible, but, as it proved him to be a divine teacher, proved the certainty of a general resurrection, which he so expressly taught. The first fruit of them that slept - The earnest, pledge, and insurance of their resurrection who slept in him: even of all the righteous. It is of the resurrection of these, and these only, that the apostle speaks throughout the chapter.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Co15_22"><b>15:22</b></a></span></td><td><span>As through Adam all, even the righteous, die, so through Christ all these shall be made alive - He does not say, "shall revive," (as naturally as they die,) but shall be madealive, by a power not their own.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Co15_23"><b>15:23</b></a></span></td><td><span>Afterward - The whole harvest.

Cometh the end - Of the world; the grand period of all those wonderful scenes that have appeared for so many succeeding generations. When he shall have delivered up the kingdom to the Father, and he (the Father) shall have abolished all adverse rule, authority, and power - Not that the Father will then begin to reign without the Son, nor will the Son then cease to reign. For the divine reign both of the Father and Son is from everlasting to everlasting. But this is spoken of the Son's mediatorial kingdom, which will then be delivered up, and of the immediate kingdom or reign of the Father, which will then commence. Till then the Son transacts the business which the Father hath given him, for those who are his, and by them as well as by the angels, with the Father, and against their enemies. So far as the Father gave the kingdom to the Son, the Son shall deliver it up to the Father,  <a href="/john/13-3.html"> 13:3</a> . Nor does the Father cease to reign, when he gives it to the Son; neither the Son, when he delivers it to the Father: but the glory which he had before the world began,  <a href="/john/17-5.html"> 17:5</a> ; Heb 1:8, will remain even after this is delivered up. Nor will he cease to be a king even in his human nature,  <a href="/luke/1-33.html"> 1:33</a> .

In the same order they prevailed. Satan brought in sin, and sin brought forth death. And Christ, when he of old engaged with these enemies, first conquered Satan, then sin, in his death; and, lastly, death, in his resurrection. In the same order he delivers all the faithful from them, yea, and destroys these enemies themselves. Death he so destroys that it shall be no more; sin and Satan, so that they shall no more hurt his people.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Co15_27"><b>15:27</b></a></span></td><td><span>Under him - Under the Son.  <a href="/psalms/8-6.html"> 8:6</a> ,7</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Co15_28"><b>15:28</b></a></span></td><td><span>The Son also shall be subject - Shall deliver up the mediatorial kingdom. That the three - one God may be all in all - All things, (consequently all persons,) without any interruption, without the intervention of any creature, without the opposition of any enemy, shall be subordinate to God. All shall say, "My God, and my all." This is the end.Even an inspired apostle can see nothing beyond this.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Co15_29"><b>15:29</b></a></span></td><td><span>Who are baptized for the dead - Perhaps baptized in hope of blessings to be received after they are numbered with the dead. Or, "baptized in the room of the dead" - Of them that are just fallen in the cause of Christ: like soldiers who advance in the room of their companions that fell just before their face.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Co15_30"><b>15:30</b></a></span></td><td><span>Why are we - The apostles.

This seems to have been but just before. Let as eat, &c. - We might, on that supposition, as well say, with the Epicureans, Let us make the best of this short life, seeing we have no other portion.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Co15_33"><b>15:33</b></a></span></td><td><span>Be not deceived - By such pernicious counsels as this.Evil communications corrupt good manners - He opposes to the Epicurean saying, a well - known verse of the poet Menander.Evil communications - Discourse contrary to faith, hope, or love, naturally tends to destroy all holiness.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Co15_34"><b>15:34</b></a></span></td><td><span>Awake - An exclamation full of apostolical majesty.Shake off your lethargy! To righteousness - Which flows from the true knowledge of God, and implies that your whole soul be broad awake. And sin not - That is, and ye will not sin Sin supposes drowsiness of soul.There is need to press this. For some among you have not the knowledge of God - With all their boasted knowledge, they are totally ignorant of what it most concerns them to know. I speak this to your shame - For nothing is more shameful, than sleepy ignorance of God, and of the word and works of God; in these especially, considering the advantages they had enjoyed.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Co15_35"><b>15:35</b></a></span></td><td><span>But some one possibly will say, How are the dead raised up, after their whole frame is dissolved?

He himself made the heavens, and by descending from thence showed himself to us as the Lord.Christ was not the second man in order of time; but in this respect, that as Adam was a public person, who acted in the stead of all mankind, so was Christ. As Adam was the first general representative of men, Christ was the second and the last.
