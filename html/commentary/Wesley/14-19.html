Which he did partly by stirring up the Moabites, and others to invade him, chap. <a href="/2-chronicles/20-1.html">20:1</a> , partly by permitting his eldest son Jehoram to kill all his brethren, chap. <a href="/2-chronicles/21-4.html">21:4</a> , and principally by bringing that almost general destruction upon his grand - children by Jehu,  <a href="/2-kings/9-27.html"> 9:27</a>   <a href="/2-chronicles/19.html">2ch 19:</a> ,  <a href="/2-kings/10-13.html">10:13</a> , 14, which was the fruit of his alliance with Ahab.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Ch19_3"><b>19:3</b></a></span></td><td><span>Good things - Good marks proceeding from an honest heart; which God more regards than this particular error: and therefore though he will chasten thee, yet he will not utterly destroy thee.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Ch19_4"><b>19:4</b></a></span></td><td><span>Through - Through the whole kingdom, whereof these were the two bounds. And brought - Such of them as had revolted from God to idols, he reclaimed by his counsel and example, and by the instructions of the Levites and priests, whom he carried with him. Many, probably, had revolted to idolatry, when they saw their king so intimate with idolaters.Therefore he thought himself doubly obliged to do all he could to reduce them.
