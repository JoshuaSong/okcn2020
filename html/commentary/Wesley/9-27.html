Nor have we the least proof, that he would have sought for him again, with any other design.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Sa27_5"><b>27:5</b></a></span></td><td><span>Give me a place - A prudent desire. Hereby David designed to preserve his people, both from the vices, which conversation with the Philistines would have exposed them to; and from that envy, and malice, which diversity of religion might have caused. With thee - Which is too great an honour for me, and too burdensome to thee, and may be an occasion of offence to thy people.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Sa27_6"><b>27:6</b></a></span></td><td><span>Gave Ziklag - Not only to inhabit, but to possess it as his own.Which he did, to lay the greater obligations upon David, whom he knew so able to serve him. It was given to the tribe of Judah before,  <a href="/joshua/15-31.html"> 15:31</a> ,but the Philistines kept the possession of it 'till this time.And being given by them to David, it now belonged not to the tribe of Judah; but to the king of Judah, David and his heirs forever.To this day - This, and some such clauses seem to have been added, after the main substance of the several books was written.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Sa27_8"><b>27:8</b></a></span></td><td><span>Amalekites - The remnant of those whom Saul destroyed, chap. <a href="/1-samuel/15-3.html">15:3</a> - 9, who retired into remote and desert places.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Sa27_9"><b>27:9</b></a></span></td><td><span>Let neither man, &c. - In that part where he came: but there were more of the Amalekites yet left in another part of that land.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Sa27_10"><b>27:10</b></a></span></td><td><span>David - These and the following words are ambiguous, and contrary to that simplicity which became David, both as a prince, and as an eminent professor of the true religion. The fidelity of Achish to him, and the confidence he put in him, aggravates his sin in thus deceiving him, which David seems penitently to reflect on, when he prays, Remove from me the way of lying.</table><span><!--pageCount=1-->
