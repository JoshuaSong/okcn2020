Asked the Lord - Being assembled together at Shiloh, they enquired of the high - priest by the Urim and the Thummim. Against the Canaanites first - Finding their people multiply exceedingly, and consequently the necessity of enlarging their quarters, they renew the war. They do not enquire who shall be captain general to all the tribes; but what tribe shall first undertake the expedition, that by their success the other tribes may be encouraged to make the like attempt upon the Canaanites in their several lots.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jud1_2"><b>1:2</b></a></span></td><td><span>Judah - The tribe of Judah is chosen for the first enterprise, because they were both most populous, and so most needing enlargement; and withal most valiant, and therefore most likely to succeed: for God chooseth fit means for the work which he designs. Moreover the Canaanites were numerous and strong in those parts, and therefore to be suppressed, before they grew too strong for them.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jud1_3"><b>1:3</b></a></span></td><td><span>To Simeon - As nearest to him both by relation, being his brother by both parents, and by habitation.

For it is well known, that anciently each ruler of a city, or great town, was called a king, and had kingly power in that place; and many such kings we meet with in Canaan: and it is probable, that some years before, kings were more numerous there, 'till the greater devoured many of the less. Under my table - An act of barbarous inhumanity thus to insult over the miserable, joined with abominable luxury.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jud1_8"><b>1:8</b></a></span></td><td><span>And took - Yet some of the inhabitants retired into the castle, and held out there 'till David's time.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jud1_10"><b>1:10</b></a></span></td><td><span>Judah went - Under the conduct of Caleb, as is recorded,  <a href="/joshua/15-14.html"> 15:14</a> , &c., for that relation, and this, are doubtless oneand the same expedition, and it is mentioned there by anticipation.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jud1_16"><b>1:16</b></a></span></td><td><span>Moses's father - in - law - That is, of Jethro, so called from the people whom he descended,  <a href="/numbers/24-21.html">Numbers 24:21</a> ,22.

And the people being thus spared, did by God's just judgment recover their strength, and expel the Jews out of their cities.It is farther observable, that Ekron here taken, was one of Dan's cities, <a href="/joshua/19-43.html"> 19:43</a>, and it was taken here by Judah and Simeon, partly out of love for their brother Dan, and partly to secure their new conquests, and other adjoining territories, from such potent neighbours.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jud1_19"><b>1:19</b></a></span></td><td><span>Could not drive - Because of their unbelief, whereby they distrusted God's power to destroy those who had chariots of iron, and so gave way to their own fear and sloth, whereby God was provoked to withdraw his helping hand.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jud1_22"><b>1:22</b></a></span></td><td><span>House of Joseph - That is, the tribe of Ephraim.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jud1_24"><b>1:24</b></a></span></td><td><span>The entrance - On which side it is weakest, that we might best invade and take it.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jud1_25"><b>1:25</b></a></span></td><td><span>His family - Together with his estate, as the following verse manifests.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jud1_26"><b>1:26</b></a></span></td><td><span>The Hittites - Where the Hittites seated themselves after they were driven out of Canaan, which seems to be northward from Canaan, and near upon it.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jud1_27"><b>1:27</b></a></span></td><td><span>Manasseh - That is, that half of this tribe which dwelt in Canaan.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jud1_29"><b>1:29</b></a></span></td><td><span>In Gezer - Which they possessed 'till Solomon's time, <a href="/1-kings/9-16.html"> 9:16</a>.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jud1_34"><b>1:34</b></a></span></td><td><span>The valley - That is, into the plain country; which was the occasion of that expedition for the getting new quarters, of which we read <a href="/joshua/19-47.html"> 19:47</a>,48 and chap.<a href="/judges/18-1.html">Judges 18:1</a>- 31.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jud1_35"><b>1:35</b></a></span></td><td><span>House of Joseph - That is, of the Ephraimites, who helped their brethren the Danites against the Amorites.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jud1_36"><b>1:36</b></a></span></td><td><span>Akrabbim - Which was in the southern part of Canaan, <a href="/joshua/15-2.html"> 15:2</a>,3, from whence it went up towards the north.
