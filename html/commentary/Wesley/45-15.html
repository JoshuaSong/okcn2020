When the order is inverted, as here, the office of Christ is more solemnly considered. Was a servant - Of his Father. Of the circumcision - For the salvation of the circumcised, the Jews.

Lest I should only build upon another man's foundation - The providence of God seemed in a special manner, generally, to prevent this, though not entirely, lest the enemies of the apostle, who sought every occasion to set light by him, should have had room to say that he was behind other apostles, not being sufficient for planting of churches himself, but only for preaching where others had been already; or that he declined the more difficult part of the ministry </span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ro15_21"><b>15:21</b></a></span></td><td><span>  <a href="/isaiah/52-15.html">Isaiah 52:15</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ro15_22"><b>15:22</b></a></span></td><td><span>Therefore I have been long hindered from coming to you  - Among whom Christ had been named.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ro15_23"><b>15:23</b></a></span></td><td><span>Having no longer place in these parts - Where Christ has now been preached in every city.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ro15_24"><b>15:24</b></a></span></td><td><span>Into Spain - Where the gospel had not yet been preached.If first I may be somewhat satisfied with your company - How remarkable is the modesty with which he speaks! They might rather desire to be satisfied with his. Somewhat satisfied  - Intimating the shortness of his stay; or, perhaps, thatChrist alone can throughly satisfy the soul.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ro15_26"><b>15:26</b></a></span></td><td><span>The poor of the saints that are in Jerusalem - It can by no means be inferred from this expression, that the community of goods among the Christians was then ceased. All that can be gathered from it is, that in this time of extreme dearth,  <a href="/acts/11-28.html">Acts 11:28</a> ,29, some of the church in Jerusalem were in want;the rest being barely able to subsist themselves, but not to supply the necessities of their brethren.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ro15_27"><b>15:27</b></a></span></td><td><span>It hath pleased them; and they are their debtors - That is, they are bound to it, in justice as well as mercy.

And yet they are precious in the sight of God.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ro15_30"><b>15:30</b></a></span></td><td><span>I beseech you by the love of the Spirit - That is, by the love which is the genuine fruit of the Spirit. To strive together with me in your prayers - He must pray himself, who would have others strive together with him in prayer. Of all the apostles, St. Paul alone is recorded to desire the prayers of the faithful for himself. And this he generally does in the conclusions of his Epistles; yet not without making a difference. For he speaks in one manner to them whom he treats as his children, with the gravity or even severity of a father, such as Timothy, Titus, the Corinthians, and Galatians; in another, to them whom he treats rather like equals, such as the Romans, Ephesians, Thessalonians, Colossians, Hebrews.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ro15_31"><b>15:31</b></a></span></td><td><span>That I may be delivered - He is thus urgent from a sense of the importance of his life to the church. Otherwise he would have rejoiced "to depart, and to be with Christ." And that my service may be acceptable - In spite of all their prejudices; to the end the Jewish and gentile believers may be knit together in tender love.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ro15_32"><b>15:32</b></a></span></td><td><span>That I may come to you - This refers to the former, With joy - To the latter, part of the preceding verse.</table><span><!--pageCount=1-->
