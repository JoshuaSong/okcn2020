But many others he commanded, absolutely, to tell none of tho miracles he had wrought upon them. And this he seems to have done, chiefly for one or more of these reasons: <ol><li> To prevent the multitude from thronging him, in the manner  related  <a href="/mark/1-45.html"> 1:45</a> .<li> To fulfil the prophecy,  <a href="/isaiah/42-1.html"> 42:1</a> , that he would not be  vain or ostentatious. This reason St. Matthew assigns,   <a href="/matthew/12-17.html"> 12:17</a> , &c.<li> To avoid the being taken by force and made a king,   <a href="/john/6-15.html"> 6:15</a> . And,<li> That he might not enrage the chief priests, scribes, and  Pharisees, who were the most bitter against him, any more than  was unavoidable,  <a href="/matthew/16-20.html"> 16:20</a> ,21.</ol><p>  For a testimony - That I am the Messiah; to them - The priests,<p>  who otherwise might have pleaded want of evidence.<span><b>Chapter Overview:</B></span><blockquote><br>  <a href="/leviticus/14-2.html">Leviticus 14:2</a> .<br></span></td></tr><tr valign=top> <td align="right"><span><a name="Mt8_5"><b>8:5</b></a></span></td><td><span><br>There came to him a centurion - A captain of a hundred Roman soldiers. Probably he came a little way toward him, and then went back. He thought himself not worthy to come in person, and therefore spoke the words that follow by his messengers. As it is not unusual in all languages, so in the Hebrew it is peculiarly frequent, to ascribe to a person himself the thing which is done, and the words which are spoken by his order. And accordingly St.Matthew relates as said by the centurion himself, what others said by order from him. An instance of the same kind we have in the case of Zebedee's children. From St. Matthew,  <a href="/matthew/20-20.html">Matthew 20:20</a> , we<br> learn it was their mother that spoke those words, which,  <a href="/mark/10-35.html"> 10:35</a> ,37, themselves are said to speak; because she was<br>only their mouth. Yet from ver. 13,  <a href="/matthew/8-13.html">Matthew 8:13</a> , Go thy way home, it appears he at<br>length came in person, probably on hearing that Jesus was nearer to his house than he apprehended when he sent the second message by his friends.       <a href="/luke/7-1.html"> 7:1</a> .<br> </span></td></tr><tr valign=top> <td align="right"><span><a name="Mt8_8"><b>8:8</b></a></span></td><td><span><br>The centurion answered - By his second messengers.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top> <td align="right"><span><a name="Mt8_9"><b>8:9</b></a></span></td><td><span><br>For I am a man under authority - I am only an inferior officer: and what I command, is done even in my absence: how much more what thou commandest, who art Lord of all!</span></td></tr><tr valign=top> <td align="right"><span><a name="Mt8_10"><b>8:10</b></a></span></td><td><span><br>I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel - For the centurion was not an Israelite.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top> <td align="right"><span><a name="Mt8_11"><b>8:11</b></a></span></td><td><span><br>Many from the farthest parts of the earth shall embrace the terms and enjoy the rewards of the Gospel covenant established with Abraham.

The evangelist here onlyalludes to those words, as being capable of this lower meaning also. Such instances are frequent in the sacred writings, and are elegancies rather than imperfections. He fulfilled these words in the highest sense, by bearing our sins in his own body on the tree: in a lower sense, by sympathizing with us in our sorrows, and healing us of the diseases which were the fruit of sin.          <a href="/isaiah/53-4.html"> 53:4</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt8_18"><b>8:18</b></a></span></td><td><span>He commanded to go to the other side - That both himself and the people might have a little rest.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt8_19"><b>8:19</b></a></span></td><td><span>  <a href="/luke/9-57.html"> 9:57</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt8_20"><b>8:20</b></a></span></td><td><span>The Son of man - The expression is borrowed from  <a href="/daniel/7-13.html"> 7:13</a> , and is the appellation which Christ generallygives himself: which he seems to do out of humility, as having some relation to his mean appearance in this world.

Hence the country between them took its name, sometimes from the one, sometimes from the other. There met him two demoniacs - St. Mark and St.Luke mention only one, who was probably the fiercer of the two, and the person who spoke to our Lord first. But this is no way inconsistent with the account which St. Matthew gives. The tombs - Doubtless those malevolent spirits love such tokens of death and destruction. Tombs were usually in those days in desert places, at a distance from towns, and were often made in the sides of caves, in the rocks and mountains. No one could pass - Safely.  <a href="/mark/5-1.html"> 5:1</a> ; Luke 8:26.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt8_29"><b>8:29</b></a></span></td><td><span>What have we to do with thee - This is a Hebrew phrase, which signifies.
