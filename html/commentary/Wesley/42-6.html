This immediately preceded pentecost, which was the fiftieth day after the second day of unleavened bread.  <a href="/matthew/12-1.html">Matthew 12:1</a> ; Mr 2:23.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Lu6_2"><b>6:2</b></a></span></td><td><span>Why do ye - St. Matthew and Mark represent the Pharisees as proposing the question to our Lord himself.

He here again pronounces the poor and the hungry, themourners, and the persecuted, happy; and represents as miserable those who are rich, and full, and joyous, and applauded: because generally prosperity is a sweet poison, and affliction a healing, though bitter medicine. Let the thought reconcile us to adversity, and awaken our caution when the world smiles upon us; when a plentiful table is spread before us, and our cup is running over; when our spirits are gay; and we hear (what nature loves) our own praise from men.Happy are ye poor - The word seems here to be taken literally: ye who have left al] for me.  <a href="/matthew/5-3.html">Matthew 5:3</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Lu6_24"><b>6:24</b></a></span></td><td><span>Miserable are ye rich - If ye have received or sought your consolation or happiness therein.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Lu6_25"><b>6:25</b></a></span></td><td><span>Full - Of meat and drink, and worldly goods.That laugh - That are of a light trifling spirit.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Lu6_26"><b>6:26</b></a></span></td><td><span>Wo to you when all men shall speak well of you - But who will believe this?</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Lu6_27"><b>6:27</b></a></span></td><td><span>But I say to you that hear - Hitherto our Lord had spoken only to particular sorts of persons: now he begins speaking to all in general.            <a href="/matthew/5-44.html">Matthew 5:44</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Lu6_29"><b>6:29</b></a></span></td><td><span>To him that smiteth thee on the cheek - Taketh away thy cloak  - These seem to be proverbial expressions, to signify an invasionof the tenderest points of honour and property.

It is for this reason he uses this parable, Can the blind lead the blind? - Can the scribes teach this way, which they know not themselves? Will not they and their scholars perish together? Can they make their disciples any better than themselves? But as for those who will be my disciples, they shall be all taught of God; who will enable them to come to the measure of the stature of the fulness of their Master.
