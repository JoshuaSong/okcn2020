When we are under the rebukes of God's providence, it is good for us to enquire, Whether we have not neglected God's ordinances, and whether that be not the controversy he has with us?</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Ch29_9"><b>29:9</b></a></span></td><td><span>Captivity - Tho' they were presently released, chap. <a href="/2-chronicles/28-5.html">28:5</a> ,14,15.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Ch29_11"><b>29:11</b></a></span></td><td><span>Sons - So he calls them, though many of them were elder than himself, because he was by his tender love and affection, as he was by his office obliged to be, a nursing father to them.

Kingdom - To make atonement for the sins of the king and the royal family, and the court. Sanctuary - For all the idolatry and uncleanness wherewith the temple had been polluted. They thought it not enough to lament and forsake their sins, but they brought a sin - offering.Even our repentance and reformation will not obtain pardon, but thro' Christ, who was made sin, that is, a sin - offering for us.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Ch29_23"><b>29:23</b></a></span></td><td><span>They laid - The king and the elders of the congregation in the name of the whole congregation.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Ch29_27"><b>29:27</b></a></span></td><td><span>The song - The psalms composed by David and Asaph.Even sorrow for sin must not put us out of tune for praising God.By faith we must even then rejoice in the Lord our righteousness, and our prayers and praises must attend with his offering, to be accepted only in the virtue of it.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Ch29_31"><b>29:31</b></a></span></td><td><span>Consecrated - Now that you have reconciled yourselves and the house to God, and that he is willing and ready to accept your sacrifices.Burnt - offerings - Wherein there was more generosity than in the other sacrifices, because they were wholly burnt and offered to God.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Ch29_33"><b>29:33</b></a></span></td><td><span>Consecrated things - All the offerings consecrated to God, besides the burnt - offerings already mentioned.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Ch29_34"><b>29:34</b></a></span></td><td><span>Too few - Such as were sanctified and fit for their work, as the following words shew: for otherwise the number of the priests was more than sufficient for this employment.
