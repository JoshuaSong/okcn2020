		<span><span><center><b>The Book of Galatians<br>Chapter 6</b></center></span><span><b>Verses:</B></span><br><TABLE WIDTH="100%" CELLPADDING="4" CELLSPACING="0" BORDER="0"><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ga6_1"><b>6:1</b></a></span></td><td><span>Brethren, if a man be overtaken in any fault - By surprise, ignorance, or stress of temptation. Ye who are spiritual - Who continue to live and walk by the Spirit. Restore such an one - By reproof, instruction, or exhortation. Every one who can, ought to help herein; only in the spirit of meekness - This is essential to a spiritual man; and in this lies the whole force of the cure. Considering thyself - The plural is beautifully changed into the singular. Let each take heed to himself.Lest thou also be tempted - Temptation easily and swiftly passes from one to another; especially if a man endeavours to cure another without preserving his own meekness.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ga6_2"><b>6:2</b></a></span></td><td><span>Bear ye one another's burdens - Sympathize with, and assist, each other, in all your weaknesses, grievances, trials. And so fulfil the law of Christ - The law of Christ (an uncommon expression) is the law of love: this our Lord peculiarly recommends; this he makes the distinguishing mark of his disciples.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ga6_3"><b>6:3</b></a></span></td><td><span>If any one think himself to be something - Above his brethren, or by any strength of his own. When he is nothing, he deceiveth himself - He alone will bear their burdens, who knows himself to be nothing.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ga6_4"><b>6:4</b></a></span></td><td><span>But let every man try his own work - Narrowly examine all he is, and all he doeth. And then he shall have rejoicing in himself - He will find in himself matter of rejoicing, if his works are right before God.And not in another - Not in glorying over others.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ga6_5"><b>6:5</b></a></span></td><td><span>For every one shall bear his own burden - ln that day shall give an account of himself to God.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ga6_6"><b>6:6</b></a></span></td><td><span>Let him that is taught impart to him that teacheth all such temporal good things as he stands in need of.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ga6_7"><b>6:7</b></a></span></td><td><span>God is not mocked - Although they attempt to mock him, who think to reap otherwise than they sow.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ga6_8"><b>6:8</b></a></span></td><td><span>For he that now soweth to the flesh - That follows the desires of corrupt nature. Shall hereafter of the flesh - Out of this very seed.Reap corruption - Death everlasting. But he that soweth to the Spirit  - That follows his guidance in all his tempers and conversation. Shall ofthe Spirit - By the free grace and power of God, reap life everlasting.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ga6_9"><b>6:9</b></a></span></td><td><span>But let us not be weary in well doing - Let us persevere in sowing to the Spirit. For in due season - When the harvest is come, we shall reap, if we faint not.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ga6_10"><b>6:10</b></a></span></td><td><span>Therefore as we have opportunity - At whatever time or place, and in whatever manner we can. The opportunity in general is our lifetime; but there are also many particular opportunities. Satan is quickened in doing hurt, by the shortness of the time,  <a href="/revelation/12-12.html">Revelation 12:12</a> .By the same consideration let us be quickened in doing good.Let us do good - In every possible kind, and in every possible degree.Unto all men - Neighbours or strangers, good or evil, friends or enemies.But especially to them who are of the household of faith.For all believers are but one family.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ga6_11"><b>6:11</b></a></span></td><td><span>Ye see how large a letter - St. Paul had not yet wrote a larger to any church. I have written with my own hand - He generally wrote by an amanuensis.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ga6_12"><b>6:12</b></a></span></td><td><span>As many as desire to make a fair appearance in the flesh - To preserve a fair character. These constrain you - Both by their example and importunity. To be circumcised - Not so much from a principle of conscience, as lest they should suffer persecution - From the unbelieving Jews. For the cross of Christ - For maintaining that faith in a crucified Saviour is alone sufficient for justification.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ga6_13"><b>6:13</b></a></span></td><td><span>For neither they themselves keep the whole law - So far are they from a real zeal for it. But yet they desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh - That they may boast of you as their proselytes, and make a merit of this with the other Jews.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ga6_14"><b>6:14</b></a></span></td><td><span>But God forbid that I should glory - Should boast of anything I have, am, or do; or rely on anything for my acceptance with God, but what Christ hath done and suffered for me. By means of which the world is crucified to me - All the things and persons in it are to me as nothing. And I unto the world - I am dead to all worldly pursuits, cares, desires, and enjoyments.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ga6_15"><b>6:15</b></a></span></td><td><span>For neither circumcision is anything, nor uncircumcision - Neither of these is of any account. But a new creation - Whereby all things in us become new.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ga6_16"><b>6:16</b></a></span></td><td><span>And as many as walk according to this rule - <ol> <li> Glorying only in the cross of Christ. <li> Being crucified to the world. And, <li> Created anew.</ol>Peace and mercy be upon them, and upon the Israel, that is, the Church, of God - Which consists of all those, and those only, of every nation and kindred, who walk by this rule.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ga6_17"><b>6:17</b></a></span></td><td><span>From henceforth let none trouble me - By quarrels and disputes.For I bear - And afflictions should not be added to the afflicted.In my body the marks of the Lord Jesus - The scars, marks, and brands of my sufferings for Him.</table><!--pageCount=1-->
