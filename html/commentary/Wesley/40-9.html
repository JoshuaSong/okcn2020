Another is, they are not ripe for it.

Flutes were used especially on the death of children; louder instruments on the death of grown persons.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt9_24"><b>9:24</b></a></span></td><td><span>Withdraw - There is no need of you now; for the maid is not dead - Her life is not at an end; but sleepeth - This is only a temporary suspension of sense and motion, which should rather be termed sleep than death.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt9_25"><b>9:25</b></a></span></td><td><span>The maid arose - Christ raised three dead persons to life; this child, the widow's son, and Lazarus: one newly departed, another on the bier, the third smelling in the grave: to show us that no degree of death is so desperate as to be past his help.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt9_32"><b>9:32</b></a></span></td><td><span>  <a href="/luke/11-14.html"> 11:14</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt9_33"><b>9:33</b></a></span></td><td><span>Even in Israel - Where so many wonders have been seen.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt9_36"><b>9:36</b></a></span></td><td><span>Because they were faint - In soul rather than in body. As sheep having no shepherd - And yet they had many teachers; they had scribes in every city. But they had none who cared for their souls, and none that were able, if they had been willing, to have wrought any deliverance. They had no pastors after God's own heart.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Mt9_37"><b>9:37</b></a></span></td><td><span>The harvest truly is great - When Christ came into the world, it was properly the time of harvest; till then it was the seed time only.

Those who never felt this, never yet knew what it is to be labourers in Christ's harvest. He sends them forth, when he calls them by his Spirit, furnishes them with grace and gifts for the work, and makes a way for them to be employed therein.</table><span><!--pageCount=1-->
