Each part</p><p>  consists of eight verses. All the verses of the first part beginning</p><p>  with Aleph, all the verses of the second with Beth, and so on.</p><p>  It is observable, that the word of God is here called by the names of</p><p>  law, statutes, precepts or commandments, judgments, ordinances,</p><p>  righteousness, testimonies, way and word. By which variety, he</p><p>  designed to express the nature and perfection of God's word. It is</p><p>  called his word, as revealed by him to us; his way, as</p><p>  prescribed by him for us to walk in; his law, as binding us to</p><p>  obedience; his statutes, as declaring his authority of giving us</p><p>  laws; his precepts as directing our duty; his ordinances, as</p><p>  ordained by him; his righteousness, as exactly agreeable to God's</p><p>  righteous nature and will; his judgments, as proceeding from the</p><p>  great judge of the world, and being his judicial sentence to which all</p><p>  men must submit; and his testimonies, as it contains the witness of</p><p>  God's will, and of man's duty. And there is but one of these one</p><p>  hundred and seventy six verses, in which one or other of these titles</p><p>  is not found. The general scope and design of this psalm is, to</p><p>  magnify the law and make it honourable: to shew the excellency and</p><p>  usefulness of divine revelation, and recommend it to us, by the</p><p>  psalmist's own example, who speaks by experience of the benefits of it,</p><p>  for which he praises God, and earnestly prays for the continuance of</p><p>  God's grace, to direct and quicken him in his way.</td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><a name="Ps89_6"><b>89:6</b></a></td><td>Respect - A due respect, which implies hearty affection, diligent study, and constant practice.
