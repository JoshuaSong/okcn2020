He, in the name of the Jews, complains of the miseries they suffered,  ver. 1 - 11.<br>  Encourages himself by recollecting the mighty works of God, ver. 12 - 17.<br>  Prays for deliverance, ver. 18 - 23.<br>  Maschil of Asaph <br>&nbsp;<br>Title of the psalm. Maschil of Asaph - Not composed by that famous Asaph, who flourished in David's time, but by some of his posterity, who is called by their father's name, as this psalm speaks of the destruction of the temple and of Jerusalem, and of God's people by the Chaldeans.</BLOCKQUOTE><span><b>Verses:</B></span><br><TABLE WIDTH="100%" CELLPADDING="4" CELLSPACING="0" BORDER="0"><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ps74_2"><b>74:2</b></a></span></td><td><span>Thy congregation - Thy people.
