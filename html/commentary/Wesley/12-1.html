But when the kingdoms of Israel and Judah were weak and forsaken by God, they took that opportunity to revolt from them; Moab here, and Edom a little after.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Ki1_2"><b>1:2</b></a></span></td><td><span>Chamber - In which, the lattess might be left to convey light into the lower room. But the words may be rendered, through the battlements (or through the lattess in the battlements) of the roof of the house.Where, standing and looking through, and leaning upon this lattess, it broke, and he fell down into the court or garden. Baal - zebub - Properly, the god of flies; an idol so called, because it was supposed to deliver those people from flies; Jupiter and Hercules were called by a like name among the Grecians. And it is evident, both from sacred and prophane histories, That the idol - gods, did sometimes through God's permission, give the answers; though they were generally observed, even by the Heathens themselves, to be dark and doubtful.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Ki1_3"><b>1:3</b></a></span></td><td><span>And say - Dost thou not cast contempt on the God of Israel, as if he were either ignorant of the event of thy disease, or unable to give thee relief; and as if Baal - zebub had more skill and power than he?</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Ki1_5"><b>1:5</b></a></span></td><td><span>Why, &c. - Before you have been at Ekron: which he knew by their quick return.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Ki1_8"><b>1:8</b></a></span></td><td><span>An hairy man - His garment was rough and hairy, such as were worn by eminent persons in Greece, in ancient times; and were the proper habit of the prophets. Girdle - As John the baptist also had.That by his very outward habit, he might represent Elijah, in whose spirit and power he came.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Ki1_9"><b>1:9</b></a></span></td><td><span>Man of God - So he calls him by way of scorn. Come - The king commands thee to come to him: which if thou refuseth, I am to carry thee by force.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Ki1_10"><b>1:10</b></a></span></td><td><span>Let fire, &c. - Elijah did this, not to secure himself, he could have done that some other way: nor to revenge himself, for it was not his own cause that he acted in: but to prove his mission, and to reveal the wrath of God from heaven against the ungodliness and unrighteousness of men.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Ki1_11"><b>1:11</b></a></span></td><td><span>And said - He discovers more petulancy than the former; and shews, how little he was moved by the former example.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Ki1_13"><b>1:13</b></a></span></td><td><span>Besought - Expressing both reverence to his person, and a dread of God's judgments.

Nor durst the king lay hands upon him, being daunted with the prophet's presence, and confidence; and affrighted by the late dreadful evidence of his power with God.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Ki1_17"><b>1:17</b></a></span></td><td><span>Jehoram - His brother.The son of Jehoshaphat - Jehoshaphat, in his seventeenth year, when he went to Ahab, and with him to Ramoth - Gilead, appointed his son Jehoram his vice - roy, and (in case of his death) his successor. In the second year from that time, when Jehoram was thus made vice - king in his father's stead; this Jehoram, Ahab's son, began to reign: and in the fifth year of the reign of this Jehoram son of Ahab, which was about the twenty - fourth year of Jehoshaphat's reign, Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat was made king of Judah, together with his father.</table><span><!--pageCount=1-->
