This liberty once obtained, they knew they could worship idols without disturbance: which was the thing at which they aimed. And for the prevention of such abuses, God obliged all to worship him in one place.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Ch24_18"><b>24:18</b></a></span></td><td><span>Left, &c. - The king and princes that awhile ago so zealously repaired the temple, now forsook the temple!

That ever such a villainy should be committed, by men, by Israelites, in contempt and violation of everything that is just, honourable, and sacred! The Jews say, there were seven transgressions in one: They killed a priest, a prophet, a judge; they shed innocent blood; polluted the court of the temple, the Sabbath, and the day of expiation: for on that day, their tradition says, this happened.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Ch24_22"><b>24:22</b></a></span></td><td><span>Require it - Make inquisition for innocent blood.
