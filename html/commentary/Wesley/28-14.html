Mercy - Both the fountain and streams of goodness too, free grace, and rich bounty.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ho14_5"><b>14:5</b></a></span></td><td><span>As the dew - I will refresh and comfort, and make fruitful in good works, such as return to me.

The scent thereof - The savour of it to God and good men shall be pleasing as the scent of the delicious wines of Lebanon.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ho14_8"><b>14:8</b></a></span></td><td><span>I have heard him - A gracious promise from God of hearing prayers.A green fir - tree - As a weary traveller finds rest and safety under a thick tree, so there is safety and refreshment under the protection of the Lord.From me - Of God alone.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ho14_9"><b>14:9</b></a></span></td><td><span>Shall understand - Which the prophet has delivered.The ways - The ways which he would have us walk in towards him, his law, his ordinances, his whole doctrine are all righteous and equal. And the ways wherein God walks towards us, in afflicting or comforting are all righteous and equal. Shall walk in them - Will approve them all, justifying the righteousness of God's displeasure, and confessing he remembereth mercy in the midst of judgment. And justifying the righteousness of his precepts by endeavouring to observe them.The transgressors - Wilful, obstinate sinners, stumble and are offended at his commands, but more at his judgments; they cast off the one, and vainly hope to shift off the other, 'till at last they fall under the weight of their own sins and God's wrath.</table><!--pageCount=1-->
