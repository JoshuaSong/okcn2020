As for Mephibosheth, he was very young and obscure, and possibly concealed by his friends, lest David should cut him off, as hath been usual among princes.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Sa9_5"><b>9:5</b></a></span></td><td><span>Machir - This Machir appears to have been a generous man, who entertained Mephibosheth out of mere compassion, not of disaffection to David: for afterwards we find him kind to David himself, when he fled from Absalom. David now little thought, that the time would come, when he himself should need his assistance. Let us be forward to give, because we know not what we ourselves may sometime want.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Sa9_8"><b>9:8</b></a></span></td><td><span>Bowed himself - It is good to have the heart humbled under humbling providences. If when divine providence brings our condition down, divine grace brings our spirits down, we shall be easy.</table><span><!--pageCount=1-->
