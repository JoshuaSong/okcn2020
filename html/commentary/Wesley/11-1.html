No heat - Which is not strange in a person who had been exercised with so many hardships inwar, and with such tormenting cares, and fears, and sorrows, for his own sins(as divers of his Psalms witness) and for the sins and miseries of hischildren and people. Besides, this might be from the nature of his bodilydistemper.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Ki1_2"><b>1:2</b></a></span></td><td><span>Servants - His physicians. Virgin - Whose natural heat is fresh and wholesome, and not impaired with bearing or breeding of children.The same counsel doth Galen give for the cure of some cold and drydistempers. Stand - That is, minister unto him, or wait upon him, in hissickness, as occasion requires. Lie in his bosom - As his wife: for thatshe was so, may appear by divers arguments. First, otherwise this had beena wicked course; which therefore neither his servants durst have prescribed,nor would David have used, especially being now in a dying condition.Secondly, it appears from this phrase of lying in his bosom, which iseverywhere in scripture mentioned as the privilege of a wife. Thirdly,this made Adonijah's crime in desiring her to wife, so heinous inSolomon's account, because he saw, that by marrying the king's wife hedesigned to revive his pretence to the kingdom.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Ki1_4"><b>1:4</b></a></span></td><td><span>Knew her not - Which is mentioned to note the continuance and progress of the king's malady.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Ki1_5"><b>1:5</b></a></span></td><td><span>Then - Upon notice of the desperateness of the king's disease, and the approach of his death.

Gihon - A river near Jerusalem,on the west side. Adonijah was inaugurated on the east side. Thisplace David chose, either, as remote from Adonijah and his company,that so the people might be there without fear of tumults or bloodshed; or,to shew that Solomon was chosen king in opposition to Adonijah: or,because this was a place of great resort, and fit to receive and displaythat numerous company, which he knew would follow Solomon thither.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Ki1_34"><b>1:34</b></a></span></td><td><span>Anoint - As they used to do where there was any thing new or extraordinary in the succession.
