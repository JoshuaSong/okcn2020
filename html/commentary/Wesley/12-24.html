He could not now come to protect the king of Judah, being scarce able to defend his own kingdom.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Ki24_8"><b>24:8</b></a></span></td><td><span>To reign - In his eighth year he began to reign with his father, who made him king with him as divers other kings of Israel and Judah had done in times of trouble; and in his eighteenth year he reigned alone.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Ki24_12"><b>24:12</b></a></span></td><td><span>Went out - Yielded up himself and the city into his hands; and this by the counsel of Jeremiah, and to his own good.His reign - Of Nebuchadnezzar's reign; as appears by comparing this with chap. <a href="/2-kings/25-8.html">25:8</a> , and because Jehoiachin reigned not half a year. Had he made his peace with God, and taken the method that Hezekiah did in the like case, he needed not to have feared the king of Babylon, but might have held out with courage, honour and success. But wanting the faith and piety of an Israelite, he had not the resolution of a man.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Ki24_13"><b>24:13</b></a></span></td><td><span>Vessels - The most and choicest of them, by comparing this with chap. <a href="/2-kings/25-14.html">25:14</a> ,15.Solomon made - Though the city and temple had been rifled more than once both by the kings of Egypt and Israel, and by the wicked kings of Judah; yet these golden vessels were preserved from them, either by the case of the priests, who hid them; or by the clemency of the conquerors, or by the special providence of God, disposing their hearts to leave them.Or, if they had been taken away by any of these kings, they might afterwards be recovered good, at the cost of the kings of Judah.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Ki24_14"><b>24:14</b></a></span></td><td><span>All - Not simply all, but the best and most considerable part, as the following words explain it.
