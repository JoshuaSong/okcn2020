Aboundeth - Like water that overflows its banks, and yet increaseth still.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Th1_4"><b>1:4</b></a></span></td><td><span>Which ye endure - "That ye may be accounted worthy of the kingdom." </span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Th1_5"><b>1:5</b></a></span></td><td><span>A manifest token - This is treated of in the sixth  <a href="/2-thessalonians/1-6.html">2&nbsp;Thessalonians 1:6</a> <a href="default.aspx?reference=and"> </a>, <a href="default.aspx?reference=following"> </a>, <a href="default.aspx?reference=verses"> </a>, .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Th1_6"><b>1:6</b></a></span></td><td><span>It is a righteous thing with God - (However men may judge) to transfer the pressure from you to them. And it is remarkable that about this time, at the passover, the Jews raising a tumult, a great number (some say thirty thousand) of them were slain. St. Paul seems to allude to this beginning of sorrows, <a href="/1-thessalonians/2-16.html">1&nbsp;Thessalonians 2:16</a>, which did not end but with their destruction.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Th1_8"><b>1:8</b></a></span></td><td><span>Taking vengeance - Does God barely permit this, or (as "the Lord" once "rained brimstone and fire from the Lord outof heaven," <a href="/genesis/19-24.html">Genesis 19:24</a>) does a fiery stream go forth from him for ever? Who know not God - (The root of all wickedness and misery) who remain in heathen ignorance. And who obey not - This refers chiefly to the Jews, who had heard the gospel.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Th1_9"><b>1:9</b></a></span></td><td><span>From the glory of his power - Tremble, ye stout - hearted.Everlasting destruction - As there can be no end of their sins, (the same enmity against God continuing,) so neither of theirpunishment; sin and its punishment running parallel throughout eternity itself. They must of necessity, therefore, be cut off from all good, and all possibility of it. From the presence of the Lord - Wherein chiefly consists the salvation of the righteous. What unspeakable punishment is implied even in falling short of this, supposing that nothing more were implied in his taking vengeance!</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Th1_10"><b>1:10</b></a></span></td><td><span>To be glorified in his saints - For the wonderful glory of Christ shall shine in them.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Th1_11"><b>1:11</b></a></span></td><td><span>All the good pleasure of his goodness - Which is no less than perfect holiness.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="2Th1_12"><b>1:12</b></a></span></td><td><span>That the name - The love and power of our Lord may be glorified - Gloriously displayed in you.</table><span><!--pageCount=1-->
