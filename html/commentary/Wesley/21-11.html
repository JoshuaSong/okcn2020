Find it - It shall certainly be restored to thee, either by God or men. This is added to prevent an objection, and to quicken us to the duty enjoyned. After - The return may be slow, but it is sure, and will be so much the more plentiful.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ec11_2"><b>11:2</b></a></span></td><td><span>Give - A part of thy estate or provisions.
