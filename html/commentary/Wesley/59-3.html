Knowing that we - That all who thrust themselves into the office. Shall receive greater condemnation - For more offences. St. James here, as in several of the following verses, by a common figure of speech, includes himself: we shall receive,  - we offend, - we put bits, - we curse - None of which, as commonsense shows, are to be interpreted either of him or of the other apostles.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jas3_2"><b>3:2</b></a></span></td><td><span>The same is able to bridle the whole body - That is, the whole man. And doubtless some are able to do this, and so are in this sense perfect.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jas3_3"><b>3:3</b></a></span></td><td><span>We - That is, men.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jas3_5"><b>3:5</b></a></span></td><td><span>Boasteth great things - Hath great influence.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jas3_6"><b>3:6</b></a></span></td><td><span>A world of iniquity - Containing an immense quantity of all manner of wickedness. It defileth - As fire by its smoke.The whole body - The whole man. And setteth on fire the course of nature - All the passions, every wheel of his soul.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jas3_7"><b>3:7</b></a></span></td><td><span>Every kind - The expression perhaps is not to be taken strictly. Reptiles - That is, creeping things.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jas3_8"><b>3:8</b></a></span></td><td><span>But no man can tame the tongue - Of another; no, nor his own, without peculiar help from God.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jas3_9"><b>3:9</b></a></span></td><td><span>Men made after the likeness of God - Indeed we have now lost this likeness; yet there remains from thence an indelible nobleness, which we ought to reverence both in ourselves and others.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jas3_13"><b>3:13</b></a></span></td><td><span>Let him show his wisdom as well as his faith by his works; not by words only.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jas3_14"><b>3:14</b></a></span></td><td><span>If ye have bitter zeal - True Christian zeal is only the flame of love. Even in your hearts - Though it went no farther. Do not lie against the truth - As if such zeal could consist with heavenly wisdom.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jas3_15"><b>3:15</b></a></span></td><td><span>This wisdom - Which is consistent with such zeal.Is earthly - Not heavenly; not from the Father of Lights.Animal - Not spiritual; not from the Spirit of God.Devilish - Not the gift of Christ, but such as Satan breathes into the soul.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jas3_17"><b>3:17</b></a></span></td><td><span>But the wisdom from above is first pure - From all that is earthly, natural, devilish. Then peaceable - True peace attending purity, it is quiet, inoffensive. Gentle - Soft, mild, yielding, not rigid. Easy to he entreated - To be persuaded, or convinced; not stubborn, sour, or morose. Full of good fruits - Both in the heart and in the life, two of which are immediately specified. Without partiality - Loving all, without respect of persons; embracing all good things, rejecting all evil. And without dissimulation - Frank, open.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jas3_18"><b>3:18</b></a></span></td><td><span>And the principle productive of this righteousness is sown, like good seed, in the peace of a believer's mind, and brings forth a plentiful harvest of happiness, (which is the proper fruit of righteousness,) for them that make peace - That labour to promote this pure and holy peace among all men.</table><span><!--pageCount=1-->
