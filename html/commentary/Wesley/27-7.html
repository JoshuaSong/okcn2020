In this chapter we have,  The vision of the four beasts, ver. 1 - 8.<br>  The vision of God's throne of government and judgment, ver. 9 - 14.<br>  The interpretation of those visions, ver. 15 - 28.<br></BLOCKQUOTE><span><b>Verses:</B></span><br><TABLE WIDTH="100%" CELLPADDING="4" CELLSPACING="0" BORDER="0"><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Da7_1"><b>7:1</b></a></span></td><td><span>In the first year of Belshazzar - This prophecy is written in Chaldee, to be a monument to him, of the reverence his father and grandfather shewed towards God, who had done such mighty works for them.Then he wrote - These visions were recorded for the benefit of the church, to rectify their mistake: for they thought all things would succeed prosperously after they returned out of their captivity.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Da7_2"><b>7:2</b></a></span></td><td><span>The four winds - Probably by the four winds of the great sea is signified commotions of contrary nations, striving together by wars, and producing these four beasts successively.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Da7_3"><b>7:3</b></a></span></td><td><span>Four great beasts - That is, four great monarchies, great, in comparison of particular kingdoms; beasts for their tyrannical oppressions.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Da7_4"><b>7:4</b></a></span></td><td><span>The first - This was the Chaldean, or Assyrian; whose seat was first at Babylon, afterwards at Nineveh, and then at Babylon again. Eagle's wings - They were swift, over - running many countries, and brought their monarchy to a prodigious height in a short time.The wings were plucked - Which was first done in stopping the career of their victories, and afterwards in casting them out of their kingdom.A man's heart - They lost their lion - like courage, and became faint and cowardly like other men.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Da7_5"><b>7:5</b></a></span></td><td><span>Another beast - The Mede's and Persians, a fierce, ravenous creature.
