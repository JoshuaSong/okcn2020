But the temple was not finished till the eighth month,chap. <a href="/1-kings/6-38.html">6:38</a> , how then could he invite them in the seventh month? Thiswas the seventh month of the next year. For although the house in allits parts was finished the year before, yet the utensils of it were notthen fully finished: and many preparations were to be made for this greatand extraordinary occasion.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Ki8_3"><b>8:3</b></a></span></td><td><span>The priests - For although the Levites might do this,  <a href="/numbers/4-15.html">Numbers 4:15</a> , yet the priests did it at this time, for the greaterhonour of the solemnity; and because the Levites might not enter intothe holy - place, much less into the holy of holies, where it was to beplaced, into which the priests themselves might not have entered, if thehigh - priest alone could have done it.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Ki8_4"><b>8:4</b></a></span></td><td><span>The tabernacle - That made by Moses, which doubtless before this time had been translated from Gibeon to Zion, and now togetherwith other things, was put into the treasuries of the Lord's house, toprevent all superstitious use of it, and to oblige the people to come upto Jerusalem, as the only place where God would now be worshipped.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Ki8_5"><b>8:5</b></a></span></td><td><span>Sacrificing - When the ark was seated in its place: for although they might in the way offer some sacrifices, as David did; yet that wasnot a proper season to offer so many sacrifices as could not be numbered.This is more particularly related below, ver.  <a href="/1-kings/8-62.html">62</a> ,63,64, which is heresignified by way of anticipation.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Ki8_6"><b>8:6</b></a></span></td><td><span>Cherubim - Of Solomon's new made cherubim, not of the Mosaic cherubim, which were far less, and unmovably fixed to the ark, <a href="/exodus/37-7.html">Exodus 37:7</a> ,8, and therefore together with the ark, were put underthe wings of these cherubim.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Ki8_8"><b>8:8</b></a></span></td><td><span>Drew out - Not wholly, which was expressly forbidden,  <a href="/exodus/25-15.html">Exodus 25:15</a> , Nu 4:6, but in part.Seen out - In the most holy place, which is oft called by way of eminency,the holy place, and the Hebrew words rendered before the oracle,may be as well rendered, within the oracle.

Hence the Heathens used to swear at their altars.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Ki8_32"><b>8:32</b></a></span></td><td><span>His way - The just recompence of his wicked action.Give him, &c. - To vindicate him, and manifest his integrity.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Ki8_33"><b>8:33</b></a></span></td><td><span>Confess - Give glory to thy name, by acknowledging their sins, and by justice; and by accepting the punishment of their iniquity; and bytrusting to thy power and goodness alone, for their deliverance.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Ki8_35"><b>8:35</b></a></span></td><td><span>Heaven - The lower heaven in which the clouds are.Shut up - Heaven is compared to a great store - house in God's keeping,out of which nothing can be had, so long as it is close shut up.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Ki8_36"><b>8:36</b></a></span></td><td><span>Good way - The way, of their duty, which is good in itself; and both delightful and profitable, to those that walk in it. Give rain - Theorder of Solomon's prayer is very observable; first and chiefly, heprays for their repentance and forgiveness, which is the chief blessing,and the only solid foundation of all other mercies: and then he prays fortemporal mercies; thereby teaching us what to desire principally in ourprayers; which also Christ hath taught us in his perfect prayer; whereinthere is but one petition for outward, and all the rest are for spiritualblessings.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Ki8_38"><b>8:38</b></a></span></td><td><span>The plague - His sin, which may be called the plague of his heart, in opposition to the other plagues here mentioned; so the senseis, who, by their afflictions are brought to a true and serious sense oftheir worse and inward plague of their sins, which are most fitly calledthe plague of the heart, because that is both the principal seat of sin,and the fountain from whence all actual sins flow.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Ki8_39"><b>8:39</b></a></span></td><td><span>Thou knowest - Not only the plagues of their hearts, their several wants and burdens, (these he knows! but he will know them from us,)but the desire and intent of the heart, the sincerity or hypocrisy of it.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Ki8_41"><b>8:41</b></a></span></td><td><span>A stranger - A proselyte.

It is observable, that his prayer for the strangers is more large, and comprehensive, than forthe Israelites; that thereby he might both shew his public - spiritedness,and encourage strangers to the worship of the true God. Thus early were theindications of God's favour, toward the sinners of the Gentiles.As there was then one law for the native and for the stranger, so therewas one gospel for both.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Ki8_44"><b>8:44</b></a></span></td><td><span>To battle - In a just cause, and by thy warrant or commission.Shall pray - Whereby he instructs them, that they should not trust, eitherto the strength or justice of their arms, but only to God's help andblessing.

Soldiers in the field must not think itenough that others pray for them: they must pray for themselves. And theyare here encouraged to expect a gracious answer. Praying should always goalong with fighting.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Ki8_48"><b>8:48</b></a></span></td><td><span>And return - Sincerely, universally, and steadfastly.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Ki8_49"><b>8:49</b></a></span></td><td><span>Their course - Heb. their right, against their invaders and oppressors.

Never were wordsmore pertinently spoken: never was a congregation dismissed, with thatwhich was more likely to affect them, and to abide with them.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Ki8_56"><b>8:56</b></a></span></td><td><span>Blessed, &c. - This discharge he gives in the name of all Israel, to the everlasting honour of the Divine faithfulness, and theeverlasting encouragement of all those that build upon the Divine promises.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Ki8_58"><b>8:58</b></a></span></td><td><span>Incline - That he may not only bless us with outward prosperity, but especially, with spiritual blessings: and that as he hath given us hisword to teach and direct us, so he would by his holy Spirit, effectuallyincline us to obey it.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Ki8_61"><b>8:61</b></a></span></td><td><span>Perfect - Let your obedience be universal, without dividing; upright, without dissembling; and constant, without declining.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Ki8_63"><b>8:63</b></a></span></td><td><span>Offered - Not all in one day, but in the seven, or it may be in the fourteen days, mentioned ver.  <a href="/1-kings/8-65.html">65</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Ki8_64"><b>8:64</b></a></span></td><td><span>Middle of the court - Of the priests court, in which the great altar was. This he consecrated as he did the great altar, by sacrifices;but with this difference, that he consecrated that for perpetual use: butthis only for the present occasion, being warranted to do so both by thenecessity of it for God's service, and for the present solemn work, forwhich the brazen altar was not sufficient; and by the direction of God'sspirit, wherewith Solomon was endowed, as being a prophet, as well as aking. Here therefore he suddenly reared up divers altars, which, afterthis solemnity were demolished.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Ki8_65"><b>8:65</b></a></span></td><td><span>Seven - Seven for the dedication of the temple, or altar; and the other seven for the feast of tabernacles. And it seems to be expressed inthis manner, to intimate, that these fourteen days of rejoicing, were notaltogether, but that there was some interval between them, which indeed wasnecessary, because the day of atonement was on the tenth day of this month, <a href="/leviticus/23-27.html">Leviticus 23:27</a> . And because these fourteen days ended on the twenty - secondday,  <a href="/2-chronicles/7-10.html">2&nbsp;Chronicles 7:10</a> , it may seem most probable, that the feast of thededication was kept before the tenth day: and the feast of tabernacles somedays after it.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Ki8_66"><b>8:66</b></a></span></td><td><span>He sent - Solomon having joined with the people in the solemn assembly, which was kept on the eighth day; in the close of that day tookhis solemn farewell, and dismissed them with his blessing; and the nextmorning when the heads and elders with divers of the people came to taketheir leave of the king, he sent them away.</table><span><!--pageCount=1-->
