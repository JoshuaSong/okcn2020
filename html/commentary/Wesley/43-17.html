This chapter contains the easiest words, and the deepest sense of any in all the Scripture: yet is here no incoherent rhapsody, but the whole is closely and exactly connected.</BLOCKQUOTE><span><b>Verses:</B></span><br><TABLE WIDTH="100%" CELLPADDING="4" CELLSPACING="0" BORDER="0"><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Joh17_1"><b>17:1</b></a></span></td><td><span>Father - This simplicity of appellation highly became the only - begotten Son of God; to which a believer then makes the nearest approach, when he is fullest of love and humble confidence.The hour is come - The appointed time for it; glorify thy Son - The Son glorified the Father, both before and after his own glorification.When he speaks to the Father he does not style himself the Son of man.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Joh17_2"><b>17:2</b></a></span></td><td><span>As thou hast given him power over all flesh - This answers to glorify thy Son. That he may give eternal life, &c. - This answers to that thy Son may glorify thee. To all whom thou hast given him  - To all believers. This is a clear proof that Christ designed hissacrifice should avail for all: yea, that all flesh, every man, should partake of everlasting life. For as the Father had given him power over all flesh, so he gave himself a ransom for all.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Joh17_3"><b>17:3</b></a></span></td><td><span>To know - By loving, holy faith, thee the only true God - The only cause and end of all things; not excluding the Son and the Holy Ghost, no more than the Father is excluded from being Lord,  <a href="/1-corinthians/8-6.html"> 8:6</a> ; but the false gods of the heathens;and Jesus Christ - As their prophet, priest, and king: this is life eternal - It is both the way to, and the essence of, everlasting happiness.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Joh17_4"><b>17:4</b></a></span></td><td><span>I have finished the work - Thus have I glorified thee, laying the foundation of thy kingdom on earth.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Joh17_5"><b>17:5</b></a></span></td><td><span>The glory which I had - He does not say received - He always had it, till he emptied himself of it in the days of his flesh.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Joh17_6"><b>17:6</b></a></span></td><td><span>I have manifested thy name - All thy attributes; and in particular thy paternal relation to believers; to the men whom thou hast given me  - The apostles, and so  <a href="/john/17-12.html"> 17:12</a> .They were thine - By creation, and by descent from Abraham.

This no more proves that our Lord did not pray for the world, both before and afterward, than his praying for the apostles alone,  <a href="/john/17-6.html"> 17:6</a> - 19, proves that he did not pray for them also which shall believe through their word,  <a href="/john/17-20.html"> 17:20</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Joh17_10"><b>17:10</b></a></span></td><td><span>All things that are mine are thine, and that are thine are mine - These are very high and strong expressions, too grand for any mere creature to use; as implying that all things whatsoever, inclusive of the Divine nature, perfections, and operations, are the common property of the Father and the Son.
