Judge him that eateth - As profane, or taking undue liberties. For God hath received him - Into the number of his children, notwithstanding this.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ro14_5"><b>14:5</b></a></span></td><td><span>One day above another - As new moons, and other Jewish festivals. Let every man be fully persuaded - That a thing is lawful, before he does it.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ro14_6"><b>14:6</b></a></span></td><td><span>Regardeth it to the Lord - That is, out of a principle of conscience toward God.

It is Christ who is here termed both Lord and God; as it is he to whom we live, and to whom we die. Every tongue shall confess to God - Shall own him as their rightful Lord; which shall then only be accomplished in its full extent. The Lord grant we may find mercy in that day; and may it also be imparted to those who have differed from us! yea, to those who have censured and condemned us for things which we have done from a desire to please him, or refused to do from a fear of offending him. >Isa 45:23</cite><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ro14_13"><b>14:13</b></a></span></td><td><span>But judge this rather - Concerning ourselves.

Have it to thyself before God - In circumstances like these, keep it to thyself, and do not offend others by it.
