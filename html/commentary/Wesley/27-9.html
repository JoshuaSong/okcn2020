Tho' the altar was in ruins, and there was no oblation offered upon it, yet the pious Jews were daily thoughtful of the time when it should have been offered, and hoped that their prayer would be set forth before God as incense, and the lifting up of their hands, as the evening sacrifice. This was peculiarly a type of that great sacrifice, which Christ was to offer: and it was in virtue of that sacrifice, that Daniel's prayer was accepted, when he prayed for the Lord's sake.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Da9_24"><b>9:24</b></a></span></td><td><span>Seventy weeks - These weeks are weeks of days, and these days are so many years.
