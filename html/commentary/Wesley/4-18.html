Thus the people are in good measure secured against their fears. Also they are informed that Aaron's high dignity was attended with great burdens, having not only his own, but the people's sins to answer for; and therefore they had no such reason to envy him, if the benefits and dangers were equally considered.The iniquity of your priesthood - That is, Of all the errors committed by yourselves, or by you permitted in others in things, belonging to your priesthood.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu18_2"><b>18:2</b></a></span></td><td><span>Unto thee - About sacrifices and offerings and other things, according to the rules I have prescribed them. The Levites are said to minister to Aaron here, to the church,  <a href="/numbers/16-9.html">Numbers 16:9</a> , and to God,  <a href="/deuteronomy/10-8.html">Deuteronomy 10:8</a> . They shall not contend with thee for superiority, as theyhave done, but shall be subordinate to thee. Thy sons with thee - Or, both to thee, and to thy sons with thee: Which translation may seem to be favoured by the following words, before the tabernacle, which was the proper place where the Levites ministered. Besides, both the foregoing words, and the two following verses, entirely speak of the ministry of the Levites, and the ministry of the priests is distinctly spoken of,  <a href="/numbers/18-5.html">Numbers 18:5</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu18_3"><b>18:3</b></a></span></td><td><span>They charge - That is, that which thou shalt command them and commit unto them.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu18_5"><b>18:5</b></a></span></td><td><span>The sanctuary - Of the holy, and of the most holy place.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu18_6"><b>18:6</b></a></span></td><td><span>To you they are given as a gift - We are to value it as a great gift of the divine bounty, to have those joined to us, that will be helpful and serviceable to us, in the service of God.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu18_7"><b>18:7</b></a></span></td><td><span>The altar - Of burnt - offering. Within the veil - This phrase here comprehends both the holy and the most holy place. As a gift which I have freely conferred upon you, and upon you alone; and therefore let no man henceforth dare either to charge you with arrogance in appropriating this to yourselves, or to invade your office.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu18_8"><b>18:8</b></a></span></td><td><span>I have given them - Not only the charge, but the use of them for thyself and family.

Reserved - That is, such sacrifices or parts of sacrifices as were not burnt in the fire. Render unto me - By way of compensation for a trespass committed against me, in which case a ram was to be offered, which was a most holy thing, and may be particularly designed here.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu18_10"><b>18:10</b></a></span></td><td><span>In the most holy place - In the court of the priests, where there were places for this use, which is called the most holy place, not simply and absolutely, but in respect of the thing he speaks of because this was the most holy of all the places appointed for eating holy things, whereof some might be eaten in any clean place in the camp, or in their own house.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu18_13"><b>18:13</b></a></span></td><td><span>Whatsoever is first ripe - Not only the first - fruits of the oil and wine, and wheat now mentioned, but all other first - fruits of all other grains, and all fruit trees. Clean - And none else, because these were first offered to God, and by consequence given to priests; but for those which were immediately given to the priests, the clean and unclean might eat of them.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu18_14"><b>18:14</b></a></span></td><td><span>Devoted - Dedicated to God by vow or otherwise, provided it be such a thing as might be eaten: for the vessels or treasures of gold and silver which were dedicated by Joshua, David, or others, were not the priests, but appropriated to the uses of the temple.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu18_15"><b>18:15</b></a></span></td><td><span>Of men - Which were offered to God in his temple, and to his service and disposal.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu18_16"><b>18:16</b></a></span></td><td><span>Those that are to be redeemed - Namely, of men only, not of unclean beasts, as is manifest from the time and price of redemption here mentioned, both which agree to men; the time,  <a href="/numbers/18-16.html">Numbers 18:16</a> , the price,  <a href="/numbers/3-46.html">Numbers 3:46</a> ,47, but neither agree to unclean beasts, which were to beredeemed with a sheep,  <a href="/exodus/13-13.html"> 13:13</a> , and that after it was eight days old.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu18_17"><b>18:17</b></a></span></td><td><span>Holy - Namely, in a peculiar manner, consecrated to an holy use, even to be sacrificed to God.  <a href="/deuteronomy/15-19.html">Deuteronomy 15:19</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu18_18"><b>18:18</b></a></span></td><td><span>The flesh - All the flesh of them, and not only some parts, as in other sacrifices.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu18_19"><b>18:19</b></a></span></td><td><span>A covenant of salt - A durable and perpetual covenant; so called here and  <a href="/2-chronicles/13-5.html">2&nbsp;Chronicles 13:5</a> , either, because salt is a sign of incorruption, as being of singular use to preserve things from corruption: or, because it is ratified on their part by salt, which is therefore called the salt of the covenant, for which the priests were obliged to take care, that it should never be lacking from any meat - offering,  <a href="/leviticus/2-13.html">Leviticus 2:13</a> . And this privilege conferred upon the priests is called a covenant because it is given them conditionally, upon condition of their service, and care about the worship of God.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu18_20"><b>18:20</b></a></span></td><td><span>In their land - In the land of the children of Israel. You shall not have a distinct portion of land, as the other tribes shall. The reason of this law, was, partly because God would have them wholly devoted to his service, and therefore free from worldly incumbrances; partly, because God had abundantly provided for them otherwise, by tithes and first - fruits and oblations; and partly that by this means being dispersed among the several tribes, they might have the better opportunity for teaching and watching over the people.  I am thy part - I have appointed thee a liberal maintenance out of my oblations.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu18_21"><b>18:21</b></a></span></td><td><span>The tenth - For the tithes were all given to the Levites, and out of their tithes the tenth was given to the priests.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu18_22"><b>18:22</b></a></span></td><td><span>Nigh - So nigh as to do any proper act to the priests or Levites.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Nu18_23"><b>18:23</b></a></span></td><td><span>Their iniquity - The punishment due not only for their own, but also for the people's miscarriage, if it be committed through their connivance or negligence.
