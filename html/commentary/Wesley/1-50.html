Forty days were taken up in embalming the body, which the Egyptians had an art of doing so curiously, as to preserve the very features of the face unchanged.All this time, and thirty days more, seventy in all, they either confined themselves and sat solitary, or when they went out, appeared in the habit of close mourners, according to the decent custom of the country. Even the Egyptians, many of them, out of the respect they had for Joseph, put themselves into mourning for his father.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ge50_5"><b>50:5</b></a></span></td><td><span>He asked and obtained leave of Pharaoh to go to Canaan, to attend the funeral of his father. It was a piece of necessary respect to Pharaoh, that he would not go without leave; for we may suppose, though his charge about the corn was long since over, yet he continued a prime minister of state, and therefore would not be so long absent from his business without license.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ge50_11"><b>50:11</b></a></span></td><td><span>The solemn mourning for Jacob gave a name to the place; Abel - mizraim - The mourning of the Egyptians: which served for a testimony against the next generation of the Egyptians, who oppressed the posterity of this Jacob, to whom their ancestors shewed such respect.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ge50_15"><b>50:15</b></a></span></td><td><span>Joseph will peradventure hate us - While their father lived, they thought themselves safe under his shadow; but now he was dead, they feared the worst. A guilty conscience exposeth men to continual frights; those that would be fearless must keep themselves guiltless.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ge50_16"><b>50:16</b></a></span></td><td><span>Thy father did command - Thus in humbling ourselves to Christ by faith and repentance, we may plead that it is the command of his father and our father we should do so.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ge50_17"><b>50:17</b></a></span></td><td><span>We are the servants of the God of thy father - Not only children of the same Jacob, but worshippers of the same Jehovah. Though we must be ready to forgive all that injure us, yet we must especially take heed of bearing malice towards any that are the servants of the God of our father; those we should always treat with a peculiar tenderness, for we and they have the same master. He wept when they spake to him - These were tears of sorrow for their suspicion of him, and tears of tenderness upon their submission.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ge50_19"><b>50:19</b></a></span></td><td><span>Am I in the place of God? - He in his great humility thought they shewed him too much respect, and faith to them in effect, as Peter to Cornelius, Stand up, I myself also am a man. Make your peace with God, and then you will find it an easy matter to make your peace with me.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ge50_20"><b>50:20</b></a></span></td><td><span>Ye thought evil, but God meant it unto good - In order to the making Joseph a greater blessing to his family than otherwise he could have been.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ge50_21"><b>50:21</b></a></span></td><td><span>Fear not, I will nourish you - See what an excellent spirit Joseph was of, and learn of him to render good for evil. He did not tell them they were upon their good behaviour, and he would be kind to them if he saw they carried themselves well: no, he would not thus hold them in suspence, nor seem jealous of them, though they had been suspicious of him.He comforted them, and, to banish all their fears, he spake kindly to them. Those we love and forgive we must not only do well for, but speak kindly to.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ge50_24"><b>50:24</b></a></span></td><td><span>I die, but God will surely visit you - To this purpose Jacob had spoken to him,  <a href="/genesis/48-21.html">Genesis 48:21</a> . Thus must we comfort others with the same comforts wherewith we ourselves have been comforted of God, and encourage them to rest on those promises which have been our support.Joseph was, under God, both the protector and benefactor of his brethren, and what would become of them now he was dying? Why let this be their comfort, God will surely visit you. God's gracious visits will serve to make up the loss of our best friends, and bring you out of this land - And therefore, they must not hope to settle there, nor look upon it as their rest for ever; they must set their hearts upon the land of promise, and call that their home.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ge50_25"><b>50:25</b></a></span></td><td><span>And ye shall carry up my bones from hence - Herein he had an eye to the promise,  <a href="/genesis/15-13.html">Genesis 15:13</a> ,14, and in God's name assures them of the performance of it. In Egypt they buried their great men very honourably, and with abundance of pomp; but Joseph prefers a plain burial in Canaan, and that deferred almost two hundred years, before a magnificent one in Egypt. Thus Joseph by faith in the doctrine of the resurrection, and the promise of Canaan, gave commandment concerning his bones,  <a href="/hebrews/11-22.html">Hebrews 11:22</a> .He dies in Egypt; but lays his bones at stake, that God will surely visit Israel, and bring them to Canaan.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ge50_26"><b>50:26</b></a></span></td><td><span>He was put in a coffin in Egypt - But not buried till his children had received their inheritance in Canaan,  <a href="/joshua/24-32.html">Joshua 24:32</a> . If the soul do but return to its rest with God, the matter is not great, though the deserted body find not at all, or not quickly, its rest in the grave.Yet care ought to be taken of the dead bodies of the saints, in the belief of their resurrection; for there is a covenant with the dust which shall be remembered, and a commandment given concerning the bones.</table><!--pageCount=1-->
