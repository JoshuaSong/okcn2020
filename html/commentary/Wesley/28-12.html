Took his brother - The design of mentioning this is to mind them of that goodness which God shewed them in their father Jacob. His strength - This strength was not of nature, but of grace.Strength received of God was well employed betimes; in it he wrestled for and obtained the blessing.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ho12_4"><b>12:4</b></a></span></td><td><span>The angel - Called ver.  <a href="/hosea/12-3.html">3</a> , God; and ver.  <a href="/hosea/12-5.html">5</a> , Jehovah, Lord of hosts. He was no created angel, but the Messiah; eternal God by nature and essence, angel by office, and voluntary undertaking. He wept - He prayed with tears from a sense of his own unworthiness, and with earnestness for the mercy he desired. He - God.Him - Jacob full of weariness, fears, and solicitude on his journey to Laban. He - God.

Mercy - Shew kindness to all who need it.Judgment - Wrong none; but with justice in dealings, in judicatures; and public offices, render to every one their due. Wait on thy God - In public worship and private duties serve and trust God alone: let not idols have either sacrifice, prayer, praise, or trust from you; and let your hope and worship, be for ever continued.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ho12_7"><b>12:7</b></a></span></td><td><span>A merchant - Ephraim is so far from being as Jacob, that you may account him a Canaanite, a subtle merchant.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ho12_8"><b>12:8</b></a></span></td><td><span>I am rich - Whatever is said, yet I get what I aim at.They shall find - Yet he hugs himself in the apprehension of close carriage of his affairs, so that no great crime can be found in him: none, that is sin, that is any great enormity.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ho12_9"><b>12:9</b></a></span></td><td><span>From Egypt - From the time I brought thee out of it.In tabernacles - I have given thee all these blessings and comforts, expressed proverbially in allusion to the joy which they had at the feast of tabernacles.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ho12_10"><b>12:10</b></a></span></td><td><span>Spoken - To warn them of their danger.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ho12_11"><b>12:11</b></a></span></td><td><span>In Gilead - Tiglah Pileser had formerly took Gilead among other towns, leading the inhabitants captive. By this the prophet minds the Ephraimites what they must expect, and doth it in this pungent question, Is there iniquity in Gilead? Is it there only?Be it, Gilead was all iniquity; Gilgal is no better.They - They that come up to Gilgal to sacrifice, are idolaters.In the furrows - They are for number like heaps of stones, gathered out of plowed land and laid in furrows.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ho12_12"><b>12:12</b></a></span></td><td><span>Fled - For fear of Esau.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ho12_13"><b>12:13</b></a></span></td><td><span>A prophet - By Moses. Israel - Your forefathers.Preserved - In the wilderness.
