I will bring them again to a quiet and peaceable state in which they shall abide many days.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jer33_9"><b>33:9</b></a></span></td><td><span>They shalt fear - And not only so but shall fear to engage against a nation so beloved and favoured by me.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jer33_12"><b>33:12</b></a></span></td><td><span>Is desolate - That is, a great part of which is, and the other part shall soon be desolate.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jer33_13"><b>33:13</b></a></span></td><td><span>Shall pass - So as to keep tally of them, as they were wont to do both morning and evening in those countries.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jer33_15"><b>33:15</b></a></span></td><td><span>The branch - The kings they had hitherto had of the line of David, were most of them unrighteous men, but God promises that after the captivity, they should have a branch of David who would execute judgment and righteousness in the land, for the protection and government of those that feared him.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jer33_16"><b>33:16</b></a></span></td><td><span>Saved - It is the opinion of some that a spiritual salvation and security is promised under these expressions, but by the most and best interpreters, a temporal salvation. This was typical of that spiritual and eternal salvation which is promised to the true Israel of God; as their rest in Canaan typified that rest which remaineth for the people of God. The Lord our righteousness - There is no such name any where given, either to the Jewish or Christian church, as the Lord our righteousness, but the full import of that name is spoken of Christ,  <a href="/isaiah/45-23.html">Isaiah 45:23</a> , which text is applied to Christ,  <a href="/romans/14-11.html">Romans 14:11</a>   <a href="/jeremiah/33.html">jer 33:</a> ,  Philemon 2:10 , .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jer33_17"><b>33:17</b></a></span></td><td><span>David - That is, apparently a promise relating to Christ, for David's line had failed long since, had it not been continued in Christ, whose kingdom is and shall be an everlasting kingdom.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jer33_18"><b>33:18</b></a></span></td><td><span>A man - That is, a ministry to abide in the church to the end of the world, nor is it unusual for God in the Old Testament to express promises to be fulfilled under the gospel by expressions proper to the Old Testament.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jer33_20"><b>33:20</b></a></span></td><td><span>My covenant - The same with the ordinances mentioned, chap. <a href="/jeremiah/31-35.html">31:35</a> .
