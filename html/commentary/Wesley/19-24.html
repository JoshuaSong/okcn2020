		<span><span><center><b>The Book of Psalms<br>Chapter 24</b></center></span><p><span><b>Chapter Overview:</B></span><blockquote><br>  This psalm is generally thought to have been composed by David, upon bringing the ark of God from the house of Obed - edom, into the  tabernacle which David had built for it,  <a href="default.aspx?reference=+6:12"> 6:12</a> ,17.<br>  Wherein he hath a farther prospect to the temple, which he earnestly  desired and intended to build. Moreover because the tabernacle, and  temple, and ark, were types of Christ, and of his church and of heaven.  David extended his thoughts to them also, or at least the Holy Ghost  designed to comprehend them under these typical expressions.  He shews God's sovereignty over the world, ver. 1, 2.<br>  Who shall receive his blessing, ver. 3 - 6.<br>  An exhortation to receive Christ, ver. 7 - 10.<br>  A psalm of David. </BLOCKQUOTE><span><b>Verses:</B></span><br><TABLE WIDTH="100%" CELLPADDING="4" CELLSPACING="0" BORDER="0"><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ps24_2"><b>24:2</b></a></span></td><td><span>Seas - The whole collection of waters, as well as the sea and the rivers running into it, as that great abyss of waters which is contained in the bowels of the earth.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ps24_3"><b>24:3</b></a></span></td><td><span>The hill - Zion or Moriah, the place of God's sanctuary and special presence.

These gates he bids lift up their heads, or tops, by allusion to those gates which have a portcullis, which may be let down or taken up. And as the temple was a type of Christ, and of his church, and of heaven itself; so this place may also contain a representation, either of Christ's entrance into his church, or into the hearts of his faithful people, who are here commanded to set open their hearts and souls for his reception: or of his ascension into heaven, where the saints or angels are poetically introduced as preparing the way, and opening the heavenly gates to receive their Lord and king, returning to his royal habitation with triumph and glory.
