So purity and fruitfulness help each other.That it may bear more fruit - For this is one of the noblest rewards God can bestow on former acts of obedience, to make us yet more holy, and fit for farther and more eminent service.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Joh15_3"><b>15:3</b></a></span></td><td><span>Ye are clean - All of you, to whom I now speak, are purged from the guilt and power of sin; by the word - Which, applied by the Spirit, is the grand instrument of purifying the soul.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Joh15_4"><b>15:4</b></a></span></td><td><span>Abide in me - Ye who are now pure by living faith, producing all holiness; by which alone ye can be in me.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Joh15_5"><b>15:5</b></a></span></td><td><span>I am the vine, ye are the branches - Our Lord in this whole passage speaks of no branches but such as are, or at least were once, united to him by living faith.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Joh15_6"><b>15:6</b></a></span></td><td><span>If any one abide not in me - By living faith; not by Church communion only. He may thus abide in Christ, and be withered all the time, and cast into the fire at last. He is cast out - Of the vineyard, the invisible Church. Therefore he was in it once.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Joh15_7"><b>15:7</b></a></span></td><td><span>If ye abide in me, ye shall ask - Prayers themselves are a fruit of faith, and they produce more fruit.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Joh15_8"><b>15:8</b></a></span></td><td><span>So shall ye be my disciples - Worthy of the name. To be a disciple of Christ is both the foundation and height of Christianity.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Joh15_9"><b>15:9</b></a></span></td><td><span>Abide ye in my love - Keep your place in my affection. See that ye do not forfeit that invaluable blessing. How needless a caution, if it were impossible for them not to abide therein?</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Joh15_10"><b>15:10</b></a></span></td><td><span>If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love - On these terms, and no other, ye shall remain the objects of my special affection.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Joh15_11"><b>15:11</b></a></span></td><td><span>That my joy might remain in you - The same joy which I feel in loving the Father, and keeping his commandments.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Joh15_12"><b>15:12</b></a></span></td><td><span>Your joy will be full, if ye so love one another.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Joh15_13"><b>15:13</b></a></span></td><td><span>Greater love - To his friends. He here speaks of them only.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Joh15_14"><b>15:14</b></a></span></td><td><span>Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you - On this condition, not otherwise. A thunderbolt for Antinomianism!Who then dares assert that God's love does not at all depend on man's works?</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Joh15_15"><b>15:15</b></a></span></td><td><span>All things - Which might be of service to you.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Joh15_16"><b>15:16</b></a></span></td><td><span>Ye - My apostles, have not chosen me, but I have chosen you - As clearly appears from the sacred history: and appointed you, that ye may go and bear fruit - I have chosen and appointed you for this end, that ye may go and convert sinners: and that your fruit may remain - That the fruit of your labours may remain to the end of the world; yea, to eternity; that whatsoever ye shall ask - The consequence of your going and bearing fruit will be, that all your prayers will he heard.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Joh15_19"><b>15:19</b></a></span></td><td><span>Because ye are not of the world, therefore the world hateth you - Because your maxims, tempers, actions, are quite opposite to theirs. For the very same reason must the world in all ages hate those who are not of the world.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Joh15_20"><b>15:20</b></a></span></td><td><span>  <a href="/john/13-16.html"> 13:16</a> ; Mt 10:24; Lu 6:40.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Joh15_21"><b>15:21</b></a></span></td><td><span>All these things will they do to you, because they know not him that sent me - And in all ages and nations they who know not God will, for this cause, hate and persecute those that do.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Joh15_22"><b>15:22</b></a></span></td><td><span>They had not had sin - Not in this respect.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Joh15_23"><b>15:23</b></a></span></td><td><span>He that hateth me - As every unbeliever doth, For as the love of God is inseparable from faith, so is the hatred of God from unbelief.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Joh15_25"><b>15:25</b></a></span></td><td><span>  <a href="/psalms/69-4.html">Psalms 69:4</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Joh15_26"><b>15:26</b></a></span></td><td><span>When the Comforter is come, whom I will send from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me - The Spirit's coming, and being sent by our Lord from the Father, to testify of him, are personal characters, and plainly distinguish him from the Father and the Son; and his title as the Spirit of truth, together with his proceeding from the Father, can agree to none but a Divine person. And that he proceeds from the Son, as well as from the Father, may be fairly argued from his being called the Spirit of Christ,  <a href="/1-peter/1-11.html">1&nbsp;Peter 1:11</a> ; and from his being here said to besent by Christ from the Father, as well as sent by the Father in his name.</table><span><!--pageCount=1-->
