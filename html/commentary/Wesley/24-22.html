Lebanon also was a very pleasant place: they were both in the lot of Gad and Manasseh.Perhaps God compares the king of Judah's house to these places, in regard of the height and nobleness of the structure, or for the pleasantness and delightfulness of it.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jer22_10"><b>22:10</b></a></span></td><td><span>Weep not - For Josiah your dead prince. Josiah is happy, you need not trouble yourselves for him; but weep for Jehoahaz, who is to go into captivity.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jer22_11"><b>22:11</b></a></span></td><td><span>Shallum - Most think that this Shallum was Jehoahaz.Went forth - He was carried away from Jerusalem presently after he was set up, imprisoned at Riblah, and died in Egypt.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jer22_16"><b>22:16</b></a></span></td><td><span>Was not this - They only truly know God who obey him; men vainly pretend to piety who are defective in justice and charity.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jer22_19"><b>22:19</b></a></span></td><td><span>Of an ass - None attending him to his grave, none mourning for him.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jer22_20"><b>22:20</b></a></span></td><td><span>Lebanon - Jerusalem was the place to which this speech is directed: the inhabitants of which the prophet calls to go up to Lebanon.Both Lebanon and Bashan were hills that looked towards Assyria, from whence the Jews looked for help. Abarim - Abarim is the name of a mountain, as well as Lebanon and Bashan. Go and cry for help from all places, but it will be in vain; for the Egyptians and Assyrians to whom thou wert wont to fly, are themselves in the power of the Chaldeans.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jer22_22"><b>22:22</b></a></span></td><td><span>Pastors - Thy rulers and governors, they shall be blasted by my judgments, as plants are blasted by winds.
