And this premonition was highly necessary, both to caution the Jews that they should not stumble at this stone, and to instruct the Gentiles that they should not be seduced with their example. The arm - The Messiah, called the arm or power of God, because the almighty power of God was seated in him.Revealed - Inwardly and with power.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa53_2"><b>53:2</b></a></span></td><td><span>As a root - And the reason why the Jews will generally reject their Messiah, is, because he shall not come into the world with secular pomp, but he shall grow up, (or spring up, out of the ground) before him, (before the unbelieving Jews, of whom he spake ver.  <a href="/isaiah/53-1.html">1</a> , and that in the singular number, as here, who were witnesses of his mean original; and therefore despised him) as a tender plant (small and inconsiderable) and as a root, or branch, grows out of a dry, barren ground. No form - His bodily presence shall be mean and contemptible.No beauty - This the prophet speaks in the person of the unbelieving Jews. We - Our people, the Jewish nation.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa53_3"><b>53:3</b></a></span></td><td><span>We hid - We scorned to look upon him.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa53_4"><b>53:4</b></a></span></td><td><span>Yet - Our people believed that he was thus punished by the just judgment of God.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa53_5"><b>53:5</b></a></span></td><td><span>Wounded - Which word comprehends all his pains and punishments.For our iniquities - For the guilt of their sins, which he had voluntarily taken upon himself, and for the expiation of their sins, which was hereby purchased.

Astray - From God. Have turned - In general, to the way of sin, which may well be called a man's own way, because sin is natural to us, inherent in us, born with us; and in particular, to those several paths, which several men chuse, according to their different opinions, and circumstances. Hath laid - Heb. hath made to meet, as all the rivers meet in the sea. The iniquity - Not properly, for he knew no sin; but the punishment of iniquity, as that word is frequently used.

Cut off - By a violent death.And this may be added as a reason of the blessing of a numerous posterity conferred upon him, because he was willing to be cut off for the transgression of his people.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa53_9"><b>53:9</b></a></span></td><td><span>With the wicked - This was a farther degree of humiliation.He saith, he made his grave, because this was Christ's own act, and he willingly yielded up himself to death and burial. And that which follows, with the wicked, does not denote the sameness of place, as if he should be buried in the same grave with other malefactors, but the sameness of condition.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa53_10"><b>53:10</b></a></span></td><td><span>He - God was the principal cause of all his sufferings, tho' mens sins were the deserving cause.
