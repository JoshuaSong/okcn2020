		<span><span><center><b>The Book of Joshua<br>Chapter 23</b></center></span><p><span><b>Chapter Overview:</B></span><blockquote><br>  Joshua reminds the people, assembled for that purpose,  of what God had done, and what he would do for them, ver. 1 - 5.<br>  Exhorts them resolutely to persevere in their duty to God, ver. 6 - 8.<br>  which he enforces by former benefits, and by promises, ver. 9 - 11.<br>  and by threatnings, ver. 12 - 16.<br></BLOCKQUOTE><span><b>Verses:</B></span><br><TABLE WIDTH="100%" CELLPADDING="4" CELLSPACING="0" BORDER="0"><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jos23_1"><b>23:1</b></a></span></td><td><span>A long time - About fourteen years after it.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jos23_2"><b>23:2</b></a></span></td><td><span>Joshua called - Either to his own city, or rather to Shiloh, the usual place of such assemblies, where his words being uttered before the Lord, were likely to have the more effect upon them. All Israel - Not all the people in their own persons, but in their representatives, by their elders, heads, judges and officers.Probably he took the opportunity, of one of the three great feasts.You will not have me long to preach to you; therefore observe what I say, and lay it up for the time to come.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jos23_3"><b>23:3</b></a></span></td><td><span>Because of you - For your good, that you might gain by their losses.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jos23_4"><b>23:4</b></a></span></td><td><span>That remain - Not yet conquered. An inheritance - You shall certainly subdue them, and inherit their hand, as you have done the rest, if you be not wanting to yourselves. All the nations - That is, with the land of those nations; the people put for their land, as we have seen before; and as sometimes on the contrary, the land is put for the people. The great sea - Where the Philistines, your most formidable adversaries yet survive; but them also and their land I have given to you, and you shall undoubtedly destroy them, if you will proceed vigorously in your work.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jos23_6"><b>23:6</b></a></span></td><td><span>Very courageous - For it will require great courage and resolution to execute all the commands of Moses, and particularly, that of expelling and destroying the residue of the Canaanites.The right hand or the left - That is, in one kind or other, by adding to the law, or diminishing from it.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jos23_7"><b>23:7</b></a></span></td><td><span>Come not - That is, avoid all familiar converse and contracts, but especially marriages with them. Name their gods - To wit, unnecessarily and familiarly, lest the mention of them breed discourse about them, and so by degrees bring to the approbation and worship of them. Nor cause - Nor require nor compel the Gentiles to swear by them, as they used to do; especially in leagues and contracts. It is pity, that among Christians, the name of the Heathen God's are so commonly used, especially in poems. Let those names which have been set up in rivalship with God, be forever loathed and lost. Nor bow - Neither give them any inward reverence, or outward adoration. Here is an observable gradation, whereby he shews what notable progress sin usually makes, and what need there is to look to the beginnings of it, forasmuch as a civil and common conversation with their persons was likely to bring them, and indeed did actually bring them, by insensible steps, to the worship of their gods. So it is no wonder, if some things not simply and in themselves evil, be forbidden by God, as here the naming of their gods is, because they are occasions and introductions to evil.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jos23_8"><b>23:8</b></a></span></td><td><span>Cleave to the Lord - By constant obedience, entire affection, faithful service and worship of him alone. To this day - To wit, since you came in to Canaan; since which time the body of the people (for of them he speaks, not of every particular person) had behaved themselves much better than they did in the wilderness, and had not been guilty of any gross and general apostacy from God, or rebellion against him.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jos23_9"><b>23:9</b></a></span></td><td><span>No man - To wit, whom you have invaded; otherwise some of those people did yet remain unconquered.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jos23_10"><b>23:10</b></a></span></td><td><span>He fighteth - Impute not this therefore to your own valour, as you will be apt to do, but to God's gracious and powerful assistance.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jos23_11"><b>23:11</b></a></span></td><td><span>Take heed - Now it requires more watchfulness and diligence than it did in the wilderness, because your temptations are now stronger; from the examples and insinuations of your bad neighbours, the remainders of this wicked people; and from your own peace and prosperity: and the pride, security, forgetfulness of God, and luxury, which usually attend that condition.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jos23_12"><b>23:12</b></a></span></td><td><span>Go back - From God, and from his worship and service.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jos23_13"><b>23:13</b></a></span></td><td><span>Traps to you - By your converse with them, you will be drawn by degrees into their errors, and impieties, and brutish lusts. Thorns in your eyes - When they have seduced, and thereby weakened you, then they will molest and vex you, no less than a severe scourge doth a man's sides which are lashed by it, or than a small thorn doth the eye when it is got within it. Till ye perish - They shall so persecute you, and fight against, you with such success, that you shall be forced to quit your own land, and wander you know not whither; which must needs be very terrible to them to think of, when they compared this present ease, and plenty and safety, with the pains, and weariness, and hazards, and wants of their former wanderings.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jos23_14"><b>23:14</b></a></span></td><td><span>Of all the earth - That is, of all flesh, or of all men; the way which all men go; I am about to die, as all men must. To die is, to go a journey, a journey to our long home. And Joshua himself, tho' he could so ill be spared, cannot be exempted from this common lot. He takes notice of it, that they might look on these as his dying words, and regard them accordingly. Ye know - That is, you know assuredly; your own experience puts it out of all question.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jos23_15"><b>23:15</b></a></span></td><td><span>Evil things - The accomplishment of God's promise is a pledge that he will also fulfil his threatnings; both of them depending upon the same ground, the faithfulness of God.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jos23_16"><b>23:16</b></a></span></td><td><span>It will aggravate their perdition, that the land from which they shall perish is a good land, and a land which God himself had given them: and which therefore he would have secured to them, if they had not thrown themselves out of it. "Thus the goodness of the heavenly Canaan, says Mr. Henry, and the free and sure grant God has made of it, will aggravate the misery of those that shall forever be shut out and perish from it. Nothing will make them see how wretched they are, so much as to see, how happy they might have been."  Might have been!What on the supposition of absolute decrees? How happy might a person not elected have been? And if he was elected, how could he be wretched for ever? What art of man can reconcile these things?Again, shall any of the elect perish for ever? or has God made to any others, a free and sure grant of the heavenly Canaan? If not, how can the misery of those that perish be aggravated, by a free and sure grant which they never had any share in?</table><span><!--pageCount=1-->
