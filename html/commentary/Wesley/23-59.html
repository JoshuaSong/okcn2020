Bring forth - These two words of conceiving, and bringing forth, denote their whole contrivance, and perfecting their wickedness.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa59_5"><b>59:5</b></a></span></td><td><span>Cockatrice eggs - One kind put for any venomous creature, a proverbial speech signifying by these eggs mischievous designs, and by hatching them, their putting them in practice. Web - Another proverbial speech whereby is taught, both how by their plots they weave nets, lay snares industriously with great pains and artifice.And also how their designs will come to nothing, as the spider's web is soon swept away.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa59_6"><b>59:6</b></a></span></td><td><span>Webs - Their contrivances shall not be able to cover or defend them.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa59_7"><b>59:7</b></a></span></td><td><span>Wasting - They meditate on little or nothing else. Paths - In what way or work soever they are engaged, it all tends to ruin and destruction.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa59_8"><b>59:8</b></a></span></td><td><span>The way of peace - They live in continual contentions, and discords. Judgment - No justice, equity, faith, or integrity.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa59_9"><b>59:9</b></a></span></td><td><span>Justice - Judgment, and so justice is here taken for deliverance. God doth not defend our right, nor revenge our wrong, because of these outrages, and acts of violence, injustice, and oppression.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa59_10"><b>59:10</b></a></span></td><td><span>As dead men - He compares their captivity to men dead without hope of recovery.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa59_11"><b>59:11</b></a></span></td><td><span>Mourn - Their oppressing governors made the wicked roar like bears, and the good mourn like doves.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa59_12"><b>59:12</b></a></span></td><td><span>Transgressions - The word here signifies sins of an high nature, such as wherein there is much of man's will against light: rebellious sins.Multiplied - They admit of no excuse; for they are acted before thee, and multiplied against thee, whereby thou art justly provoked to deny us all help. Testify - As so many witnesses produced proves our guilt.Are with us - Are still unforgiven. We know - We are convinced of them.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa59_13"><b>59:13</b></a></span></td><td><span>Lying - Transgressing here, and lying, seem to be one and the same thing, inasmuch as in their transgressing the law of God, they broke their solemn engagement to God upon mount Sinai.Departing - Turning from God to idols. Speaking - As it were, talking of little else one among another, but how to oppress their neighbours, and apostatize from God. Uttering - That is, first contriving in their heart false accusations, false worship to the dishonour of God; laying the contrivances and uttering them. From the heart - And when they dealt with men in ways of fraud, it was from the heart, but when they spake with God it was but from the lip.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa59_14"><b>59:14</b></a></span></td><td><span>Judgment - He speaks here of the sentences in courts of judicature.

A prey - Or, as some render it, is accounted mad, is laughed at. Josephus tells us, that immediately before the destruction of Jerusalem, it was matter of scorn to be religions. The translators reach the meaning of the word by prey: the wicked, like wild beasts, endeavouring to devour such as are not as bad as themselves: where wickedness rules, innocency is oppressed.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa59_16"><b>59:16</b></a></span></td><td><span>No man - To appear in the behalf of equity. His arm - He would do his work without help from any other. Righteousness - His justice; seeing there could be no justice found among them, he would avenge the innocent himself.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa59_17"><b>59:17</b></a></span></td><td><span>For - God, resolving to appear as a man of war, puts on his arms; he calls righteousness his breast - plate, to shew the justness of his cause, as also his faithfulness in making good his promises.Vengeance - Or garments made of vengeance: as God is said to put on the former for their sakes, whom he would preserve, so he puts on these for their sakes, whom he will destroy, namely, his peoples enemies.Zeal - For his own honour, and for his own people. The sum of all these expressions is, to describe both the cause and effect together; the cause was righteousness and zeal in God, the effect, salvation to his people, and vengeance on his enemies.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Isa59_18"><b>59:18</b></a></span></td><td><span>Deeds - Heb. recompences or deserts.
