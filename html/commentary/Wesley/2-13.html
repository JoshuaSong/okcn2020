The strictness enjoined in this matter was designed, <ol><li> To make the feast the more solemn, and consequently the more taken    notice of by the children, who would ask, why is so much ado made?<li> To teach us how solicitous we should be to put away from us all sin.</ol><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ex13_9"><b>13:9</b></a></span></td><td><span>Upon thy hand, between thine eyes - Proverbial expressions; denoting things which are never out of our thoughts.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ex13_13"><b>13:13</b></a></span></td><td><span>Thou shalt redeem - The price of the redemption was fixed by the law.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ex13_16"><b>13:16</b></a></span></td><td><span>For frontlets between thine eyes - As conspicuous as any thing fixt to thy forehead, or between thine eyes.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ex13_18"><b>13:18</b></a></span></td><td><span>There were many reasons why God led them through the way of the wilderness of the red sea. The Egyptians were to be drowned in the Red - sea, the Israelites were to be humbled, and proved in the wilderness.  <a href="/deuteronomy/8.html">Deuteronomy 8:</a>   <a href="/exodus/13-2.html">2</a> , .God had given it to Moses for a sign,  <a href="/exodus/3-12.html">Exodus 3:12</a> , ye shall serve God in this mountain. They had again and again told Pharaoh that they must go three days journey into the wilderness to do sacrifice, and therefore it was requisite they should march that way, else they had justly been exclaimed against as dissemblers. Before they entered the lifts with their enemies, matters must be settled between them and their God; laws must be given, ordinances instituted, covenants sealed; and for the doing of this it was necessary they should retire into the solitudes of a wilderness, the only closet for such a crowd; the high road would be no proper place for these transactions. The reason why God did not lead them the nearest way, which would have brought them in a few days to the land of the Philistines, was because they were not yet fit for war, much less for war with the Philistines. Their spirits were broke with slavery; the Philistines were formidable enemies; it was convenient they should begin with the Amalekites, and be prepared for the wars of Canaan, by experiencing the difficulties of the wilderness. God is said to bring Israel out of Egypt as the eagle brings up her young ones,  <a href="/deuteronomy/32-11.html">Deuteronomy 32:11</a> , teaching them by degrees to fly.They went up harnessed - They went up by five in a rank, so some; in five squadrons, so others. They marched like an army with banners, which added much to strength and honour.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ex13_21"><b>13:21</b></a></span></td><td><span>And the Lord went before them in a pillar - In the two first stages, it was enough that God directed Moses whither to march; he knew the country, and the road; but now they are come to the edge of the wilderness, they would have occasion for a guide, and a very good guide they had, infinitely wise, kind, and faithful, the Lord went up before them; The Shechinah or appearance of the divine Majesty, which was a precious manifestation of the eternal Word, who in the fulness of time was to be made flesh, and dwell among us. Christ was with the church in the wilderness,  <a href="/1-corinthians/10-9.html"> 10:9</a> . What a satisfaction to Moses and the pious Israelites, to be sure that they were under a divine conduct? They need not fear missing their way who were thus led, nor being lost who were thus directed; they need not fear being benighted, who were thus illuminated, nor being robbed, who were thus protected. And they who make the glory of God their end, and the word of God their rule, the spirit of God the guide of their affections, and the providence of God the guide of their affairs, may be confident that the Lord goes before them, as truly is he went before Israel in the wilderness, though not so sensibly. They had sensible effects of God's going before them in this pillar. For, It led them the way in that vast howling wilderness, in which there was no road, no track, no way - marks through which they had no guides. When they marched, this pillar went before them, at the rate that they could follow, and appointed the place of their encampment, as infinite Wisdom saw fit; which eased them from care, and secured them from danger, both in moving, and in resting.It sheltered them from the heat by day, which at sometimes of the year was extreme: And it gave them light by night when they had occasion for it.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ex13_22"><b>13:22</b></a></span></td><td><span>He took not away the pillar of the cloud, - No not when they seemed to have less occasion for it: it never left them 'till it brought them to the borders of Canaan. It was a cloud which the wind could not scatter. There was something spiritual in this pillar of cloud and fire.<ol><li> The children of Israel were baptized unto Moses in this   cloud,  <a href="/1-corinthians/10-2.html"> 10:2</a> . By coming under this cloud they signified   their putting themselves under the conduct and command of Moses.   Protection draws allegiance; this cloud was the badge of God's   protection, and so became the bond of their allegiance. Thus they   were initiated, and admitted under that government, now when they were   entering upon the wilderness.<li> And it signifies the special conduct and protection which the church of   Christ is under in this world.</ol></table><span><!--pageCount=1-->
