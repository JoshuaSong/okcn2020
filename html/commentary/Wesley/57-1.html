And it gives us a specimen how Christians ought to treat of secular affairs from higher principles. Paul a prisoner of Christ - To whom, as such, Philemon could deny nothing. And Timotheus - This was written before the second epistle to Timothy,  <a href="/philemon/22.html">Philemon 22</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Phm1_2"><b>1:2</b></a></span></td><td><span>To Apphia - His wife, to whom also the business in part belonged. And the church in thy house - The Christians who meet there.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Phm1_5"><b>1:5</b></a></span></td><td><span>Hearing - Probably from Onesimus.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Phm1_6"><b>1:6</b></a></span></td><td><span>I pray that the communication of thy faith may become effectual - That is, that thy faith may be effectually communicated to others, who see and acknowledge thy piety and charity.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Phm1_7"><b>1:7</b></a></span></td><td><span>The saints - To whom Philemon's house was open,  <a href="/philemon/2.html">Philemon 2</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Phm1_8"><b>1:8</b></a></span></td><td><span>I might be bold in Christ - Through the authority he hath given me.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Phm1_9"><b>1:9</b></a></span></td><td><span>Yet out of love I rather entreat thee - In how handsome a manner does the apostle just hint, and immediately drop, the consideration of his power to command, and tenderly entreat Philemon to hearken to his friend, his aged friend, and now prisoner for Christ! With what endearment, in the next verse, does he call Onesimus his son, before he names his name! And as soon as he had mentioned it, with what fine address does he just touch on his former faults, and instantly pass on to the happy change that was now made upon him! So disposing Philemon to attend to his request, and the motives wherewith he was going to enforce it.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Phm1_10"><b>1:10</b></a></span></td><td><span>Whom I have begotten in my bonds - The son of my age.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Phm1_11"><b>1:11</b></a></span></td><td><span>Now profitable - None should be expected to be a good servant before he is a good man.
