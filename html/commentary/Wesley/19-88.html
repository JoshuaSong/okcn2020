		<span><span><center><b>The Book of Psalms<br>Chapter 88</b></center></span><p><span><b>Chapter Overview:</B></span><blockquote><br>  This is the most melancholy of all the psalms: it is all lamentation,  and mourning, and woe. Here we have the pressure of spirit which the  psalmist was under, ver. 1 - 9.<br>  His humble pleadings with God, ver. 10 - 14.<br>  A farther declaration of his affliction, ver. 15 - 18.<br>  A song or psalm for the sons of Korah, to the chief musician upon  Mahalath Leannoth, Maschil of Heman the Ezrahite. <br>&nbsp;<br>Title of the psalm. Leannoth - Which seems to be the name of the instrument. Heman - Probably the same person who was famous in David's time, both for his skill in musick, and for wisdom.</BLOCKQUOTE><span><b>Verses:</B></span><br><TABLE WIDTH="100%" CELLPADDING="4" CELLSPACING="0" BORDER="0"><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ps88_4"><b>88:4</b></a></span></td><td><span>Counted - l am given up by my friends for a lost man.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ps88_5"><b>88:5</b></a></span></td><td><span>Free - Well nigh discharged from the warfare of the present life, and entered as a member into the society of the dead.
