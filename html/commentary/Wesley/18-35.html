Unto thee - Unto me; such changes of persons being frequent in the Hebrew language.What profit, &c. - God does not reward so much as I deserve. But it was not fair to charge this upon Job, which he had neither directly nor indirectly affirmed.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job35_5"><b>35:5</b></a></span></td><td><span>Clouds, &c. - They are far above us, and God is far above them.How much then is he out of the reach either of our sins or our services?</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job35_9"><b>35:9</b></a></span></td><td><span>Cry - Thus one man's wickedness may hurt another.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job35_10"><b>35:10</b></a></span></td><td><span>None - Few or none of the great numbers of oppressed persons.God - They cry out to men, but they seek not God, and therefore if God do not hear their cries it is not unjust. Maker - Who alone made me, and who only can deliver me. Who when our condition is ever so dark and sad, can turn our darkness into light, can quickly put a new song in our mouth, a thanksgiving unto our God.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job35_11"><b>35:11</b></a></span></td><td><span>Who - This is an aggravation of mens neglect of God in their misery. God hath given men, what he hath denied to beasts, wisdom to know God and themselves. Therefore they are inexcusable, for not using that wisdom, by calling on God in the time of trouble.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job35_12"><b>35:12</b></a></span></td><td><span>Because - God doth not answer their cries, because they are both evil, wicked and impenitent, and proud, unhumbled for those sins for which God brought these miseries upon them.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job35_13"><b>35:13</b></a></span></td><td><span>Vanity - Vain persons, that have no wisdom or piety in them.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job35_14"><b>35:14</b></a></span></td><td><span>See him - Thou canst not understand his dealings with thee.Here Elihu answers another objection of Job's: and tells him that though God may for a season delay to answer, yet he will certainly do him right. Judgment - Justice is at his tribunal, and in all his ways and administrations. Trust - Instead of murmuring, repent of what is past, humble thyself under God's hand, wait patiently in his way, 'till deliverance come; for it will certainly come if thou dost nothinder it.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Job35_15"><b>35:15</b></a></span></td><td><span>Because - Because Job doth not acknowledge God's justice and his own sins. He - God. Anger - Hath laid grievous afflictions upon him. He - Job is not sensible of it, so as to be humbled under God's hand.</table><span><!--pageCount=1-->
