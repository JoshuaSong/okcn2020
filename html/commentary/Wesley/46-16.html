		<span><span><center><b>The Book of 1&nbsp;Corinthians<br>Chapter 16</b></center></span><span><b>Verses:</B></span><br><TABLE WIDTH="100%" CELLPADDING="4" CELLSPACING="0" BORDER="0"><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Co16_1"><b>16:1</b></a></span></td><td><span>The saints - A more solemn and a more affecting word, than if he had said, the poor.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Co16_2"><b>16:2</b></a></span></td><td><span>Let every one - Not the rich only: let him also that hath little, gladly give of that little. According as he hath been prospered - Increasing his alms as God increases his substance. According to this lowest rule of Christian prudence, if a man when he has or gains one pound give a tenth to God, when he has or gains an hundred he will give the tenth of this also. And yet I show unto you a more excellent way.He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. Stint yourself to no proportion at all. But lend to God all you can.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Co16_4"><b>16:4</b></a></span></td><td><span>They shall go with me - To remove any possible suspicion.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Co16_5"><b>16:5</b></a></span></td><td><span>I pass through Macedonia - I purpose going that way.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Co16_7"><b>16:7</b></a></span></td><td><span>I will not see you now - Not till I have been in Macedonia.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Co16_8"><b>16:8</b></a></span></td><td><span>I will stay at Ephesus - Where he was at this time.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Co16_9"><b>16:9</b></a></span></td><td><span>A great door - As to the number of hearers. And effectual - As to the effects wrought upon them. And there are many adversaries - As there must always be where Satan's kingdom shakes. This was another reason for his staying there.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Co16_10"><b>16:10</b></a></span></td><td><span>Without fear - Of any one's despising him for his youth. For he worketh the work of the Lord - The true ground of reverence to pastors. Those who do so, none ought to despise.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Co16_11"><b>16:11</b></a></span></td><td><span>I look for him with the brethren - That accompany him.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Co16_12"><b>16:12</b></a></span></td><td><span>I besought him much - To come to you. With the brethren - Who were then going to Corinth. Yet he was by no means willing to come now - Perhaps lest his coming should increase the divisions among them.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Co16_13"><b>16:13</b></a></span></td><td><span>To conclude. Watch ye - Against all your seen and unseen enemies. Stand fast in the faith - Seeing and trusting him that is invisible. Acquit yourselves like men - With courage and patience. Be strong - To do and suffer all his will.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Co16_15"><b>16:15</b></a></span></td><td><span>The first fruits of Achaia - The first converts in that province.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Co16_16"><b>16:16</b></a></span></td><td><span>That ye also - In your turn. Submit to such - So repaying their free service. And to every one that worketh with us and laboureth - That labours in the gospel either with or without a fellow - labourer.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Co16_17"><b>16:17</b></a></span></td><td><span>I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas, and Fortunatus, and Achaiacus - Who were now returned to Corinth but the joy which their arrival had occasioned remained still in his heart. They have supplied what was wanting on your part - They have performed the offices of love, which you could not, by reason of your absence.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Co16_18"><b>16:18</b></a></span></td><td><span>For they have refreshed my spirit and yours - Inasmuch as you share in my comfort.

Let him be Anathema. Maran - atha - Anathema signifies a thing devoted to destruction. It seems to have been customary with the Jews of that age, when they had pronounced any man an Anathema, to add the Syriac expression, Maran - atha, that is, "The Lord cometh;" namely, to execute vengeance upon him. This weighty sentence the apostle chose to write with his own hand; and to insert it between his salutation and solemn benediction, that it might be the more attentively regarded.</table><!--pageCount=1-->
