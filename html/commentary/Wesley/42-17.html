In a lower sense we are to forgive all, penitent or impenitent; (so as to bear them the sincerest good will, and to do them all the good we can;) and that not seven times only, but seventy times seven.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Lu17_5"><b>17:5</b></a></span></td><td><span>Lord, increase our faith - That we may thus forgive, and may neither offend nor be offended.  <a href="/matthew/17-20.html">Matthew 17:20</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Lu17_6"><b>17:6</b></a></span></td><td><span>And he said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed - If ye had the least measure of true faith, no instance of duty would be too hard for you.

Happy is he who judges himself an unprofitable servant: miserable is he whom God pronounces such.But though we are unprofitable to him, our serving him is not unprofitable to us.
