Probably there never was any house or temple built for sacred uses, before this tabernacle was erected by Moses. In this God kept his court, as Israel's king, and it was intended for a sign or token of his presence, that while they had that in the midst of them they might never again ask, Is the Lord among us or not? And because in the wilderness they dwelt in tents, even this royal palace was ordered to be a tabernacle too, that it might move with them. And these holy places made with hands were the figures of the true,  <a href="/hebrews/9-24.html">Hebrews 9:24</a> . The gospel - church is thetrue tabernacle which the Lord pitched, and not man,  <a href="/hebrews/8-2.html">Hebrews 8:2</a> .The body of Christ, in and by which he made atonement, was the greater and more perfect tabernacle,  <a href="/hebrews/9-11.html">Hebrews 9:11</a> .The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, as in a tabernacle.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ex25_2"><b>25:2</b></a></span></td><td><span>Speak unto the children of Israel that they bring me an offering  - This offering was to be given willingly, and with the heart. Itwas not prescribed to them what or how much they must give, but it was left to their generosity, that they might shew their good - will to the house of God, and the offices thereof.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ex25_4"><b>25:4</b></a></span></td><td><span>Blue, and purple, and scarlet - Materials of those colours.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ex25_5"><b>25:5</b></a></span></td><td><span>Shittim - wood - A kind of wood growing in Egypt and the deserts of Arabia, very durable and precious.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ex25_8"><b>25:8</b></a></span></td><td><span>A sanctuary - A place of public and solemn worship; that I may dwell among them. Not by my essence, which is everywhere; but by my grace and glorious operations.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ex25_9"><b>25:9</b></a></span></td><td><span>According to all that I shew thee - God shewed him an exact plan of it in little, which he must conform to in all points. And God did not only shew him the model, but gave him also particular directions how to frame the tabernacle, according to that model, in all the parts of it. When Moses was to describe the creation of the world, tho' it be such a stately and curious fabrick, yet he gave a very short and general account of it; but when he comes to describe the tabernacle, he doth it with the greatest niceness and accuracy imaginable: for God's church and instituted religion is more precious to him than all the rest of the world. And the scriptures were written not to describe to us the works of nature, (a general view of which is sufficient to lead us to the knowledge of theCreator,) but to acquaint us with the methods of grace, and those things which are purely matters of revelation.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ex25_10"><b>25:10</b></a></span></td><td><span>The ark was a chest or coffer, in which the two tables of the law, written with the finger of God, were to be deposited. If the Jewish cubit was, as some learned men compute three inches longer than our half - yard, (twenty one inches in all) this chest or cabinet was about fifty - two inches long, thirty - one broad and thirty one deep; it was overlaid within and without with thin plates of gold; it had a crown, or cornish of gold round it; rings and staves to carry it with; and in it he must put the testimony. The tables of the law are called the testimony, because God did in them testify his will; his giving them that law was in token of his favour to them, and their acceptance of it was in token of their subjection to him. This law was a testimony to them to direct them in their duty, and would be a testimony against them if they transgressed. The ark is called the ark of the testimony,  <a href="/exodus/30-6.html"> 30:6</a> , and the tabernacle, the tabernacle of the testimony,  <a href="/numbers/10-11.html">Numbers 10:11</a> . The tables of the law were carefully preserved in the ark, to teach us to make much of the word of God, and to hide it in our inmost thoughts, as the ark was placed in the holy of holies. It intimates likewise the care which divine providence ever did, and ever will take to preserve the records of divine revelation in the church, so that even in the latter days there shall be seen in his temple the ark of his testament. See  <a href="/revelation/11-19.html">Revelation 11:19</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ex25_17"><b>25:17</b></a></span></td><td><span>The mercy - seat was the covering of the ark, made exactly to fit the dimensions of it. This propitiatory covering, as it might well be translated, was a type of Christ the great propitiation, whose satisfaction covers our transgressions, and comes between us and the curse we deserve.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ex25_18"><b>25:18</b></a></span></td><td><span>The cherubim (Cherubim is the plural of Cherub, not Cherubims) were fixed to the mercy - seat, and of a piece with it, and spread their wings over it. It is supposed these were designed to represent the holy angels, (who always attend the Shechinah, or divine majesty,) not by any effigies of an angel, but some emblem of the angelical nature, probably one or more of those four faces spoken of  <a href="/ezekiel/1-10.html">Ezekiel 1:10</a> .Whatever the faces were, they looked one towards another, and both downwards towards the ark, while their wings were stretched out so as to touch one another. It notes their attendance upon the Redeemer, their readiness to do his will, their presence in the assemblies of saints,  <a href="/psalms/68-17.html">Psalms 68:17</a>   <a href="/exodus/25.html">ex 25:</a> ,  <a href="/1-corinthians/11-10.html"> 11:10</a> , and their desire to look into the mysteriesof the gospel, which they diligently contemplate,  <a href="/1-peter/1-12.html">1&nbsp;Peter 1:12</a> . God is said to dwell or sit between the cherubim, on the mercy - seat,  <a href="/psalms/80-1.html">Psalms 80:1</a> , and from thence he here promiseth for the future tomeet with Moses, and to commune with him. Thus he manifests himself, willing to keep up communion with us, by the mediation of Christ.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ex25_23"><b>25:23</b></a></span></td><td><span>This table was to stand not in the holy of holies, (nothing was in that but the ark with its appurtenances) but in the outer part of the tabernacle, called the sanctuary or holy place. This table was to be always furnished with the shew - bread, or bread of faces, twelve loaves, one for each tribe, set in two rows, six in a row. As the ark signified God's being present with them, so the twelve loaves signified their being presented to God. This bread was designed to be, a thankful acknowledgment of God's goodness to them in giving them their daily bread, a token of their communion with God; this bread on God's table being made of the same corn as the bread on their own tables. And a type of the spiritual provision which is made in the church, by the gospel of Christ, for all that are made priests to our God.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ex25_31"><b>25:31</b></a></span></td><td><span>This candlestick had many branches drawn from the main shaft, which had not only bowls to put the oil and the kindled wick in for necessity, but knops made in the form of a pomegranate and flowers for ornament. The tabernacle had no windows, all its light was candle - light, which notes the comparative darkness of that dispensation, while the sun of righteousness was not as yet risen, nor had the day - star from on high visited his church. Yet God left not himself without witness, nor them without instruction; the commandment was a lamp, and the law a light, and the prophets were branches from that lamp, which gave light in their several ages. The church is still dark, as the tabernacle was, in comparison with what it will be in heaven: but the word of God is the candlestick, a light burning in a dark place.</table><span><!--pageCount=1-->
