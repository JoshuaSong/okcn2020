But how amazingly does the prince of darkness blind the minds of them that believe not!The Jews would not own Christ's Godhead, though they saw him work numberless miracles. On the other hand, the heathens seeing mere men work one miracle, were for deifying them immediately.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ac14_13"><b>14:13</b></a></span></td><td><span>The priest of Jupiter - Whose temple and image were just without the gate of the city, brought garlands - To put on the victims, and bulls - The usual offerings to Jupiter.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ac14_14"><b>14:14</b></a></span></td><td><span>They sprang in among the people, crying out - As in a fire, or other sudden and great danger.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ac14_15"><b>14:15</b></a></span></td><td><span>To turn from these vanities - From worshipping any but the true God. He does not deign to call them gods; unto the living God - Not like these dead idols; who made the heaven and the earth, the sea - Each of which they supposed to have its own gods.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ac14_16"><b>14:16</b></a></span></td><td><span>Who in times past - He prevents their objection, "But if these things are so, we should have heard the in from our fathers." Suffered - An awful judgment, all nations - The multitude of them that err does not turn error into truth, to walk in their own ways - The idolatries which they had chosen.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ac14_17"><b>14:17</b></a></span></td><td><span>He left not himself without witness - For the heathens had always from God himself a testimony both of his existence and of his providence; in that he did good - Even by punishments he testifies of himself; but more peculiarly by benefits; giving rain - By which air, earth, and sea, are, as it were, all joined together; from heaven - The seat of God; to which St. Paul probably pointed while he spoke, filling the body with food, the soul with gladness.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ac14_19"><b>14:19</b></a></span></td><td><span>Who persuaded the multitude - Moved with equal ease either to adore or murder him.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ac14_20"><b>14:20</b></a></span></td><td><span>But as the disciples stood round - Probably after sunset. The enraged multitude would scarce have suffered it in the day time: he rose and went into the city - That he should be able to do this, just after he had been left for dead, was a miracle little less than a resurrection from the dead. Especially considering the manner wherein the Jewish malefactors were stoned. The witnesses first threw as large a stone as they could lift, with all possible violence upon his head, which alone was sufficient to dash the skull in pieces. All the people then joined, as long as any motion or token of life remained.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ac14_23"><b>14:23</b></a></span></td><td><span>When they had ordained them presbyters in every Church - Out of those who were themselves but newly converted. So soon can God enable even a babe in Christ to build up others in the common faith: they commended them to the Lord - An expression implying faith in Christ, as well as love to the brethren.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ac14_25"><b>14:25</b></a></span></td><td><span>Perga and Attalia were cities of Pamphylia.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Ac14_26"><b>14:26</b></a></span></td><td><span>Recommended to the grace - Or favour, of God, for the work which they had fulfilled - This shows the nature and design of that laying on of hands, which was mentioned  <a href="/acts/13-3.html">Acts 13:3</a> .</table><span><!--pageCount=1-->
