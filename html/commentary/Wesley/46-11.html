The head of every man  - Particularly every believer. Is Christ, and the head ofChrist is God - Christ, as he is Mediator, acts in all things subordinately to his Father. But we can no more infer that they are not of the same divine nature, because God is said to be the head of Christ, than that man and woman are not of the same human nature, because the man is said to be the head of the woman.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Co11_4"><b>11:4</b></a></span></td><td><span>Every man praying or prophesying - Speaking by the immediate power of God. With his head - And face. Covered  - Either with a veil or with long hair. Dishonoureth hishead - St. Paul seems to mean, As in these eastern nations veiling the head is a badge of subjection, so a man who prays or prophesies with a veil on his head, reflects a dishonour on Christ, whose representative he is.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Co11_5"><b>11:5</b></a></span></td><td><span>But every woman - Who, under an immediate impulse of the Spirit, (for then only was a woman suffered to speak in the church,) prays or prophesies without a veil on her face, as it were disclaims subjection, and reflects dishonour on man, her head. For it is the same, in effect, as if she cut her hair short, and wore it in the distinguishing form of the men. In those ages, men wore their hair exceeding short, as appears from the ancient statues and pictures.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Co11_6"><b>11:6</b></a></span></td><td><span>Therefore if a woman is not covered - If she will throw off the badge of subjection, let her appear with her hair cut like a man's. But if it be shameful far a woman to appear thus in public, especially in a religious assembly, let her, for the same reason, keep on her veil.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Co11_7"><b>11:7</b></a></span></td><td><span>A man indeed ought not to veil his head, because he is the image of God - In the dominion he bears over the creation, representing the supreme dominion of God, which is his glory. But the woman is only matter of glory to the man, who has a becoming dominion over her. Therefore she ought not to appear, but with her head veiled, as a tacit acknowledgment of it.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Co11_8"><b>11:8</b></a></span></td><td><span>The man is not - In the first production of nature.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Co11_10"><b>11:10</b></a></span></td><td><span>For this cause also a woman ought to be veiled in the public assemblies, because of the angels - Who attend there, and before whom they should be careful not to do anything indecent or irregular.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Co11_11"><b>11:11</b></a></span></td><td><span>Nevertheless in the Lord Jesus, there is neither male nor female - Neither is excluded; neither is preferred before the other in his kingdom.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Co11_12"><b>11:12</b></a></span></td><td><span>And as the woman was at first taken out of the man, so also the man is now, in the ordinary course of nature, by the woman; but all things are of God - The man, the woman, and their dependence on each other.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Co11_13"><b>11:13</b></a></span></td><td><span>Judge of yourselves - For what need of more arguments if so plain a case? Is it decent for a woman to pray to God  - The Most High, with that bold and undaunted air which shemust have, when, contrary to universal custom, she appears in public with her head uncovered?</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Co11_14"><b>11:14</b></a></span></td><td><span>For a man to have long hair, carefully adjusted, is such a mark of effeminacy as is a disgrace to him.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Co11_15"><b>11:15</b></a></span></td><td><span>Given her - Originally, before the arts of dress were in being.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Co11_16"><b>11:16</b></a></span></td><td><span>We have no such custom here, nor any of the other churches of God - The several churches that were in the apostles' time had different customs in things that were not essential; and that under one and the same apostle, as circumstances, in different places, made it convenient. And in all things merely indifferent the custom of each place was of sufficient weight to determine prudent and peaceable men.Yet even this cannot overrule a scrupulous conscience, which really doubts whether the thing be indifferent or no. But those who are referred to here by the apostle were contentious, not conscientious, persons.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Co11_18"><b>11:18</b></a></span></td><td><span>In the church - In the public assembly. I hear there are schisms among you; and I partly believe it - That is, I believe it of some of you. It is plain that by schisms is not meant any separation from the church, but uncharitable divisions in it; for the Corinthians continued to be one church; and, notwithstanding all their strife and contention, there was no separation of any one party from the rest, with regard to external communion. And it is in the same sense that the word is used,  <a href="/1-corinthians/1-10.html">1&nbsp;Corinthians 1:10</a> ;  <a href="/1-corinthians/12-25.html">1&nbsp;Corinthians 12:25</a> ; which are the only places in the New Testament, beside this, where church schisms are mentioned. Therefore, the indulging any temper contrary to this tender care of each other is the true scriptural schism. This is, therefore, a quite different thing from that orderly separation from corrupt churches which later ages have stigmatized as schisms; and have made a pretence for the vilest cruelties, oppressions, and murders, that have troubled the Christian world. Both heresies and schisms are here mentioned in very near the same sense; unless by schisms be meant, rather, those inward animosities which occasion heresies; that is, outward divisions or parties: so that whilst one said, "I am of Paul," another, "I am of Apollos," this implied both schism and heresy. So wonderfully have later ages distorted the words heresy and schism from their scriptural meaning. Heresy is not, in all the Bible, taken for "an error in fundamentals," or in anything else; nor schism, for any separation made from the outward communion of others. Therefore, both heresy and schism, in the modern sense of the words, are sins that the scripture knows nothing of; but were invented merely to deprive mankind of the benefit of private judgment, and liberty of conscience.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Co11_19"><b>11:19</b></a></span></td><td><span>There must be heresies - Divisions. Among you - In the ordinary course of things; and God permits them, that it may appear who among you are, and who are not, upright of heart.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Co11_20"><b>11:20</b></a></span></td><td><span>Therefore - That is, in consequence of those schisms.It is not eating the Lord's supper - That solemn memorial of his death; but quite another thing.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Co11_21"><b>11:21</b></a></span></td><td><span>For in eating what ye call the Lord's supper, instead of all partaking of one bread, each person brings his own supper, and eats it without staying for the rest. And hereby the poor, who cannot provide for themselves, have nothing; while the rich eat and drink to the full just as the heathens use to do at the feasts on their sacrifices.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Co11_22"><b>11:22</b></a></span></td><td><span>Have ye not houses to eat and drink your common meals in? or do ye despise the church of God - Of which the poor are both the larger and the better part.

Take then, and eat of, this bread, in an humble, thankful, obediential remembrance of my dying love; of the extremity of my sufferings on your behalf, of the blessings I have thereby procured for you, and of the obligations to love and duty which I have by all this laid upon you.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="1Co11_25"><b>11:25</b></a></span></td><td><span>After supper - Therefore ye ought not to confound this with a common meal.
