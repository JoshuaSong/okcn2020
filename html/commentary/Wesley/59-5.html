		<span><span><center><b>The Book of James<br>Chapter 5</b></center></span><span><b>Verses:</B></span><br><TABLE WIDTH="100%" CELLPADDING="4" CELLSPACING="0" BORDER="0"><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jas5_1"><b>5:1</b></a></span></td><td><span>Come now, ye rich - The apostle does not speak this so much for the sake of the rich themselves, as of the poor children of God, who were then groaning under their cruel oppression. Weep and howl for your miseries which are coming upon you - Quickly and unexpectedly. This was written not long before the siege of Jerusalem; during which, as well as after it, huge calamities came on the Jewish nation, not only in Judea, but through distant countries. And as these were an awful prelude of that wrath which was to fall upon them in the world to come, so this may likewise refer to the final vengeance which will then be executed on the impenitent.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jas5_2"><b>5:2</b></a></span></td><td><span>The riches of the ancients consisted much in large stores of corn, and of costly apparel.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jas5_3"><b>5:3</b></a></span></td><td><span>The canker of them - Your perishing stores and motheaten garments. Will be a testimony against you - Of your having buried those talents in the earth, instead of improving them according to your Lord's will. And will eat your flesh as fire - Will occasion you as great torment as if fire were consuming your flesh. Ye have laid up treasure in the last days - When it is too late; when you have no time to enjoy them.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jas5_4"><b>5:4</b></a></span></td><td><span>The hire of your labourers crieth - Those sins chiefly cry to God concerning which human laws are silent. Such are luxury, unchastity, and various kinds of injustice. The labourers themselves also cry to God, who is just coming to avenge their cause. Of sabaoth - Of hosts, or armies.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jas5_5"><b>5:5</b></a></span></td><td><span>Ye have cherished your hearts - Have indulged yourselves to the uttermost. As in a day of sacrifice - Which were solemn feast - days among the Jews.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jas5_6"><b>5:6</b></a></span></td><td><span>Ye have killed the just - Many just men; in particular, "that Just One,"  <a href="/acts/3-14.html">Acts 3:14</a> . They afterwards killed James,surnamed the Just, the writer of this epistle. He doth not resist you - And therefore you are secure. But the Lord cometh quickly,  <a href="/james/5-8.html">James 5:8</a> .</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jas5_7"><b>5:7</b></a></span></td><td><span>The husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit - Which will recompense his labour and patience. Till he receives the former rain - Immediately after sowing. And the latter - Before the harvest.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jas5_8"><b>5:8</b></a></span></td><td><span>Stablish your hearts - In faith and patience.For the coming of the Lord - To destroy Jerusalem.Is nigh - And so is his last coming to the eye of a believer.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jas5_9"><b>5:9</b></a></span></td><td><span>Murmur not one against another - Have patience also with each other. The judge standeth before the door - Hearing every word, marking every thought.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jas5_10"><b>5:10</b></a></span></td><td><span>Take the prophets for an example - Once persecuted like you, even for speaking in the name of the Lord. The very men that gloried in having prophets yet could not bear their message: nor did either their holiness or their high commission screen them from suffering.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jas5_11"><b>5:11</b></a></span></td><td><span>We count them happy that endured - That suffered patiently. The more they once suffered, the greater is their present happiness. Ye have seen the end of the Lord  - The end which the Lord gave him.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jas5_12"><b>5:12</b></a></span></td><td><span>Swear not - However provoked. The Jews were notoriously guilty of common swearing, though not so much by God himself as by some of his creatures. The apostle here particularly forbids these oaths, as well as all swearing in common conversation.It is very observable, how solemnly the apostle introduces this command: above all things, swear not - As if he had said, Whatever you forget, do not forget this. This abundantly demonstrates the horrible iniquity of the crime. But he does not forbid the taking a solemn oath before a magistrate. Let your yea be yea; and your nay, nay - Use no higher asseverations in common discourse; and let your word stand firm. Whatever ye say, take care to make it good.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jas5_14"><b>5:14</b></a></span></td><td><span>Having anointed him with oil - This single conspicuous gift, which Christ committed to his apostles,  <a href="/mark/6-13.html"> 6:13</a> , remained in the church long after the other miraculous gifts were withdrawn. Indeed, it seems to have been designed to remain always; and St. James directs the elders, who were the most, if not the only, gifted men, to administer at. This was the whole process of physic in the Christian church, till it was lost through unbelief. That novel invention among the Romanists, extreme unction, practised not for cure, but where life is despaired of, bears no manner of resemblance to this.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jas5_15"><b>5:15</b></a></span></td><td><span>And the prayer offered in faith shall save the sick - From his sickness; and if any sin be the occasion of his sickness, it shall be forgiven him.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jas5_16"><b>5:16</b></a></span></td><td><span>Confess your faults - Whether ye are sick or in health.To one another - He does not say, to the elders: this may, or may not, be done; for it is nowhere commanded. We may confess them to any who can pray in faith: he will then know how to pray for us, and be more stirred up so to do. And pray one for another, that ye may be healed - Of all your spiritual diseases.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jas5_17"><b>5:17</b></a></span></td><td><span>Elijah was a man of like passions - Naturally as weak and sinful as we are. And he prayed - When idolatry covered the land.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jas5_18"><b>5:18</b></a></span></td><td><span>He prayed again - When idolatry was abolished.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jas5_19"><b>5:19</b></a></span></td><td><span>As if he had said, I have now warned you of those sins to which you are most liable; and, in all these respects, watch not only over yourselves, but every one over his brother also. Labour, in particular, to recover those that are fallen.If any one err from the truth - Practically, by sin.</span></td></tr><tr valign=top><td align="right"><span><a name="Jas5_20"><b>5:20</b></a></span></td><td><span>He shall save a soul - Of how much more value than the body!  <a href="/james/5-14.html">James 5:14</a> .And hide a multitude of sins - Which shall no more, how many soever they are, be remembered to his condemnation.</table><!--pageCount=1-->
