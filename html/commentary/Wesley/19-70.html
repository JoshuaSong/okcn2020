For it may sometimes be of use to pray over again the prayers we have  formerly made to God on like occasions. David here prays, that God  would send help to him, shame to his enemies, and joy to his friends.  To the chief musician, a psalm of David, to bring to remembrance. </BLOCKQUOTE><span><!--pageCount=1-->
