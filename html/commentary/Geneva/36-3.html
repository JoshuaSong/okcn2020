Yet he did patiently abide and sent his Prophets continually to call them to repentance, but he profited nothing. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Zep3_6"></a><B><a href="/zephaniah/3-6.html">3:6</a></B> I have <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> cut off the nations: their towers are desolate; I made their streets waste, that none passeth by: their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, that there is none inhabitant. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) By the destruction of other nations he shows that the Jews should have learned to fear God. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Zep3_7"></a><B><a href="/zephaniah/3-7.html">3:7</a></B> I said, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive instruction; so their dwelling should not be cut off, howsoever I punished them: but <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> they rose early, [and] corrupted all their doings. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) They were most earnest and ready to do wickedly. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Zep3_8"></a><B><a href="/zephaniah/3-8.html">3:8</a></B> Therefore <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> wait ye upon me, saith the LORD, until the day that I rise up to the prey: for my determination [is] to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, [even] all my fierce anger: for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) Seeing that you will not repent, you can expect my vengeance as well as other nations. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Zep3_9"></a><B><a href="/zephaniah/3-9.html">3:9</a></B> For <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the LORD, to serve him with one consent. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) Lest any should then think that Gods glory should have perished when Judah was destroyed, he shows that he will proclaim his grace through all the world. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Zep3_10"></a><B><a href="/zephaniah/3-10.html">3:10</a></B> From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, [even] the <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> daughter of my dispersed, shall bring mine offering. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) That is, the Jews will come as well as the Gentiles: which is to be understood as referring to the time of the Gospel. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Zep3_11"></a><B><a href="/zephaniah/3-11.html">3:11</a></B> In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> all thy doings, wherein thou hast transgressed against me: for then I will take away out of the midst of thee them that rejoice in thy pride, and thou shalt no more be haughty because of my holy mountain. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) For they will have full remission of their sins, and the hypocrites who boasted of the temple, which was also your pride in times past, will be taken from you. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Zep3_12"></a><a name="Zep3_13"></a><a name="Zep3_14"></a><a name="Zep3_15"></a><B><a href="/zephaniah/3-15.html">3:15</a></B> The LORD hath taken away thy <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> judgments, he hath cast out thine <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> enemy: the king of Israel, [even] the LORD, [is] in the midst of <SUP><span>m</span></SUP> thee: thou shalt not see evil any more. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) That is, the punishment for your sin. <BR>(<span>l</span>) As the Assyrians, Chaldaeans, Egyptians, and other nations. <BR>(<span>m</span>) To defend you, as by your sins you have put him away, and left yourself naked, as in ( <a href="/exodus/32-25.html">Exodus 32:25</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Zep3_16"></a><a name="Zep3_17"></a><B><a href="/zephaniah/3-17.html">3:17</a></B> The LORD thy God in the midst of thee [is] mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in <SUP><span>n</span></SUP> his love, he will joy over thee with singing. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>n</span>) Signifying, that God delights to show his love and great affection toward his Church. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Zep3_18"></a><B><a href="/zephaniah/3-18.html">3:18</a></B> I will gather [them that are] sorrowful for the solemn assembly, [who] are of thee, [to whom] the reproach of <SUP><span>o</span></SUP> it [was] a burden. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>o</span>) That is, those that were held in hatred and reviled for the Church, and because of their religion. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Zep3_19"></a><B><a href="/zephaniah/3-19.html">3:19</a></B> Behold, at that time I will undo all that afflict thee: and I will <SUP><span>p</span></SUP> save her that halteth, and gather her that was driven out; and I will get them praise and fame in every <SUP><span>q</span></SUP> land where they have been put to shame. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>p</span>) I will deliver the Church, which now is afflicted, as in ( <a href="/micah/4-6.html">Micah 4:6</a> ). <BR>(<span>q</span>) As among the Assyrians and Chaldaeans, who mocked them and put them to shame. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
