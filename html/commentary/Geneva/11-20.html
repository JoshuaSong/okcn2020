behold, I will deliver it into thine hand this day; and thou shalt know <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> that I [am] the LORD. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) Before God went about with signs and miracles to pull Ahab from his impiety, and now again with wonderful victories. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki20_13"</a><a name="1Ki20_14"</a><a name="1Ki20_15"</a><a name="1Ki20_16"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/20-17.html">20:17</a></B> And the <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and Benhadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There are men come out of Samaria. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) That is, young men trained in the service of princes. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki20_17"</a><a name="1Ki20_18"</a><a name="1Ki20_19"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/20-20.html">20:20</a></B> And they slew every one his man: and the Syrians fled; and Israel pursued them: and Benhadad the king of Syria escaped on an horse with the <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> horsemen. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) They who were appointed for the preservation of his person. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki20_20"</a><a name="1Ki20_21"</a><a name="1Ki20_22"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/20-23.html">20:23</a></B> And the servants of the king of Syria said unto him, Their <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> gods [are] gods of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we; but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) Thus the wicked blaspheme God in their fury, who nonetheless he does not permit to go unpunished. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki20_23"</a><a name="1Ki20_24"</a><a name="1Ki20_25"</a><a name="1Ki20_26"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/20-27.html">20:27</a></B> And the children of Israel were numbered, and were all <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> present, and went against them: and the children of Israel pitched before them like two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>l</span>) All those who were in the battle of the previous years, ( <a href="/1-kings/20-15.html">1&nbsp;Kings 20:15</a> ). </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki20_27"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/20-28.html">20:28</a></B> And there came a man of God, and spake unto the king of Israel, and said, Thus saith the LORD, Because the Syrians have said, The LORD [is] God of the hills, but he [is] not God of the valleys, therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into thine hand, and ye shall know that <SUP><span>m</span></SUP> I [am] the LORD. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>m</span>) Who has the same power in the valley as on the hills and can also destroy a multitude with few as with many. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki20_28"</a><a name="1Ki20_29"</a><a name="1Ki20_30"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/20-31.html">20:31</a></B> And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel [are] merciful kings: let us, I pray thee, put sackcloth on our <SUP><span>n</span></SUP> loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of Israel: peradventure he will save thy life. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>n</span>) In sign of submission and that we have deserved death, if he will punish us with rigour. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki20_31"</a><a name="1Ki20_32"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/20-33.html">20:33</a></B> Now the men did diligently observe whether [any thing would come] from him, and did hastily catch [it]: and they said, Thy brother <SUP><span>o</span></SUP> Benhadad. Then he said, Go ye, bring him. Then Benhadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>o</span>) He is alive. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki20_33"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/20-34.html">20:34</a></B> And [Benhadad] said unto him, The cities, which my father took from thy father, I will restore; and thou shalt make streets for thee in <SUP><span>p</span></SUP> Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. Then [said Ahab], I will send thee away with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and sent him away. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>p</span>) You shall appoint in my chief city what you will, and I will obey you. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki20_34"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/20-35.html">20:35</a></B> And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his neighbour in the word of the LORD, <SUP><span>q</span></SUP> Smite me, I pray thee. And the man refused to smite him. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>q</span>) By this external sign he would more likely touch the kings heart. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki20_35"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/20-36.html">20:36</a></B> Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the LORD, behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a lion shall <SUP><span>r</span></SUP> slay thee. And as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and slew him. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>r</span>) Because you have transgressed the commandment of the Lord. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki20_36"</a><a name="1Ki20_37"</a><a name="1Ki20_38"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/20-39.html">20:39</a></B> And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king: and he said, <SUP><span>s</span></SUP> Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and said, Keep this man: if by any means he be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>s</span>) By this parable he makes Ahab condemn himself who made a covenant with Gods enemy, and let him escape whom God had appointed to be slain. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
