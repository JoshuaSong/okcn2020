Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me: for my soul trusteth in thee: yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge, until [these] <SUP><span>a</span></SUP> calamities be overpast. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>a</span>) This was either the beginning of a certain song, or the words which David uttered when he stayed his affection. <BR>(<span>b</span>) He compares the afflictions which God lays on his children, to a storm that comes and goes. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps57_2"></a><B><a href="/psalms/57-2.html">57:2</a></B> I will cry unto God most high; unto God that <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> performeth [all things] for me. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) Who does not leave his works begun imperfectly. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps57_3"></a><B><a href="/psalms/57-3.html">57:3</a></B> He shall send from <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> heaven, and save me [from] the reproach of him that would swallow me up. Selah. God shall send forth his mercy and his truth. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) He would rather deliver me by a miracle, than that I should be overcome. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps57_4"></a><B><a href="/psalms/57-4.html">57:4</a></B> My soul [is] among lions: [and] I lie [even among] them that are set on fire, [even] the sons of men, whose teeth [are] <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) He means their slanderous and false reports. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps57_5"></a><B><a href="/psalms/57-5.html">57:5</a></B> <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; [let] thy glory [be] above all the earth. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) Do not permit me to be destroyed to the contempt of your Name. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps57_6"></a><B><a href="/psalms/57-6.html">57:6</a></B> They have prepared a net for my steps; <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> my soul is bowed down: they have digged a pit before me, into the midst whereof they are fallen [themselves]. Selah. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) For fear, seeing the great dangers on all sides. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps57_7"></a><B><a href="/psalms/57-7.html">57:7</a></B> My heart is <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> I will sing and give praise. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) That is, wholly bent to give you praise for my deliverance. <BR>(<span>i</span>) He shows that both his heart will praise God, and his tongue will confess him, and also he will use other means to provoke himself forward to the same. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps57_8"></a><a name="Ps57_9"></a><a name="Ps57_10"></a><B><a href="/psalms/57-10.html">57:10</a></B> For thy mercy [is] great unto the heavens, and thy truth unto the <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> clouds. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) Your mercies not only belong to the Jews, but also to the Gentiles. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
