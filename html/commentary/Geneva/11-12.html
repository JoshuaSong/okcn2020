So Israel departed unto their tents. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) Though their cause was good, yet it was hard for the people to control their desires, as these vile words declare. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki12_16"</a><a name="1Ki12_17"</a><a name="1Ki12_18"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/12-19.html">12:19</a></B> So Israel rebelled against the house <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> of David unto this day. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) By the just judgment of God for Solomons sins. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki12_19"</a><a name="1Ki12_20"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/12-21.html">12:21</a></B> And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> assembled all the house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) For as yet he did not realize that the Lord had so appointed it. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki12_21"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/12-22.html">12:22</a></B> But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> man of God, saying, <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) That is, the Prophet. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki12_22"</a><a name="1Ki12_23"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/12-24.html">12:24</a></B> Thus saith the <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his house; for this thing is from me. They hearkened therefore to the word of the LORD, and returned to depart, according to the word of the LORD. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) Who of his just judgment will punish the trespasser, and of his mercy spare the innocent people. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki12_24"</a><a name="1Ki12_25"</a><a name="1Ki12_26"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/12-27.html">12:27</a></B> If this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the LORD <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their lord, [even] unto Rehoboam king of Judah, and they shall kill me, and go again to Rehoboam king of Judah. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>l</span>) He feared least his people should have by this means been enticed to rebel against him. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki12_27"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/12-28.html">12:28</a></B> Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves [of] gold, and said unto them, <SUP><span>m</span></SUP> It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>m</span>) So crafty are carnal persuasions of princes, when they will make a religion serve their appetite. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki12_28"</a><a name="1Ki12_29"</a><a name="1Ki12_30"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/12-31.html">12:31</a></B> And he made an <SUP><span>n</span></SUP> house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>n</span>) That is, a temple, where altars were built for idolatry. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki12_31"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/12-32.html">12:32</a></B> And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the <SUP><span>o</span></SUP> fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that [is] in Judah, and he offered upon the altar. So did he in Bethel, sacrificing unto the calves that he had made: and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>o</span>) Because he would bind the peoples devotion to his idolatry even more, he made a new holy day, besides those that the Lord had appointed in the law. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
