And the men went up and viewed Ai. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>b</span>) This was a city of the Amorites: for there was another so called among the Amorites, ( <a href="/jeremiah/49-3.html">Jeremiah 49:3</a> ). The first Ai is called Aiah, ( <a href="/isaiah/10-28.html">Isaiah 10:28</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jos7_3"></a><a name="Jos7_4"></a><a name="Jos7_5"></a><B><a href="/joshua/7-5.html">7:5</a></B> And the <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: for they chased them [from] before the gate [even] unto Shebarim, and smote them in the going down: wherefore the hearts of the people melted, and became as water. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) God would by this overthrow make them more earnest to search out and punish the sin committed. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jos7_6"></a><a name="Jos7_7"></a><B><a href="/joshua/7-7.html">7:7</a></B> And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord GOD, wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? would to God we had been content, and dwelt on the <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> other side Jordan! <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) This infirmity of his faith shows how we are inclined by nature to distrust. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jos7_8"></a><a name="Jos7_9"></a><B><a href="/joshua/7-9.html">7:9</a></B> For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear [of it], and shall environ us round, and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do unto thy great <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> name? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) When your enemies will blaspheme you and say that you were not able to defend us from them. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jos7_10"></a><a name="Jos7_11"></a><a name="Jos7_12"></a><B><a href="/joshua/7-12.html">7:12</a></B> Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies, [but] turned [their] backs before their enemies, because they were accursed: neither will I be with you any more, except ye <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> destroy the accursed from among you. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) Then to allow wickedness unpunished, is to refuse God willingly. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jos7_13"></a><B><a href="/joshua/7-13.html">7:13</a></B> Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow: for thus saith the LORD God of Israel, [There is] an accursed thing in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not stand before thine enemies, until ye take away the <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> accursed thing from among you. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) Meaning, the man that took of the thing forbidden. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jos7_14"></a><a name="Jos7_15"></a><B><a href="/joshua/7-15.html">7:15</a></B> And it shall be, [that] he that is <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> taken with the accursed thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath: because he hath transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he hath wrought folly in Israel. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>h</span>) That is found guilty, either by lots, or by the judgment of Urim.
