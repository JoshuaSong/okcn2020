O LORD, rebuke me not in thy <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>a</span>) To put himself and others in mind of Gods chastisement for sin. <BR>(<span>b</span>) He desires not to be exempted from Gods rod, but that he would so moderate his hand, that he might be able to bear it. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps38_2"></a><B><a href="/psalms/38-2.html">38:2</a></B> For thine <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) Your sickness, with which you have visited me. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps38_3"></a><B><a href="/psalms/38-3.html">38:3</a></B> [There is] no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither [is there any] rest in my bones because of my <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> sin. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) David acknowledges God to be just in his punishments, because his sins had deserved much more. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps38_4"></a><B><a href="/psalms/38-4.html">38:4</a></B> For mine <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) He confesses his sins, Gods justice, and makes prayer his refuge. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps38_5"></a><B><a href="/psalms/38-5.html">38:5</a></B> My wounds stink [and] are corrupt because of <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> my foolishness. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) That rather gave place to my own lusts, than to the will of God. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps38_6"></a><a name="Ps38_7"></a><a name="Ps38_8"></a><B><a href="/psalms/38-8.html">38:8</a></B> I am feeble and sore broken: I <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) This example warns us never to despair, no matter how great the torment: but always to cry to God with sure trust for deliverance. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps38_9"></a><a name="Ps38_10"></a><B><a href="/psalms/38-10.html">38:10</a></B> My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of mine eyes, <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> it also is gone from me. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) My sight fails me for sorrow. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps38_11"></a><B><a href="/psalms/38-11.html">38:11</a></B> My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> kinsmen stand afar off. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) Partly for fear and partly for pride, they denied all duty and friendship. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps38_12"></a><a name="Ps38_13"></a><B><a href="/psalms/38-13.html">38:13</a></B> But I, as a <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> deaf [man], heard not; and [I was] as a dumb man [that] openeth not his mouth. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) For I can have no audience before men, and therefore patiently wait for the help of God. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps38_14"></a><a name="Ps38_15"></a><a name="Ps38_16"></a><B><a href="/psalms/38-16.html">38:16</a></B> For I said, [Hear me], lest [otherwise] they should rejoice over me: <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> when my foot slippeth, they magnify [themselves] against me. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>l</span>) That is, if they see that you do not help me in time, they will mock and triumph as though you had forsaken me. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps38_17"></a><B><a href="/psalms/38-17.html">38:17</a></B> For I [am] ready to <SUP><span>m</span></SUP> halt, and my sorrow [is] continually before me. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>m</span>) I am without hope to recover my strength. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps38_18"></a><a name="Ps38_19"></a><B><a href="/psalms/38-19.html">38:19</a></B> But mine <SUP><span>n</span></SUP> enemies [are] lively, [and] they are strong: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>n</span>) In my greatest misery they most rejoice. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps38_20"></a><B><a href="/psalms/38-20.html">38:20</a></B> They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries; because I follow [the thing that] <SUP><span>o</span></SUP> good [is]. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>o</span>) He would rather have the hatred of all the world, than fail in any part of his duty to God. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps38_21"></a><a name="Ps38_22"></a><B><a href="/psalms/38-22.html">38:22</a></B> Make haste to help me, O Lord my <SUP><span>p</span></SUP> salvation. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>p</span>) Who is the author of my salvation: and this declares that he prayed with sure hope of deliverance. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
