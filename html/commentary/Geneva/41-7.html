And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, [as] the washing of cups, and <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> pots, brasen vessels, and of tables. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) That is to say, after coming from civil and worldly affairs they do not eat unless they first wash themselves. <BR>(<span>e</span>) By these words are understood all types of vessels which we use daily. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mr7_5"></a><B><a href="/mark/7-5.html">7:5</a></B> Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) Why live they not? This is a Hebrew idiom: for among them the "way" is taken for "lifestyle". <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mr7_6"></a><B><a href="/mark/7-6.html">7:6</a></B> <SUP><span>2</span></SUP> He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with [their] lips, but their heart is far from me. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>2</span>) Hypocrisy is always joined with superstition. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mr7_7"></a><B><a href="/mark/7-7.html">7:7</a></B> <SUP><span>3</span></SUP> Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching [for] doctrines the commandments of men. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>3</span>) The more earnest the superstitious are, the more mad they are in promising themselves Gods favour because of their deeds. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mr7_8"></a><B><a href="/mark/7-8.html">7:8</a></B> <SUP><span>4</span></SUP> For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, [as] the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>4</span>) The deeds of superstitious men not only do not fulfil the law of God (as they blasphemously persuaded themselves) but these deeds utterly take away Gods law. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mr7_9"></a><B><a href="/mark/7-9.html">7:9</a></B> <SUP><span>5</span></SUP> And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>5</span>) True religion, which is completely contrary to superstition, consists in spiritual worship: and all enemies of true religion, although they seem to have taken deep root, will be plucked up. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mr7_10"></a><B><a href="/mark/7-10.html">7:10</a></B> For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> die the death: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) Without hope of pardon, he will be put to death. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mr7_11"></a><a name="Mr7_12"></a><a name="Mr7_13"></a><a name="Mr7_14"></a><a name="Mr7_15"></a><a name="Mr7_16"></a><a name="Mr7_17"></a><a name="Mr7_18"></a><a name="Mr7_19"></a><B><a href="/mark/7-19.html">7:19</a></B> Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> purging all meats?
