Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> cry come unto thee. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>a</span>) By which is signified, that even though we are in great misery, yet there is always room for prayer. <BR>(<span>b</span>) He declares that in our prayer we must lively feel that which we desire, and steadfastly believe to obtain. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps102_2"></a><a name="Ps102_3"></a><B><a href="/psalms/102-3.html">102:3</a></B> For my days are <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as an hearth. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) These excessive kinds of speech show how much the affliction of the Church should wound the hearts of the godly. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps102_4"></a><B><a href="/psalms/102-4.html">102:4</a></B> My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> to eat my bread. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) My sorrows were so great that I did not eat. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps102_5"></a><a name="Ps102_6"></a><B><a href="/psalms/102-6.html">102:6</a></B> I am like a <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the desert. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) Always mourning in solitude and casting out fearful cries. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps102_7"></a><a name="Ps102_8"></a><B><a href="/psalms/102-8.html">102:8</a></B> Mine enemies reproach me all the day; [and] they that are mad against me are <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> sworn against me. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) Have conspired my death. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps102_9"></a><B><a href="/psalms/102-9.html">102:9</a></B> For I have <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping, <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) I have not risen out of my mourning to take my refreshment. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps102_10"></a><B><a href="/psalms/102-10.html">102:10</a></B> Because of thine <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) He shows that not only the afflictions moved him, but chiefly the feeling of Gods displeasure. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps102_11"></a><a name="Ps102_12"></a><B><a href="/psalms/102-12.html">102:12</a></B> But thou, O LORD, shalt <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> endure for ever; and thy remembrance unto all generations. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) Though we are frail, yet your promise is sure, and the remembrance of it will confirm us forever. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps102_13"></a><B><a href="/psalms/102-13.html">102:13</a></B> Thou shalt arise, [and] have mercy upon Zion: for the time to favour her, yea, the <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> set time, is come. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>k</span>) That is, the seventy years which by the prophet Jeremiah you appointed, ( <a href="/jeremiah/29-12.html">Jeremiah 29:12</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps102_14"></a><B><a href="/psalms/102-14.html">102:14</a></B> For thy servants take pleasure in her <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> stones, and favour the dust thereof. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>l</span>) The more the Church is in misery and desolation, the more the faithful should love and pity it. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps102_15"></a><a name="Ps102_16"></a><B><a href="/psalms/102-16.html">102:16</a></B> When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear <SUP><span>m</span></SUP> in his glory. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>m</span>) That is, when he will have drawn his church out of the darkness of death. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps102_17"></a><a name="Ps102_18"></a><B><a href="/psalms/102-18.html">102:18</a></B> This shall be written for the generation to come: and the people which shall be <SUP><span>n</span></SUP> created shall praise the LORD. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>n</span>) The deliverance of the Church is an excellent benefit, and therefore he compares it to a new creation for in their banishment the body of the Church seemed to have been dead, which by deliverance was as it were created anew. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps102_19"></a><a name="Ps102_20"></a><B><a href="/psalms/102-20.html">102:20</a></B> To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are <SUP><span>o</span></SUP> appointed to death; <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>o</span>) Who now in their banishment could look for nothing but death. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps102_21"></a><a name="Ps102_22"></a><B><a href="/psalms/102-22.html">102:22</a></B> When the people are gathered <SUP><span>p</span></SUP> together, and the kingdoms, to serve the LORD. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>p</span>) He shows that Gads name is never more praised, than when religion flourishes and the church increases: which is chiefly accomplished under the kingdom of Christ. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps102_23"></a><B><a href="/psalms/102-23.html">102:23</a></B> He <SUP><span>q</span></SUP> weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>q</span>) The church lament that they see not the time of Christ, which was promised, but have but few years and short days. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps102_24"></a><a name="Ps102_25"></a><a name="Ps102_26"></a><B><a href="/psalms/102-26.html">102:26</a></B> <SUP><span>r</span></SUP> They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>r</span>) If heaven and earth perish, much more man will perish: but the Church by reason of Gods promise endures forever. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps102_27"></a><a name="Ps102_28"></a><B><a href="/psalms/102-28.html">102:28</a></B> The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall <SUP><span>s</span></SUP> be established before thee. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>s</span>) Seeing you have chosen your Church out of the world, and joined it to you, it cannot but continue forever: for you are everlasting. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
