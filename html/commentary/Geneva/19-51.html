Have mercy upon me, O God, <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> according to thy lovingkindness: according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>a</span>) To reprove him, because he had committed horrible sins, and lain in the same without repentance more then a whole year. <BR>(<span>b</span>) As his sins were many and great, so he requires that God would give him the feeling of his excellent and abundant mercies. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps51_2"></a><B><a href="/psalms/51-2.html">51:2</a></B> Wash me <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) My sins strike so fast in me, that I have need of some singular kind of washing. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps51_3"></a><B><a href="/psalms/51-3.html">51:3</a></B> For I <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin [is] ever before me. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) My conscience accuses me so, that I can have no rest till I am reconciled. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps51_4"></a><B><a href="/psalms/51-4.html">51:4</a></B> Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done [this] evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> speakest, [and] be clear when thou judgest. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) When you give sentence against sinners, they must confess you to be just, and themselves sinners. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps51_5"></a><a name="Ps51_6"></a><B><a href="/psalms/51-6.html">51:6</a></B> Behold, thou <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden [part] thou shalt make me to know wisdom. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) He confesses that God who loves pureness of heart, may justly destroy man, who by nature is a sinner much more him whom he had instructed in his heavenly wisdom. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps51_7"></a><a name="Ps51_8"></a><B><a href="/psalms/51-8.html">51:8</a></B> Make me to hear <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> joy and gladness; [that] the <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> bones [which] thou hast broken may rejoice. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) He means Gods comfortable mercies toward repentant sinners. <BR>(<span>h</span>) By the bones he understands all strength of soul and body, which by cares and mourning are consumed. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps51_9"></a><a name="Ps51_10"></a><B><a href="/psalms/51-10.html">51:10</a></B> <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) He confesses that when Gods Spirit is cold in us, to have it again revived, is as a new creation. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps51_11"></a><a name="Ps51_12"></a><B><a href="/psalms/51-12.html">51:12</a></B> Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me [with thy] <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> free spirit. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) Which may assure me that I am drawn out of the slavery of sin. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps51_13"></a><B><a href="/psalms/51-13.html">51:13</a></B> [Then] will I teach transgressors thy <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> ways; and sinners shall be converted unto thee. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>l</span>) He promises to endeavour that others by his example may turn to God. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps51_14"></a><B><a href="/psalms/51-14.html">51:14</a></B> Deliver me from <SUP><span>m</span></SUP> bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation: [and] my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>m</span>) From the murder of Uriah and the others who were slain with him, ( <a href="/2-samuel/11-17.html">2&nbsp;Samuel 11:17</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps51_15"></a><B><a href="/psalms/51-15.html">51:15</a></B> O Lord, <SUP><span>n</span></SUP> open thou my lips;
