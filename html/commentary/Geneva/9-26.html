And Abishai said, I will go down with thee. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>b</span>) Who was a stranger, and not an Israelite. <BR>(<span>c</span>) Who afterward was Davids chief captain. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Sa26_6"</a><a name="1Sa26_7"</a><B><a href="/1-samuel/26-8.html">26:8</a></B> Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear even to the earth at once, and I will not [smite] him the <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> second time. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) Meaning, he would make him sure at one stroke. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Sa26_8"</a><B><a href="/1-samuel/26-9.html">26:9</a></B> And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch forth his hand <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> against the LORDS anointed, and be guiltless? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) That is, in his own private cause: for Jehu slew two kings at Gods appointment, ( <a href="/2-kings/9-24.html">2&nbsp;Kings 9:24</a> ). </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Sa26_9"</a><a name="1Sa26_10"</a><a name="1Sa26_11"</a><a name="1Sa26_12"</a><a name="1Sa26_13"</a><a name="1Sa26_14"</a><B><a href="/1-samuel/26-15.html">26:15</a></B> And David said to Abner, [Art] not thou a [valiant] <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> man? and who [is] like to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king? for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) Esteemed most valiant and fit to save the king? </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Sa26_15"</a><a name="1Sa26_16"</a><B><a href="/1-samuel/26-17.html">26:17</a></B> And Saul knew Davids voice, and said, [Is] this thy voice, <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> my son David? And David said, [It is] my voice, my lord, O king. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) By this it appears, that the hypocrite persecuted David against his own conscience and contrary to his promise. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Sa26_17"</a><a name="1Sa26_18"</a><B><a href="/1-samuel/26-19.html">26:19</a></B> Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the LORD have stirred thee up against me, let him <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> accept an offering: but if [they be] the children of men, cursed [be] they before the LORD; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the LORD, saying, Go, serve <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> other gods. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) Let his anger toward us be pacified by a sacrifice. <BR>(<span>i</span>) As much as lay in them, they compelled him to idolatry because they forced him to flee to the idolaters. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Sa26_19"</a><a name="1Sa26_20"</a><B><a href="/1-samuel/26-21.html">26:21</a></B> Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I will no more do thee harm, because my soul was <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> precious in thine eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) Because you saved my life this day. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Sa26_21"</a><a name="1Sa26_22"</a><B><a href="/1-samuel/26-23.html">26:23</a></B> The LORD render to every man his <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> righteousness and his faithfulness: for the LORD delivered thee into [my] hand to day, but I would not stretch forth mine hand against the LORDS anointed. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>l</span>) Thus he protests his innocency toward Saul, not defending his justice in the sight of God, in whose presence none is righteous, ( <a href="/psalms/14-3.html">Psalms 14:3</a>  <a href="/psalms/130-3.html">Psalms 130:3</a> ). </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Sa26_23"</a><a name="1Sa26_24"</a><B><a href="/1-samuel/26-25.html">26:25</a></B> Then Saul said to David, Blessed [be] thou, my son David: thou shalt both do great [things], and also shalt still prevail.
