And Hezekiah <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> wept sore. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>b</span>) Meaning, without all hypocrisy. <BR>(<span>c</span>) Not so much for his own death, as for fear that idolatry would be restored which he had destroyed, and so Gods Name be dishonoured. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki20_3"</a><a name="2Ki20_4"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/20-5.html">20:5</a></B> Turn again, and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee: on the third day thou shalt go up unto the <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> house of the LORD. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) Because of his true repentance and prayer, God turned away his wrath. <BR>(<span>e</span>) To give thanks for your deliverance. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki20_5"</a><a name="2Ki20_6"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/20-7.html">20:7</a></B> And Isaiah said, Take a <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> lump of figs. And they took and laid [it] on the boil, and he recovered. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) He declares that though God can heal without other medicines, he will not have these inferior means contemned. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki20_7"</a><a name="2Ki20_8"</a><a name="2Ki20_9"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/20-10.html">20:10</a></B> And Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees: nay, but let the shadow <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> return backward ten degrees. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) Let the sun go so many degrees back, that the hours may be fewer in the kings dial. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki20_10"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/20-11.html">20:11</a></B> And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the LORD: and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> dial of Ahaz. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) Which was set at the top of the stairs that Ahaz had made. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki20_11"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/20-12.html">20:12</a></B> At that time Berodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> present unto Hezekiah: for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) Moved by the favour that God showed to Hezekiah, and also because he had declared himself an enemy of Sennacherib who was now destroyed. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki20_12"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/20-13.html">20:13</a></B> And Hezekiah hearkened unto them, and shewed them all the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and [all] the house of his armour, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> dominion, that Hezekiah shewed them not. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) Being moved by ambition and vain glory, and also because he seemed to rejoice in the friendship of him who was Gods enemy and an infidel. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki20_13"</a><a name="2Ki20_14"</a><a name="2Ki20_15"</a><a name="2Ki20_16"</a><a name="2Ki20_17"</a><a name="2Ki20_18"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/20-19.html">20:19</a></B> Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Good [is] the word of the LORD which thou hast <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> spoken. And he said, [Is it] not [good], if <SUP><span>m</span></SUP> peace and truth be in my days? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>l</span>) He acknowledges Isaiah to be the true prophet of God and therefore humbles himself to his word. <BR>(<span>m</span>) Seeing that God has shown me this favour to grant me quietness during my life: for he was afraid lest the enemies would have had opportunity to rejoice if the Church had decayed in his time, because he had restored religion. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
