And I answered, I see a flying <SUP><span>a</span></SUP> scroll; its length [is] twenty cubits, and its breadth ten cubits. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>a</span>) Because the Jews had provoked Gods plagues by condemning his word, and casting off all judgment and equity, he shows that Gods curses written in this book had justly happened both to them and their fathers. But now if they would repent, God would send the same among the Chaldeans and their former enemies. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Zec5_3"></a><B><a href="/zechariah/5-3.html">5:3</a></B> Then said he to me, This [is] the curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole earth: for every one that <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> stealeth shall be cut off [as] on this <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> side according to it; and every one that <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> sweareth shall be cut off [as] on that side according to it. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>b</span>) That is, does any injury toward his neighbour. <BR>(<span>c</span>) Meaning, wherever he is in the world. <BR>(<span>d</span>) He that transgresses the first table of the ten commandments, and does not serve God correctly but abuses his name. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Zec5_4"></a><a name="Zec5_5"></a><a name="Zec5_6"></a><B><a href="/zechariah/5-6.html">5:6</a></B> And I said, What [is] it?

He said moreover, This [is] their <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> resemblance through all the earth. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) Which was a measure in dry things, containing about five gallons. <BR>(<span>f</span>) That is, all the wickedness of the ungodly is in Gods sight, which he keeps in a measure, and can shut it or open it at his pleasure. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Zec5_7"></a><B><a href="/zechariah/5-7.html">5:7</a></B> And, behold, there was lifted up a <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> talent of lead: and this [is] a <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> woman that sitteth in the midst of the ephah. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) To cover the measure. <BR>(<span>h</span>) Which represents iniquity, as in the next verse. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Zec5_8"></a><B><a href="/zechariah/5-8.html">5:8</a></B> And he said, This [is] <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> wickedness. And he cast it into the midst of the ephah; and he cast the weight of lead upon its mouth. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) Signifying that Satan would not have such power against the Jews to tempt them, as he had in times past, but that God would shut up iniquity in a measure as in a prison. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Zec5_9"></a><B><a href="/zechariah/5-9.html">5:9</a></B> Then I lifted up my eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came out two <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> women, and the wind [was] in their wings; for they had wings like the wings of a stork: and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heaven. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) Which declared that God would execute his judgment by the means of the weak and infirm. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Zec5_10"></a><a name="Zec5_11"></a><B><a href="/zechariah/5-11.html">5:11</a></B> And he said to me, To build for it an house in the land of <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> Shinar: and it shall be established, and set there upon her own base. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>l</span>) To remove the iniquity and affliction that came from Judah because of the judgment, to place it forever in Babylon. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
