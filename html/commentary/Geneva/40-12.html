<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>a</span>) The Hebrews call it "bread of faces", because it stood before the Lord all the week upon the golden table appointed for that service; ( <a href="/leviticus/24-6.html">Leviticus 24:6</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mt12_5"></a><B><a href="/matthew/12-5.html">12:5</a></B> Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> profane the sabbath, and are blameless?
