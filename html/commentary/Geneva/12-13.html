And he said, The arrow of the LORDS deliverance, and the arrow of deliverance from Syria: for thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek, till thou have consumed [them]. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) That is, toward Syria: so that he not only prophesied with words but also confirmed him by these signs that he would have the victory. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki13_17"</a><a name="2Ki13_18"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/13-19.html">13:19</a></B> And the man of God was <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> wroth with him, and said, Thou shouldest have smitten five or six times; then hadst thou smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed [it]: whereas now thou shalt smite Syria [but] thrice. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) Because he seemed content to have victory against the enemies of God two or three times but did not have the zeal to overcome them continually, and to destroy them completely. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki13_19"</a><a name="2Ki13_20"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/13-21.html">13:21</a></B> And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold, they spied a band [of men]; and they cast the man into the sepulchre of Elisha: and when the man was let down, and touched the bones of Elisha, he <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> revived, and stood up on his feet. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>l</span>) By this miracle God confirmed the authority of Elisha, whose doctrine in his life they contemned, that at this sight they might return and embrace the same doctrine. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki13_21"</a><a name="2Ki13_22"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/13-23.html">13:23</a></B> And the LORD was gracious unto them, and had compassion on them, and had respect unto them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, neither cast he them from his presence as <SUP><span>m</span></SUP> yet. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>m</span>) That is, until their sins were come to a full measure and there was no more hope of amendment. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
