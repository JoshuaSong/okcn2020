(<span>2</span>) The second part of the same statement: The same Son is appointed by the Father to be our king and Lord, by whom also he made all things: and in whom only he sets forth his glory, yea and himself also to be under obligation to us, who upholds and supports all things by his will and pleasure. <BR>(<span>c</span>) Possessor and equal partner of all things with the Father. <BR>(<span>d</span>) That is, whatever has been at any time, is, or shall be. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Heb1_3"></a><B><a href="/hebrews/1-3.html">1:3</a></B> Who being the <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> brightness of [his] glory, and the express image of his <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> person, and <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> upholding all things by the word of his power, <SUP><span>3</span></SUP> when he had by himself purged our sins, <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high; <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) He in whom the glory and majesty of the Father shines, who is otherwise infinite, and cannot be under obligation. <BR>(<span>f</span>) His Fathers person. <BR>(<span>g</span>) Sustains, defends and cherishes. (<span>3</span>) The third part of the same proposition: The same Son executed the office of the High Priest in offering up himself, and is our only and most mighty Mediator in heaven. <BR>(<span>h</span>) This shows that the savour of that his sacrifice is not only most acceptable to the Father, but also is everlasting, and furthermore how far this High Priest surpasses all the other high priests. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Heb1_4"></a><B><a href="/hebrews/1-4.html">1:4</a></B> <SUP><span>4</span></SUP> Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> name than they. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>4</span>) Before he comes to declare the office of Christ, he sets forth the excellency of his person.
