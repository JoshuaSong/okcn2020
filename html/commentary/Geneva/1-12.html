		<span><B><a href="/genesis/12.html">Chapter 12</a></B></span><P><span><a name="Ge12_1"></a><B><a href="/genesis/12-1.html">12:1</a></B> Now the LORD had said unto Abram, <SUP><span>a</span></SUP> Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy fathers house, unto <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> a land that I will shew thee: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>a</span>) From the flood to this time were four hundred and twenty-three years. <BR>(<span>b</span>) In appointing him no certain place, he proves so much more his faith and obedience. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge12_2"></a><B><a href="/genesis/12-2.html">12:2</a></B> And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> a blessing: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) The world shall recover by your seed, which is Christ, the blessing which they lost in Adam. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge12_3"></a><a name="Ge12_4"></a><a name="Ge12_5"></a><B><a href="/genesis/12-5.html">12:5</a></B> And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brothers son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) Meaning servants as well as cattle. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge12_6"></a><B><a href="/genesis/12-6.html">12:6</a></B> And Abram <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> Canaanite [was] then in the land. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) He wandered to and fro in the land before he could find a settling place: thus God exercises the faith of his children. <BR>(<span>f</span>) Which was a cruel and rebellious nation, by whom God kept his in continual exercise. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge12_7"></a><B><a href="/genesis/12-7.html">12:7</a></B> And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto him. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) It was not enough for him to worship God in his heart, but it was expedient to declare by outward profession his faith before men, of which this altar was a sign. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge12_8"></a><B><a href="/genesis/12-8.html">12:8</a></B> And he removed from <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, [having] Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) Because of the troubles that he had among that wicked people. <BR>(<span>i</span>) And so served the true God, and renounced all idolatry. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge12_9"></a><B><a href="/genesis/12-9.html">12:9</a></B> <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) Thus the children of God may look for no rest in this world, but must wait for the heavenly rest and quietness. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge12_10"></a><B><a href="/genesis/12-10.html">12:10</a></B> And there was a <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine [was] grievous in the land. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>l</span>) This was a new trial of Abrams faith: by which we see that the end of one affliction is the beginning of another. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge12_11"></a><a name="Ge12_12"></a><a name="Ge12_13"></a><B><a href="/genesis/12-13.html">12:13</a></B> Say, I pray thee, thou [art] my <SUP><span>m</span></SUP> sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>m</span>) By this we learn not to use unlawful means nor to put others in danger to save ourselves, ( <a href="/genesis/12-20.html">Genesis 12:20</a> ). Though it may appear that Abram did not fear death, so much as dying without children, he acts as though Gods promise had not taken place; in which appeared a weak faith. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge12_14"></a><a name="Ge12_15"></a><B><a href="/genesis/12-15.html">12:15</a></B> The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was <SUP><span>n</span></SUP> taken into Pharaohs house. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>n</span>) To be his wife. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge12_16"></a><a name="Ge12_17"></a><B><a href="/genesis/12-17.html">12:17</a></B> And the LORD <SUP><span>o</span></SUP> plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abrams wife. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>o</span>) The Lord took the defence of this poor stranger against a mighty king: and as he is ever careful over his, so did he preserve Sarai. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge12_18"></a><a name="Ge12_19"></a><a name="Ge12_20"></a><B><a href="/genesis/12-20.html">12:20</a></B> And Pharaoh <SUP><span>p</span></SUP> commanded [his] men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>p</span>) To the intent that none should hurt him either in his person or goods. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
