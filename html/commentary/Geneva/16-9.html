and [another] fourth part they <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> confessed, and worshipped the LORD their God. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>b</span>) They confessed their sins, and used prayers. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ne9_4"></a><a name="Ne9_5"></a><a name="Ne9_6"></a><a name="Ne9_7"></a><a name="Ne9_8"></a><a name="Ne9_9"></a><a name="Ne9_10"></a><a name="Ne9_11"></a><a name="Ne9_12"></a><a name="Ne9_13"></a><a name="Ne9_14"></a><a name="Ne9_15"></a><a name="Ne9_16"></a><a name="Ne9_17"></a><a name="Ne9_18"></a><a name="Ne9_19"></a><a name="Ne9_20"></a><a name="Ne9_21"></a><B><a href="/nehemiah/9-21.html">9:21</a></B> Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness, [so that] they lacked nothing;

for thou hast <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> done right, but we have done wickedly: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) He confesses that all these things came to them justly for their sins, but he appeals from Gods justice to his mercies. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ne9_34"></a><B><a href="/nehemiah/9-34.html">9:34</a></B> Neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept thy law, nor hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies, wherewith thou didst <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> testify against them. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>l</span>) That you would destroy them, unless they would return to you, as in ( <a href="/nehemiah/9-26.html">Nehemiah 9:26</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ne9_35"></a><a name="Ne9_36"></a><B><a href="/nehemiah/9-36.html">9:36</a></B> Behold, we [are] servants this day, and [for] the land that thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the <SUP><span>m</span></SUP> fruit thereof and the good thereof, behold, we [are] servants in it: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>m</span>) That is, to be the Lords. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ne9_37"></a><a name="Ne9_38"></a><B><a href="/nehemiah/9-38.html">9:38</a></B> And because of all this we make <SUP><span>n</span></SUP> a sure [covenant], and write [it];
