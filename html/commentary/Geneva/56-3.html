(Ed.) <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Tit3_4"></a><a name="Tit3_5"></a><B><a href="/titus/3-5.html">3:5</a></B> Not by works of <SUP><span>a</span></SUP> righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> Holy Ghost; <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>a</span>) Literally, "of works which are done in righteousness": and this passage fully refutes the doctrine of meritorious works. <BR>(<span>b</span>) Which the power of the Holy Spirit works. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Tit3_6"></a><a name="Tit3_7"></a><a name="Tit3_8"></a><B><a href="/titus/3-8.html">3:8</a></B> <SUP><span>3</span></SUP> [This is] a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> good works. These things are good and profitable unto men. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>3</span>) Again with great earnestness emphasises how we ought to give ourselves to true godliness and avoid all vain questions, which serve to nothing but to cause strife and debate. <BR>(<span>c</span>) Give themselves earnestly to good works. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Tit3_9"></a><a name="Tit3_10"></a><B><a href="/titus/3-10.html">3:10</a></B> <SUP><span>4</span></SUP> A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject; <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>4</span>) The ministers of the word must at once cast off heretics, that is, those who stubbornly and seditiously disquiet the Church, and will pay no attention to ecclesiastical admonitions. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Tit3_11"></a><a name="Tit3_12"></a><B><a href="/titus/3-12.html">3:12</a></B> <SUP><span>5</span></SUP> When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>5</span>) Last of all, he writes a word or two regarding personal matters, and commends certain men. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
