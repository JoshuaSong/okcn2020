And Asa oppressed [some] of the people the same time. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) Thus instead of turning to God in repentance, he disdained the admonition of the prophet, and punished him, as the wicked do when they are told of their faults. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ch16_10"</a><a name="2Ch16_11"</a><B><a href="/2-chronicles/16-12.html">16:12</a></B> And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet, until his disease [was] <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> exceeding [great]: yet in his disease he sought not to the LORD, but to the <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> physicians. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) God plagued his rebellion and by this declared that it is nothing to begin well, unless we continue to the end, that is, zealous of Gods glory and put our whole trust in him. <BR>(<span>f</span>) He shows that it is useless to seek the physicians unless we first seek God to purge our sins, which are the chief cause of all our diseases, and later use the help of the physicians as a means by which God works. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
