Then said the kings servants that ministered unto him, There is nothing done for him. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>a</span>) For he thought it unworthy of his estate to receive a benefit and not reward it. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Es6_4"></a><B><a href="/esther/6-4.html">6:4</a></B> And the king said, Who [is] in the court?
