		<span><B><a href="/john/12.html">Chapter 12</a></B></span><P><span><a name="Joh12_1"></a><a name="Joh12_2"></a><a name="Joh12_3"></a><a name="Joh12_4"></a><a name="Joh12_5"></a><B><a href="/john/12-5.html">12:5</a></B> <SUP><span>1</span></SUP> Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>1</span>) A horrible example in Judas of a mind blinded with covetousness, and yet pretending godliness. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Joh12_6"></a><a name="Joh12_7"></a><B><a href="/john/12-7.html">12:7</a></B> <SUP><span>2</span></SUP> Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>2</span>) This extraordinary anointing, which was a sign, is allowed by God so that he may witness that he will not be worshipped with outward pomp or costly service, but with alms. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Joh12_8"></a><a name="Joh12_9"></a><B><a href="/john/12-9.html">12:9</a></B> <SUP><span>3</span></SUP> Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>3</span>) When the light of the gospel shows itself, some are found to be curious, and others are found to be open enemies (and these latter ones should be the least opposed to the gospel): others fervently honour him whom they will immediately fall away from, and very few receive him as reverently as they ought to. Nonetheless, Christ begins his spiritual kingdom in the midst of his enemies. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Joh12_10"></a><a name="Joh12_11"></a><a name="Joh12_12"></a><a name="Joh12_13"></a><a name="Joh12_14"></a><a name="Joh12_15"></a><a name="Joh12_16"></a><a name="Joh12_17"></a><a name="Joh12_18"></a><a name="Joh12_19"></a><B><a href="/john/12-19.html">12:19</a></B> <SUP><span>4</span></SUP> The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>4</span>) Even they who go about to oppress Christ are made instruments of his glory. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Joh12_20"></a><B><a href="/john/12-20.html">12:20</a></B> And there were certain Greeks among them that <SUP><span>a</span></SUP> came up to worship at the feast: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>a</span>) After the solemn custom: the Greeks were first so called by the name of the country of Greece, where they lived: but afterward, all that were not of the Jews religion, but worshipped false gods and were also called heathens, were called by the name Greeks. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Joh12_21"></a><a name="Joh12_22"></a><a name="Joh12_23"></a><a name="Joh12_24"></a><B><a href="/john/12-24.html">12:24</a></B> <SUP><span>5</span></SUP> Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>5</span>) The death of Christ is as it were a sowing, which seems to be a dying of the corn, but indeed is the cause of a much greater harvest: and such as is the condition of the head, so will be the condition of the members. <BR>(<span>b</span>) A wheat corn dies when it is changed in the ground, and becomes the root of a fruitful new plant. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Joh12_25"></a><a name="Joh12_26"></a><a name="Joh12_27"></a><B><a href="/john/12-27.html">12:27</a></B> <SUP><span>6</span></SUP> Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>6</span>) While Christ went about to suffer all the punishment which is due to our sins, and while his divinity did not yet show his might and power so that the satisfaction might be fully accomplished, he is stricken with the great fear of the curse of God, and so he cries and prays, and desires to be released: yet nonetheless he prefers the will and glory of his Father before all things, and his Father allows this obedience even from heaven. <BR>(<span>c</span>) That is, of death which is now at hand. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Joh12_28"></a><B><a href="/john/12-28.html">12:28</a></B> Father, <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, [saying], I have both glorified [it], and will glorify [it] again. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) So then the Fathers glory is Christs glory. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Joh12_29"></a><a name="Joh12_30"></a><B><a href="/john/12-30.html">12:30</a></B> <SUP><span>7</span></SUP> Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>7</span>) Christ foretells to the deaf the manner of his death, the overcoming of the devil and the world, and in conclusion his triumph. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Joh12_31"></a><a name="Joh12_32"></a><B><a href="/john/12-32.html">12:32</a></B> And I, if I be <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> lifted up from the earth, will draw <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> all [men] unto me. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) Christ used a word which has a double meaning, for it signifies either to lift up or to get out of the way: for he intended them to think of his death, but the Jews seemed to take it another way. <BR>(<span>f</span>) Chrysostom and Theophylact say that this word "all" refers to all nations: that is, not only to the Jews. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Joh12_33"></a><a name="Joh12_34"></a><a name="Joh12_35"></a><B><a href="/john/12-35.html">12:35</a></B> <SUP><span>8</span></SUP> Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>8</span>) Unmeasurable is the mercy of God, but a horrible judgment follows if it is condemned. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Joh12_36"></a><B><a href="/john/12-36.html">12:36</a></B> While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) That is, partakers of light. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Joh12_37"></a><B><a href="/john/12-37.html">12:37</a></B> <SUP><span>9</span></SUP> But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>9</span>) Faith is not of nature, but of grace. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Joh12_38"></a><B><a href="/john/12-38.html">12:38</a></B> That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> arm of the Lord been revealed? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) The arm of the Lord is the gospel, which is the power of God to salvation to all that believe, and therefore the arm of the Lord is not revealed to those whose hearts the Lord has not opened. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Joh12_39"></a><a name="Joh12_40"></a><a name="Joh12_41"></a><a name="Joh12_42"></a><B><a href="/john/12-42.html">12:42</a></B> <SUP><span>10</span></SUP> Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess [him], lest they should be put out of the synagogue: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>10</span>) The ones who believe are not only few in number, if they are compared with the unbelievers, but also the majority of those few (yea, and especially the ones of highest rank) fear men more than God. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Joh12_43"></a><a name="Joh12_44"></a><B><a href="/john/12-44.html">12:44</a></B> <SUP><span>11</span></SUP> Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> not on me, but on him that sent me. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>11</span>) The sum of the gospel, and therefore of salvation, which Christ witnessed in the midst of Jerusalem by his crying out, is this: to rest upon Christ through faith as the only Saviour appointed and given us by the Father. <BR>(<span>i</span>) This word "not" does not take anything away from Christ which is spoken of here, but is rather spoken in way of correction, as if he said, "He that believes in me does not so much believe in me as in him that sent me." So is it in ( <a href="/mark/9-37.html">Mark 9:37</a> ). <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
