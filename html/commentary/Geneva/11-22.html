And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> I [am] as thou [art], my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) I am ready to join and go with you , and all of mine is at your command. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki22_4"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/22-5.html">22:5</a></B> And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD to day. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) He seemed that he would not go to war unless God approved it, yet when Michaiah advised the opposite he would not obey. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki22_5"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/22-6.html">22:6</a></B> Then the king of Israel gathered the <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the Lord shall deliver [it] into the hand of the king. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) Meaning the false prophets, who were liars and served for money whom Jezebel had assembled and kept after the death of those whom Elijah slew. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki22_6"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/22-7.html">22:7</a></B> And Jehoshaphat said, [Is there] not here a prophet of the <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> LORD besides, that we might enquire of him? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) Jehoshaphat did not acknowledge the false prophets to be Gods ministers, but contemned them. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki22_7"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/22-8.html">22:8</a></B> And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, [There is] yet one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) By which we see that the wicked cannot abide to hear the truth, but hate the prophets of God and molest them. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki22_8"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/22-9.html">22:9</a></B> Then the king of Israel called an <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> officer, and said, Hasten [hither] Micaiah the son of Imlah. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) Read ( <a href="/genesis/37-36.html">Genesis 37:36</a> ). </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki22_9"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/22-10.html">22:10</a></B> And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, having put on their <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> robes, in a void place in the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) In their kingly apparel. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki22_10"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/22-11.html">22:11</a></B> And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> horns of iron: and he said, Thus saith the LORD, With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until thou have consumed them. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) The true prophets of God were accustomed to use signs for the confirmation of their doctrine, ( <a href="/isaiah/20-2.html">Isaiah 20:2</a> ;  <a href="/jeremiah/7-2.html">Jeremiah 7:2</a> ) in which the false prophets imitated them, thinking by it to make their doctrine more believable. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki22_11"</a><a name="1Ki22_12"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/22-13.html">22:13</a></B> And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spake unto him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets [declare] good unto the king with <SUP><span>m</span></SUP> one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak [that which is] good. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>m</span>) This is the common argument of the wicked, who think that no one should speak against anything if the majority approves of it, be they ever so ungodly. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki22_13"</a><a name="1Ki22_14"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/22-15.html">22:15</a></B> So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered him, <SUP><span>n</span></SUP> Go, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver [it] into the hand of the king. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>n</span>) He speaks this in derision, because the king attributed so much to the false prophets, meaning that by experience he should discern that they were liars. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki22_15"</a><a name="1Ki22_16"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/22-17.html">22:17</a></B> And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, as sheep that have not a shepherd: and the LORD said, <SUP><span>o</span></SUP> These have no master: let them return every man to his house in peace. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>o</span>) It is better for them to return home than to be punished and scattered because they go to war without Gods counsel and approval. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki22_17"</a><a name="1Ki22_18"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/22-19.html">22:19</a></B> And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the <SUP><span>p</span></SUP> host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>p</span>) Meaning, his angels. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki22_19"</a><a name="1Ki22_20"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/22-21.html">22:21</a></B> And there came forth a spirit, and <SUP><span>q</span></SUP> stood before the LORD, and said, I will persuade him. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>q</span>) Here we see that though the devil is always ready to bring us to destruction, yet he has no more power than God gives him. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki22_21"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/22-22.html">22:22</a></B> And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go forth, and I will be a <SUP><span>r</span></SUP> lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt persuade [him], and prevail also: go forth, and do so. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>r</span>) I will cause all his prophets to tell lies. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki22_22"</a><a name="1Ki22_23"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/22-24.html">22:24</a></B> But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, <SUP><span>s</span></SUP> Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>s</span>) Thus the wicked would that none were in the favour of God but they, and that God has given his graces to none so much as to them. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki22_24"</a><a name="1Ki22_25"</a><a name="1Ki22_26"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/22-27.html">22:27</a></B> And say, Thus saith the king, Put this [fellow] in the prison, and feed him with <SUP><span>t</span></SUP> bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>t</span>) Let him waste away with hunger and be fed with a small portion of bread and water. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki22_27"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/22-28.html">22:28</a></B> And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, the LORD hath not spoken by me.
