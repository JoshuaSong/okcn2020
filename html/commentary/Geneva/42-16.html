Ye cannot serve God and mammon. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>3</span>) No man can love God and riches simultaneously. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu16_14"></a><a name="Lu16_15"></a><B><a href="/luke/16-15.html">16:15</a></B> <SUP><span>4</span></SUP> And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>4</span>) Our sins are not hidden to God, although they may be hidden to men, yea although they may be hidden to those who committed them. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu16_16"></a><B><a href="/luke/16-16.html">16:16</a></B> <SUP><span>5</span></SUP> The law and the prophets [were] until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>5</span>) The Pharisees despised the excellency of the new covenant with respect to the old, being ignorant of the perfect righteousness of the law; and Christ declares by the seventh commandment how they were false expounders of the law. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu16_17"></a><a name="Lu16_18"></a><B><a href="/luke/16-18.html">16:18</a></B> Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> that is put away from [her] husband committeth adultery. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) They that gather by this passage that a man cannot be married again after he has divorced his wife for adultery, while she lives, reason incorrectly: for Christ speaks of those divorces which the Jews had which were not because of adultery, for adulterers were put to death by the law. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu16_19"></a><B><a href="/luke/16-19.html">16:19</a></B> <SUP><span>6</span></SUP> There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>6</span>) The end of the poverty and misery of the godly will be everlasting joy, as the end of riotous living and the cruel pride of the rich will be everlasting misery, without any hope of mercy. <BR>(<span>h</span>) Very gorgeously and sumptuously, for purple garments were costly, and this fine linen, which was a kind of linen that came out of Achaia, was as precious as gold. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu16_20"></a><a name="Lu16_21"></a><a name="Lu16_22"></a><a name="Lu16_23"></a><B><a href="/luke/16-23.html">16:23</a></B> And in hell <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) Heavenly and spiritual things are expressed and set forth using language fit for our senses. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu16_24"></a><a name="Lu16_25"></a><a name="Lu16_26"></a><a name="Lu16_27"></a><B><a href="/luke/16-27.html">16:27</a></B> <SUP><span>7</span></SUP> Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my fathers house: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>7</span>) Seeing that we have a most sure rule to live by, laid forth for us in the word of God, men seek rashly and vainly for other revelations. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
