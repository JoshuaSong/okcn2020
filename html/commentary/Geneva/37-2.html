And the priests answered and said, No. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) That is, the flesh of the sacrifices, by which he means that a thing which of itself is good, cannot make another thing so: and therefore they ought not to justify themselves by their sacrifices and ceremonies: but contrary to this, he that is unclean and not pure of heart, does corrupt those things and make them detestable to God, which otherwise are good and godly. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Hag2_13"></a><a name="Hag2_14"></a><a name="Hag2_15"></a><B><a href="/haggai/2-15.html">2:15</a></B> And now, I pray you, consider from this <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> day and upward, from before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the LORD: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) Consider how God plagued you with famine before you began to build the temple. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Hag2_16"></a><B><a href="/haggai/2-16.html">2:16</a></B> <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> Since those [days] were, when [one] came to an heap of twenty [measures], there were [but] ten: when [one] came to the pressfat for to draw out fifty [vessels] out of the press, there were [but] twenty. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) That is, before the building was begun. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Hag2_17"></a><a name="Hag2_18"></a><B><a href="/haggai/2-18.html">2:18</a></B> Consider now from <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> this day and upward, from the four and twentieth day of the ninth [month, even] from the day that the foundation of the LORDS temple was laid, consider [it]. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) From the time they began to build the temple, he promises that God would bless them: and even though the fruit has not yet come forth, yet in the gathering they would have plenty. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Hag2_19"></a><B><a href="/haggai/2-19.html">2:19</a></B> Is the <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> seed yet in the barn? yea, as yet the vine, and the fig tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive tree, hath not brought forth: from this day will I bless [you]. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>l</span>) He exhorts them to have patience, and to remain until the harvest came, and then they would see Gods blessings. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Hag2_20"></a><a name="Hag2_21"></a><B><a href="/haggai/2-21.html">2:21</a></B> Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I <SUP><span>m</span></SUP> will shake the heavens and the earth; <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>m</span>) I will make a change, and renew all things in Christ, of whom Zerubbabel is here a figure. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Hag2_22"></a><B><a href="/haggai/2-22.html">2:22</a></B> And I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the <SUP><span>n</span></SUP> kingdoms of the heathen; and I will overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them; and the horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the sword of his brother. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>n</span>) By this he shows that there will be no stop or hindrance, when God will make this wonderful restitution of his Church. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Hag2_23"></a><B><a href="/haggai/2-23.html">2:23</a></B> In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, will I take thee, O Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel, saith the LORD, and will make thee as a <SUP><span>o</span></SUP> signet: for I have chosen thee, saith the LORD of hosts. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>o</span>) Signifying that his dignity would be most excellent, which thing was accomplished in Christ. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
