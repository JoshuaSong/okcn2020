		<span><B><a href="/2-kings/5.html">Chapter 5</a></B></span><P><span> <B><a href="/2-kings/5-1.html">5:1</a></B> Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honourable, because by him the LORD had given <SUP><span>a</span></SUP> deliverance unto Syria: he was also a mighty man in valour, [but he was] a leper. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>a</span>) Here it appears that among the infidels God has his, and also that the infidels esteem those who do good to their country. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki5_1"</a><a name="2Ki5_2"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/5-3.html">5:3</a></B> And she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord [were] with the <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> prophet that [is] in Samaria! for he would recover him of his leprosy. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>b</span>) Meaning Elisha. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki5_3"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/5-4.html">5:4</a></B> And <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> [one] went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the maid that [is] of the land of Israel. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) That is, Naaman told it to the king of Syria. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki5_4"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/5-5.html">5:5</a></B> And the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel. And he departed, and <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand [pieces] of gold, and ten changes of raiment. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) To give this as a present to the prophets. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki5_5"</a><a name="2Ki5_6"</a><a name="2Ki5_7"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/5-8.html">5:8</a></B> And it was [so], when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) The prophet rebukes the king because he did not consider that God was true in his promise, and therefore would not leave his Church destitute of a prophet, whose prayers he would hear, and to whom others could have recourse for comfort. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki5_8"</a><a name="2Ki5_9"</a><a name="2Ki5_10"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/5-11.html">5:11</a></B> But Naaman was <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the LORD his God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the leper. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) Mans reason murmurs when it considers only the signs and outward things, and has no regard for the word of God, which is contained there. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki5_11"</a><a name="2Ki5_12"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/5-13.html">5:13</a></B> And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> My father, [if] the prophet had bid thee [do some] great thing, wouldest thou not have done [it]? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) This declares that servants should reverence and love their masters as children their fathers, and likewise masters toward their servants, must be affectioned as toward their children. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki5_13"</a><a name="2Ki5_14"</a><a name="2Ki5_15"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/5-16.html">5:16</a></B> But he said, [As] the LORD liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to take [it]; <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> but he refused. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) So the Lord commands that they that receive freely, should also give freely. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki5_16"</a><a name="2Ki5_17"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/5-18.html">5:18</a></B> In this thing the LORD <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> pardon thy servant, [that] when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon: when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon thy servant in this thing. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) He feels his conscience is wounded by being present at idols service, and therefore desires God to forgive him, lest others by his example might fall to idolatry: for as for his own part he confesses that he will never serve any but the true God. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki5_18"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/5-19.html">5:19</a></B> And he said unto him, <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> Go in peace. So he departed from him a little way. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) The prophet did not approve his act, but after the common manner of speech he bids him farewell. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki5_19"</a><a name="2Ki5_20"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/5-21.html">5:21</a></B> So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw [him] running after him, <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> he lighted down from the chariot to meet him, and said, [Is] all well? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>l</span>) Declaring by it, the honour and affection he bore to the prophet his master. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki5_21"</a><a name="2Ki5_22"</a><a name="2Ki5_23"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/5-24.html">5:24</a></B> And when he came to the tower, he took [them] from their hand, and bestowed [them] in the house: and he let the men go, and <SUP><span>m</span></SUP> they departed. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>m</span>) Naamans servants. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki5_24"</a><a name="2Ki5_25"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/5-26.html">5:26</a></B> And he said unto him, <SUP><span>n</span></SUP> Went not mine heart [with thee], when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee? [Is it] a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and <SUP><span>o</span></SUP> oliveyards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>n</span>) Was I not present with you in spirit? <BR>(<span>o</span>) That is, money to buy possessions with: meaning that it is detestable in the servants of God to have covetous minds. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki5_26"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/5-27.html">5:27</a></B> The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy <SUP><span>p</span></SUP> seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper [as white] as snow. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>p</span>) To be an example to all, by whose covetousness Gods word might be slandered. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
