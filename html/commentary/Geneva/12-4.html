And she said, Thine handmaid hath not any thing in the house, save a <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> pot of oil. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) Thus God permits his to be brought many times to extreme necessity, before he helps them, that afterward they may praise his mercy even more. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki4_2"</a><a name="2Ki4_3"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/4-4.html">4:4</a></B> And when thou art come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and shalt pour out into <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> all those vessels, and thou shalt set aside that which is full. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) The Prophet declares by this to her, that God never fails to provide for his servants, their wives and children, it they trust in him. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki4_4"</a><a name="2Ki4_5"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/4-6.html">4:6</a></B> And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her, [There is] not a vessel more. And the oil <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> stayed. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) Or ceased to increase. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki4_6"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/4-7.html">4:7</a></B> Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy children of the <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> rest. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) God here not only provided for his servant, that his debts should be paid and so kept his doctrine and profession without slander, but also for his wife and children. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki4_7"</a><a name="2Ki4_8"</a><a name="2Ki4_9"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/4-10.html">4:10</a></B> Let us make a <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick: and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in thither. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) Which would be separate from the rest of the house, that he might more conveniently give himself to study and prayers. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki4_10"</a><a name="2Ki4_11"</a><a name="2Ki4_12"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/4-13.html">4:13</a></B> And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this care; <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> what [is] to be done for thee? wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she answered, I <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> dwell among mine own people. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) Thus the servants of God are not unthankful for the benefits they receive. <BR>(<span>k</span>) I am content with what God has sent me, and can lack nothing that one can do for another. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki4_13"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/4-14.html">4:14</a></B> And he said, What then [is] to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Verily she hath <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> no child, and her husband is old. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>l</span>) Which was shameful and therefore he would that his master should pray to God for her that she might be fruitful. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki4_14"</a><a name="2Ki4_15"</a><a name="2Ki4_16"</a><a name="2Ki4_17"</a><a name="2Ki4_18"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/4-19.html">4:19</a></B> And he said unto his father, <SUP><span>m</span></SUP> My head, my head. And he said to a lad, Carry him to his mother. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>m</span>) His head was hurt badly and therefore he cried. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki4_19"</a><a name="2Ki4_20"</a><a name="2Ki4_21"</a><a name="2Ki4_22"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/4-23.html">4:23</a></B> And he said, Wherefore wilt thou go to him to day? [it is] neither <SUP><span>n</span></SUP> new moon, nor sabbath. And she said, [It shall be] well. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>n</span>) For at such times the people were wont to resort to the prophets for doctrine and consolation. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki4_23"</a><a name="2Ki4_24"</a><a name="2Ki4_25"</a><a name="2Ki4_26"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/4-27.html">4:27</a></B> And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she <SUP><span>o</span></SUP> caught him by the feet: but Gehazi came near to thrust her away. And the man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul [is] vexed within her: and the LORD hath hid [it] from me, and hath not told me. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>o</span>) In token of humility and joy that she had met with him. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki4_27"</a><a name="2Ki4_28"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/4-29.html">4:29</a></B> Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thine hand, and go thy way: <SUP><span>p</span></SUP> if thou meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not again: and lay my staff upon the face of the child. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>p</span>) Make such speed that nothing may stop you in the way, ( <a href="/luke/10-4.html">Luke 10:4</a> ). </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki4_29"</a><a name="2Ki4_30"</a><a name="2Ki4_31"</a><a name="2Ki4_32"</a><a name="2Ki4_33"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/4-34.html">4:34</a></B> And he went up, and <SUP><span>q</span></SUP> lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and he stretched himself upon the child; and the flesh of the child waxed warm. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>q</span>) Elijah did the same to the widows son at Zarephath ( <a href="/1-kings/17-21.html">1&nbsp;Kings 17:21</a> ) and Paul in ( <a href="/acts/20-10.html">Acts 20:10</a> ) signifying the care that should be in them, who bear the word of God and are distributors of spiritual life. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki4_34"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/4-35.html">4:35</a></B> Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed <SUP><span>r</span></SUP> seven times, and the child opened his eyes. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>r</span>) Meaning, often. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki4_35"</a><a name="2Ki4_36"</a><a name="2Ki4_37"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/4-38.html">4:38</a></B> And Elisha came again to Gilgal: and [there was] a dearth in the <SUP><span>s</span></SUP> land; and the sons of the prophets [were] sitting before him: and he said unto his servant, Set on the great pot, and seethe pottage for the sons of the prophets. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>s</span>) That is, in the land of Israel. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki4_38"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/4-39.html">4:39</a></B> And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a <SUP><span>t</span></SUP> wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred [them] into the pot of pottage: for they knew [them] not. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>t</span>) Which the apothecaries call colloquintida, and is most vehement and dangerous in purging. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki4_39"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/4-40.html">4:40</a></B> So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O [thou] man of God, [there is] <SUP><span>u</span></SUP> death in the pot.
