 <a href="/revelation/10-10.html">Revelation 10:10</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Eze3_2"></a><a name="Eze3_3"></a><a name="Eze3_4"></a><a name="Eze3_5"></a><a name="Eze3_6"></a><a name="Eze3_7"></a><a name="Eze3_8"></a><B><a href="/ezekiel/3-8.html">3:8</a></B> Behold, I have made thy <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>b</span>) God promises his assistance to his ministers, and that he will give them boldness and constancy in their calling, ( <a href="/isaiah/50-7.html">Isaiah 50:7</a> ;  <a href="/jeremiah/1-18.html">Jeremiah 1:18</a> ;  <a href="/micah/3-8.html">Micah 3:8</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Eze3_9"></a><a name="Eze3_10"></a><B><a href="/ezekiel/3-10.html">3:10</a></B> Moreover he said to me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak to thee <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> receive in thy heart, and hear with thy ears. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) He shows what is meant by the eating of the book, which is that the ministers of God may speak nothing from themselves, but only that which they have received from the Lord. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Eze3_11"></a><a name="Eze3_12"></a><B><a href="/ezekiel/3-12.html">3:12</a></B> Then the spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, [saying], <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> Blessed [be] the glory of the LORD from his place. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) By which he signifies that Gods glory would not be diminished, although he departed out of his temple, for this declared that the city and temple would be destroyed. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Eze3_13"></a><a name="Eze3_14"></a><B><a href="/ezekiel/3-14.html">3:14</a></B> So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) This shows that there is always an infirmity of the flesh which can never be ready to render full obedience to God, and also Gods grace who ever assists his, and overcomes their rebellious affections. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Eze3_15"></a><B><a href="/ezekiel/3-15.html">3:15</a></B> Then I came to them of the captivity at <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> Telabib, that dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there overwhelmed among them <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> seven days. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) Which was a place by Euphrates where the Jews were prisoners. <BR>(<span>g</span>) Declaring here that Gods ministers must with advisement and deliberation utter his judgments. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Eze3_16"></a><a name="Eze3_17"></a><B><a href="/ezekiel/3-17.html">3:17</a></B> Son of man, I have made thee a <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> watchman to the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>h</span>) Of this read ( <a href="/ezekiel/33-2.html">Ezekiel 33:2</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Eze3_18"></a><a name="Eze3_19"></a><a name="Eze3_20"></a><B><a href="/ezekiel/3-20.html">3:20</a></B> Again, When a <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> righteous [man] doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thy hand. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) If he that has been instructed in the right way turn back. <BR>(<span>k</span>) I will give him up to a reprobate mind, ( <a href="/romans/1-28.html">Romans 1:28</a> ). <BR>(<span>l</span>) Which seemed to have been done in faith, and was not. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Eze3_21"></a><a name="Eze3_22"></a><B><a href="/ezekiel/3-22.html">3:22</a></B> And the <SUP><span>m</span></SUP> hand of the LORD was there upon me;
