[It is a] good [thing] to give thanks unto the LORD, and to sing praises unto thy name, O most High: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>a</span>) Which teaches that the use of the Sabbath stands in praising God, and not only in ceasing from work. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps92_2"></a><B><a href="/psalms/92-2.html">92:2</a></B> To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> morning, and thy faithfulness every night, <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>b</span>) For Gods mercy and fidelity in his promises toward his, bind them to praise him continually both day and night. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps92_3"></a><B><a href="/psalms/92-3.html">92:3</a></B> Upon an <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon the harp with a solemn sound. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) These instruments were then permitted in the Church as also they are now. (Ed.) <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps92_4"></a><B><a href="/psalms/92-4.html">92:4</a></B> For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) He shows the use of the Sabbath day: that is, to meditate Gods works. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps92_5"></a><a name="Ps92_6"></a><B><a href="/psalms/92-6.html">92:6</a></B> A <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand this. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) That is, the wicked do not consider Gods works nor his judgments against them, and therefore most justly perish. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps92_7"></a><a name="Ps92_8"></a><B><a href="/psalms/92-8.html">92:8</a></B> But thou, LORD, [art <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> most] high for evermore. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) Your judgments are most constant against the wicked and pass our reach. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps92_9"></a><a name="Ps92_10"></a><B><a href="/psalms/92-10.html">92:10</a></B> <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> But my horn shalt thou exalt like [the horn of] an unicorn: I shall be anointed with fresh oil. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) You will strengthen them with all power, and bless them with all happiness. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps92_11"></a><a name="Ps92_12"></a><B><a href="/psalms/92-12.html">92:12</a></B> The righteous shall <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) Though the faithful seem to whither and be cut down by the wicked, yet they will grow again and flourish in the Church of God as the cedars do in mount Lebanon. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps92_13"></a><a name="Ps92_14"></a><B><a href="/psalms/92-14.html">92:14</a></B> They shall still bring forth fruit in old <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> age; they shall be fat and flourishing; <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) The children of God will have a power above nature and their age will bring forth fresh fruit. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
