When his branch is yet <SUP><span>s</span></SUP> tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer [is] nigh: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>7</span>) If God has prescribed a certain order to nature, much more has he done so to his eternal judgments; but the wicked do not understand it, or rather they mock it: but the godly make note of it, and wait for it. <BR>(<span>s</span>) When its tenderness shows that the sap which is the life of the tree has come from the roots into the bark. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mt24_33"></a><a name="Mt24_34"></a><B><a href="/matthew/24-34.html">24:34</a></B> Verily I say unto you, This <SUP><span>t</span></SUP> generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>t</span>) This age: the word "generation" or "age" is here being used for the men of this age. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mt24_35"></a><B><a href="/matthew/24-35.html">24:35</a></B> <SUP><span>8</span></SUP> Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>8</span>) The Lord now begins the judgment, which he will finish in the latter days. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mt24_36"></a><B><a href="/matthew/24-36.html">24:36</a></B> <SUP><span>9</span></SUP> But of that day and hour knoweth no [man], no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>9</span>) It is sufficient for us to know that God has appointed a latter day for the restoring of all things; but when it will be is hidden from us all for our sake, so that we may be all the more watchful, so that we are not taken as those were taken in the flood years ago. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mt24_37"></a><a name="Mt24_38"></a><B><a href="/matthew/24-38.html">24:38</a></B> For as in the days that were before the flood they were <SUP><span>u</span></SUP> eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>u</span>) The word which the evangelist uses expresses the matter more fully then ours does: for it is a word which is used of brute beasts: and his meaning is that in those days men will pay attention to their appetites just like brute beasts: for otherwise there is nothing wrong with eating and drinking. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mt24_39"></a><a name="Mt24_40"></a><B><a href="/matthew/24-40.html">24:40</a></B> <SUP><span>10</span></SUP> Then shall two be in the field;
