<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) The infidels confessed that God would not punish but for just occasion: therefore, when he punishes, the occasion is just. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge20_5"></a><B><a href="/genesis/20-5.html">20:5</a></B> Said he not unto me, She [is] my sister? and she, even she herself said, He [is] my brother: in the integrity of my <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> heart and <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> innocency of my hands have I done this. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) As one falling by ignorance, and not doing evil on purpose. <BR>(<span>f</span>) Not thinking to do any man harm. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge20_6"></a><B><a href="/genesis/20-6.html">20:6</a></B> And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) God by his holy Spirit restrains those who offend in ignorance, that they not fall into greater offence.. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge20_7"></a><B><a href="/genesis/20-7.html">20:7</a></B> Now therefore restore the man [his] wife; for he [is] a <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> prophet, and he <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore [her] not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that [are] thine. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) That is, one to whom God reveals himself familiarly. <BR>(<span>i</span>) For the prayer of the godly is of force towards God. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge20_8"></a><a name="Ge20_9"></a><B><a href="/genesis/20-9.html">20:9</a></B> Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) The wickedness of the king brings Gods wrath on the whole realm. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge20_10"></a><a name="Ge20_11"></a><B><a href="/genesis/20-11.html">20:11</a></B> And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> fear of God [is] not in this place; and they will slay me for my wifes sake. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>l</span>) He shows that no honesty can be hoped for, where there is no fear of God. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge20_12"></a><B><a href="/genesis/20-12.html">20:12</a></B> And yet indeed [she is] my <SUP><span>m</span></SUP> sister; she [is] the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>m</span>) By sister, he means his full cousin, and by daughter Abrahams niece, ( <a href="/genesis/11-29.html">Genesis 11:29</a> ) for so the Hebrews use these words. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge20_13"></a><a name="Ge20_14"></a><a name="Ge20_15"></a><a name="Ge20_16"></a><B><a href="/genesis/20-16.html">20:16</a></B> And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand [pieces] of silver: behold, he [is] to thee a <SUP><span>n</span></SUP> covering of the eyes, unto all that [are] with thee, and with all [other]: <SUP><span>o</span></SUP> thus she was reproved. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>n</span>) Such a head as with whom you may be preserved from all dangers. <BR>(<span>o</span>) God caused this heathen king to reprove her because she concealed her identity, seeing that God had given her a husband as her veil and defence. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge20_17"></a><a name="Ge20_18"></a><B><a href="/genesis/20-18.html">20:18</a></B> For the LORD <SUP><span>p</span></SUP> had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abrahams wife. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>p</span>) Had taken away from them the gift of conceiving. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
