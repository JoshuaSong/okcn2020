But Judas takes an occasion here to accomplish his wicked purpose and plan. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mt26_7"></a><B><a href="/matthew/26-7.html">26:7</a></B> <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> There came unto him a woman having an alabaster <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat [at meat]. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>b</span>) For these things were done before Christ came to Jerusalem: and yet some think that the evangelists have two differing accounts. <BR>(<span>c</span>) These boxes were of alabaster, which in ancient times men made hollow to put in ointments: for some write that alabaster keeps ointment without changing it in any way; Pliny, book 13, chap. 1. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mt26_8"></a><B><a href="/matthew/26-8.html">26:8</a></B> But when his <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> disciples saw [it], they had indignation, saying, To what purpose [is] this <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> waste? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>d</span>) This is a figure of speech called synecdoche: for it is said that only Judas was moved at this; ( <a href="/john/12-4.html">John 12:4</a> ). <BR>(<span>e</span>) Unprofitable spending. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mt26_9"></a><a name="Mt26_10"></a><B><a href="/matthew/26-10.html">26:10</a></B> <SUP><span>4</span></SUP> When Jesus understood [it], he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>4</span>) We ought not to rashly condemn that which is not orderly done. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mt26_11"></a><B><a href="/matthew/26-11.html">26:11</a></B> <SUP><span>5</span></SUP> For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>5</span>) Christ, who was once anointed in his own person, must always be anointed in the poor. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mt26_12"></a><B><a href="/matthew/26-12.html">26:12</a></B> For <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did [it] for my burial. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) In that she poured this ointment upon my body, she did it to bury me. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mt26_13"></a><a name="Mt26_14"></a><a name="Mt26_15"></a><a name="Mt26_16"></a><a name="Mt26_17"></a><B><a href="/matthew/26-17.html">26:17</a></B> <SUP><span>6</span></SUP> Now <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> the first [day] of the [feast of] unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>6</span>) Christ purposing to bring us into our country without delay and so, to pay the penalty of the law, truly fulfils the law, omitting the contrary tradition and custom of the Jews: and thus shows that all things will so come to pass by the ministry of men as governed by the secret plan of God. <BR>(<span>g</span>) This was the fourteenth day of the first month: now the first day of unleavened bread should have been the fifteenth, but because the evening of this day (which after the manner of the Romans was referred to the day before) belonged by the Jews manner to the day following, therefore it is called the first day of unleavened bread. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mt26_18"></a><a name="Mt26_19"></a><a name="Mt26_20"></a><B><a href="/matthew/26-20.html">26:20</a></B> Now when the even was come, he <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> sat down with the twelve. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) Because the Law appointed them to be wearing footwear, and to have their staffs in their hands, as though they were is haste, therefore it is to be gathered that they did not sit down when they ate the Passover, but stood, for normally when they went to eat they took off their shoes: therefore he speaks here in this place, not of the Passover, but of the supper which was celebrated after the Passover was solemnly done. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mt26_21"></a><a name="Mt26_22"></a><a name="Mt26_23"></a><B><a href="/matthew/26-23.html">26:23</a></B> And he answered and said, He that <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> dippeth [his] hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>i</span>) That is to say, he whom I invited to come to my table, alluding in this to ( <a href="/psalms/41-9.html">Psalms 41:9</a> ), which is not to be understood as though just as the Lord spoke these words Judas had his hand in the dish (for that would have been an undoubted sign) but it refers to his tabling and eating with him. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mt26_24"></a><a name="Mt26_25"></a><B><a href="/matthew/26-25.html">26:25</a></B> Then Judas, <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I?

<SUP><span>m</span></SUP> this is my body. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>7</span>) Christ who will without delay fulfil the promises of the old covenant, institutes a new covenant with new signs. <BR>(<span>l</span>) Mark says, "Had given thanks": and therefore blessing is not a consecrating with a conjuring type of murmuring and power of words: and yet the bread and the wine are changed, not in nature but in quality, for without doubt they become tokens of the body and blood of Christ, not of their own nature or force of words, but by Christ his institution, which must be recited and laid forth, that faith may find what to lay hold on, both in the word and in the elements. <BR>(<span>m</span>) This is a figure of speech which is called metonymy: that is to say, the giving of one name for another: so he calls the bread his body, which is the sign and sacrament of his body: and yet nonetheless, it is a figurative and changed kind of speech meaning that the faithful do indeed receive Christ with all his gifts (though by a spiritual means) and become one with him. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mt26_27"></a><B><a href="/matthew/26-27.html">26:27</a></B> And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave [it] to them, saying, Drink ye <SUP><span>n</span></SUP> all of it; <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>n</span>) Therefore they who took away the cup from the people, disobeyed the instruction of Christ. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mt26_28"></a><B><a href="/matthew/26-28.html">26:28</a></B> <SUP><span>o</span></SUP> For this is my blood of the <SUP><span>p</span></SUP> new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>o</span>) That is, this cup or wine is my blood sacramentally, as in <I>See <a href="/commentaries/geneva-study-bible/luke/luke-1.html"> "Lu</a></I>. <BR>(<span>p</span>) Or covenant, that is to say, by which the new league and covenant is made, for in the making of leagues they used the pouring of wine and shedding of blood. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mt26_29"></a><a name="Mt26_30"></a><B><a href="/matthew/26-30.html">26:30</a></B> And when they had sung <SUP><span>q</span></SUP> an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>q</span>) When they had made an end of their solemn singing, which some think was six Psalms, ( <a href="/psalms/112-1.html">Psalms 112:1</a> ;
