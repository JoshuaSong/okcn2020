( <a href="/isaiah/7-13.html">Isaiah 7:13</a> ) ( <a href="/zechariah/12-10.html">Zechariah 12:10</a> ;  <a href="/micah/6-1.html">Micah 6:1</a>  <a href="/micah/6-2.html">Micah 6:2</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ho4_2"></a><B><a href="/hosea/4-2.html">4:2</a></B> By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> blood toucheth blood. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>b</span>) In every place appears a liberality to most wicked vices, so that one follows right after another. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ho4_3"></a><a name="Ho4_4"></a><B><a href="/hosea/4-4.html">4:4</a></B> Yet <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> let no man strive, nor reprove another: for thy people [are] as they that strive with the priest. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) As though he would say that it was in vain to rebuke them, for no man can endure it: indeed, they will speak against the prophets and priests whose office it is chiefly to rebuke them. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ho4_5"></a><B><a href="/hosea/4-5.html">4:5</a></B> Therefore shalt thou fall in the <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> day, and the prophet also shall fall with thee in the night, and I will destroy thy <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> mother. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) You will both perish together as one, because the former would not obey, and the other, because he would not admonish. <BR>(<span>e</span>) That is, the synagogue in which you boast. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ho4_6"></a><B><a href="/hosea/4-6.html">4:6</a></B> My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>f</span>) That is, the priests will be cast off, because for lack of knowledge they are not able to execute their charge, and instruct others; ( <a href="/deuteronomy/33-3.html">Deuteronomy 33:3</a> ;  <a href="/malachi/2-7.html">Malachi 2:7</a> ). <BR>(<span>g</span>) Meaning the whole body of the people, who were weary with hearing the word of God. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ho4_7"></a><B><a href="/hosea/4-7.html">4:7</a></B> As they were <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> increased, so they sinned against me: [therefore] will I change their glory into shame. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) The more I was beneficial to them. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ho4_8"></a><B><a href="/hosea/4-8.html">4:8</a></B> <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on their iniquity. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) That is, the priests seek to eat the peoples offerings, and flatter them in their sins. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ho4_9"></a><B><a href="/hosea/4-9.html">4:9</a></B> And there shall be, like people, like <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> priest: and I will punish them for their ways, and reward them their doings. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) Signifying that as they have sinned together, so will they be punished together. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ho4_10"></a><B><a href="/hosea/4-10.html">4:10</a></B> For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> commit whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left off to take heed to the LORD. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>l</span>) Showing that their wickedness will be punished in all ways: for even though they think by the multitude of wives to have many children, yet they will be deceived of their hope. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ho4_11"></a><B><a href="/hosea/4-11.html">4:11</a></B> <SUP><span>m</span></SUP> Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>m</span>) In giving themselves to pleasures, they become like brute beasts. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ho4_12"></a><B><a href="/hosea/4-12.html">4:12</a></B> My <SUP><span>n</span></SUP> people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth unto them: for the <SUP><span>o</span></SUP> spirit of whoredoms hath caused [them] to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their God. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>n</span>) Thus he speaks by derision in calling them his people, who now because of their sins they were not his people: for they sought help from stocks or wooden images and sticks or idols. <BR>(<span>o</span>) They are carried away with madness. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ho4_13"></a><B><a href="/hosea/4-13.html">4:13</a></B> They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof [is] good: therefore your daughters shall <SUP><span>p</span></SUP> commit whoredom, and your spouses shall commit adultery. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>p</span>) Because they take away Gods honour, and give it to idols: therefore he will give them up to their lusts, so that they will dishonour their own bodies;
