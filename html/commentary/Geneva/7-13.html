And he said, I [am]. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) He calls him man, because he so seemed, but he was Christ the eternal word, which at his appointed time became man. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jud13_12"></a><a name="Jud13_13"></a><a name="Jud13_14"></a><B><a href="/judges/13-14.html">13:14</a></B> She may not eat of any [thing] that cometh of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> unclean [thing]: all that I commanded her let her observe. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) Anything forbidden by the Law. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jud13_15"></a><a name="Jud13_16"></a><B><a href="/judges/13-16.html">13:16</a></B> And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering, thou must offer it unto the <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> LORD. For Manoah knew not that he [was] an angel of the LORD. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) Showing that he did not seek his own honour but Gods, whose messenger he was. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jud13_17"></a><a name="Jud13_18"></a><a name="Jud13_19"></a><B><a href="/judges/13-19.html">13:19</a></B> So Manoah took a kid with a meat offering, and offered [it] upon a rock unto the LORD: and [the angel] did <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> wondrously; and Manoah and his wife looked on. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) God sent fire from heaven to consume their sacrifice, to consume their faith in his promise. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jud13_20"></a><a name="Jud13_21"></a><a name="Jud13_22"></a><a name="Jud13_23"></a><B><a href="/judges/13-23.html">13:23</a></B> But his wife said unto him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands, neither would he have shewed us all these [things], nor would as at this time have told us [such things] as these. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) These graces that we have received from God, and his accepting of our obedience, are sure tokens of his love for us, so that nothing can hurt us. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
