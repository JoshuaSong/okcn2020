		<span><B><a href="/judges/15.html">Chapter 15</a></B></span><P><span><a name="Jud15_1"></a><B><a href="/judges/15-1.html">15:1</a></B> But it came to pass within a while after, in the time of wheat harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will <SUP><span>a</span></SUP> go in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would not suffer him to go in. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>a</span>) That is, I will use her as my wife. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jud15_2"></a><a name="Jud15_3"></a><B><a href="/judges/15-3.html">15:3</a></B> And Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> blameless than the Philistines, though I do them a displeasure. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>b</span>) For through his father-in-laws actions, he was moved again to take vengeance on the Philistines. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jud15_4"></a><a name="Jud15_5"></a><B><a href="/judges/15-5.html">15:5</a></B> And when he had set the brands on fire, he let [them] go into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> shocks, and also the standing corn, with the vineyards [and] olives. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) Or, that which was reaped and gathered. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jud15_6"></a><B><a href="/judges/15-6.html">15:6</a></B> Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they answered, Samson, the son in law of the <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> Timnite, because he had taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> burnt her and her father with fire. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) Or, the citizen of Timnath. <BR>(<span>e</span>) So the wicked do not punish vice for love of justice, but for fear of danger, which also might come to them. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jud15_7"></a><a name="Jud15_8"></a><a name="Jud15_9"></a><a name="Jud15_10"></a><B><a href="/judges/15-10.html">15:10</a></B> And the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up against us? And they answered, To <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as he hath done to us. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) And so being our prisoner to punish him. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jud15_11"></a><B><a href="/judges/15-11.html">15:11</a></B> Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines [are] rulers over us? <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> what [is] this [that] thou hast done unto us? And he said unto them, As they did unto me, so have I done unto them. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) Such was their gross ignorance, that they judged Gods great benefits to be a plague to them. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jud15_12"></a><a name="Jud15_13"></a><B><a href="/judges/15-13.html">15:13</a></B> And they spake unto him, saying, No; but we will bind thee fast, and <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> deliver thee into their hand: but surely we will not kill thee. And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him up from the rock. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) Thus they would rather betray their brother than use the means that God had given for their deliverance. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jud15_14"></a><a name="Jud15_15"></a><B><a href="/judges/15-15.html">15:15</a></B> And he found a <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and took it, and slew a thousand men therewith. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) That is, of an ass recently slain. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jud15_16"></a><a name="Jud15_17"></a><a name="Jud15_18"></a><B><a href="/judges/15-18.html">15:18</a></B> And he was sore athirst, and <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> called on the LORD, and said, Thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant: and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) By which it appears that he did these things in faith, and so with a true zeal to glorify God, and deliver his country. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
