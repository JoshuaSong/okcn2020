So that he desires to see the Thessalonians, that he may thoroughly perfect their faith and religion, that was as yet imperfect. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Th3_10"</a><a name="1Th3_11"</a><B><a href="/1-thessalonians/3-12.html">3:12</a></B> <SUP><span>3</span></SUP> And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all [men], even as we [do] toward you: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>3</span>) Another part of the epistle, in which he speaks of the duties of a Christian life. And he shows that the perfection of a Christian life consists in two things, that is, in charity toward all men, and inward purity of the heart. And the accomplishment of these things is nonetheless deferred to the next coming of Christ, who will then perfect his work by the same grace with which he began it in us. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
