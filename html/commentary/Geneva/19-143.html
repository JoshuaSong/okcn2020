Hear my prayer, O LORD, give ear to my supplications: <SUP><span>a</span></SUP> in thy faithfulness answer me, [and] in thy <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> righteousness. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>a</span>) That is, as you have promised to be faithful in your promise to all who trust in you. <BR>(<span>b</span>) That is, according to your free goodness, by which you defend your own. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps143_2"></a><B><a href="/psalms/143-2.html">143:2</a></B> And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> sight shall no man living be justified. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) He know that his afflictions were Gods messengers to call him to repentance for his sins, though toward his enemies he was innocent, and in Gods sight all men are sinners. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps143_3"></a><B><a href="/psalms/143-3.html">143:3</a></B> For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life down to the ground; he hath made me to dwell in darkness, as those that have been <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> long dead. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) He acknowledges that God is the only and true physician and heal him: and that he is able to raise him to life, though he were dead long ago, and turned to ashes. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps143_4"></a><B><a href="/psalms/143-4.html">143:4</a></B> Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> heart within me is desolate. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) So that only by faith and by the grace of Gods Spirit was he upheld. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps143_5"></a><B><a href="/psalms/143-5.html">143:5</a></B> I remember the <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> days of old; I meditate on all thy works; I muse on the work of thy hands. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) That is, your great benefits of old, and the manifold examples of your favour towards your own. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps143_6"></a><a name="Ps143_7"></a><a name="Ps143_8"></a><B><a href="/psalms/143-8.html">143:8</a></B> Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> morning; for in thee do I trust: <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) That is, speedily and in due season. <BR>(<span>h</span>) Let your Holy Spirit counsel me how to come forth from these great cares and troubles. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps143_9"></a><B><a href="/psalms/143-9.html">143:9</a></B> Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies: <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> I flee unto thee to hide me. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) I hid myself under the shadow of your wings that I might be defended by your power. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps143_10"></a><B><a href="/psalms/143-10.html">143:10</a></B> <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> Teach me to <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> do thy will; for thou [art] my God: thy spirit [is] good; lead me into the land of uprightness. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) He confesses that both the knowledge and obedience of Gods will comes by the Spirit of God, who teaches us by his word, gives understanding by his Spirit, and frames our hearts by his grace to obey him. <BR>(<span>l</span>) That is, justly and aright, for as soon as we decline from Gods will, we fall into error. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps143_11"></a><a name="Ps143_12"></a><B><a href="/psalms/143-12.html">143:12</a></B> And of thy mercy <SUP><span>m</span></SUP> cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them that afflict my soul: for I [am] thy <SUP><span>n</span></SUP> servant. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>m</span>) Which will be a sign of your fatherly kindness toward me. <BR>(<span>n</span>) Resigning myself wholly to you, and trusting in your protection. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
