But they will never by brought to mortify their own affections, and to give themselves willingly to serve God as he commands. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mic6_8"></a><B><a href="/micah/6-8.html">6:8</a></B> He hath shewed thee, O man, what [is] good; and what doth the LORD require of thee, <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) The Prophet in few words calls them to the observation of the second table of the ten commandments, to know if they will obey God correctly or not, saying that God has commanded them to do this. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mic6_9"></a><B><a href="/micah/6-9.html">6:9</a></B> The LORDS voice crieth unto the <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> city, and [the man of] wisdom shall see thy name: hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) Meaning, that when God speaks to any city or nation, the godly will acknowledge his majesty and not consider the mortal man that brings the threatening, but God that sends it. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mic6_10"></a><a name="Mic6_11"></a><a name="Mic6_12"></a><B><a href="/micah/6-12.html">6:12</a></B> For the rich men thereof <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> are full of violence, and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue [is] deceitful in their mouth. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) That is, of Jerusalem. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mic6_13"></a><a name="Mic6_14"></a><B><a href="/micah/6-14.html">6:14</a></B> Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> thy casting down [shall be] in the midst of thee; and thou <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> shalt take hold, but shalt not deliver; and [that] which thou deliverest will I give up to the sword. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) You will be consumed with inward grief and evils. <BR>(<span>l</span>) Meaning that the city would go about to save her men, as they that lay hold of that which they would preserve. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mic6_15"></a><a name="Mic6_16"></a><B><a href="/micah/6-16.html">6:16</a></B> For the <SUP><span>m</span></SUP> statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that I should make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof an hissing: therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my people. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>m</span>) You have received all the corruption and idolatry with which the ten tribes were infected under Omri and Ahab his son: and to excuse your doings, you allege the Kings authority by his statutes, and also wisdom and policy in so doing, but you will not escape punishment. But as I have shown you great favour, and taken you for my people, so will your plagues be according as your sins; ( <a href="/luke/12-47.html">Luke 12:47</a> ). <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
