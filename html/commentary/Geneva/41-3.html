		<span><B><a href="/mark/3.html">Chapter 3</a></B></span><P><span><a name="Mr3_1"></a><B><a href="/mark/3-1.html">3:1</a></B> And <SUP><span>1</span></SUP> he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there which had a <SUP><span>a</span></SUP> withered hand. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>1</span>) Thirdly, because they preferred the ceremonial law (which was but an addition to the moral law) before the moral law, whereas in reality they should have learned from this the true use of the ceremonial law. <BR>(<span>a</span>) That is, unprofitable and dead. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mr3_2"></a><a name="Mr3_3"></a><a name="Mr3_4"></a><B><a href="/mark/3-4.html">3:4</a></B> And he saith unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil? to save <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> life, or to kill? But they held their peace. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>b</span>) He uses here the figure of speech called synecdoche, for this type of saying, "to save the life", is the same as saying "to save the man". <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mr3_5"></a><B><a href="/mark/3-5.html">3:5</a></B> And when he had looked round about on them <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> with anger, being grieved for the <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> hardness of their hearts, he saith unto the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched [it] out: and his hand was restored whole as the other. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) Men are angry when they have wrong done to them, but not without sin: but Christ is angry without sin, and he is not sorry for the injury that is done to him as much as he is for their wickedness; and therefore he had pity upon them, and because of that he is said to have been grieved. <BR>(<span>d</span>) As though their heart had been closed up and had grown together, so that wholesome doctrine had no effect upon them. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mr3_6"></a><B><a href="/mark/3-6.html">3:6</a></B> <SUP><span>2</span></SUP> And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> Herodians against him, how they might destroy him. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>2</span>) The more the truth is suppressed, the more it comes out. <BR>(<span>e</span>) See ( <a href="/matthew/22-16.html">Matthew 22:16</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mr3_7"></a><a name="Mr3_8"></a><B><a href="/mark/3-8.html">3:8</a></B> And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and [from] <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> beyond Jordan;
