It is an abbreviated kind of speech very common among the Hebrews; it is the same as when we say, "Let me be taken for a liar", or something similar. And when they speak out the whole, they say, "The Lord do such and such by me." <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mr8_13"></a><a name="Mr8_14"></a><a name="Mr8_15"></a><B><a href="/mark/8-15.html">8:15</a></B> <SUP><span>2</span></SUP> And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and [of] the leaven of Herod. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>2</span>) We must especially take heed of those who corrupt the word of God, no matter what their position is in the Church or in civil politics. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mr8_16"></a><B><a href="/mark/8-16.html">8:16</a></B> <SUP><span>3</span></SUP> And they reasoned among themselves, saying, [It is] because we have no bread. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>3</span>) They that have their minds fixed on earthly things are utterly blinded to heavenly things, even though they are plainly set before them. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mr8_17"></a><a name="Mr8_18"></a><a name="Mr8_19"></a><a name="Mr8_20"></a><a name="Mr8_21"></a><B><a href="/mark/8-21.html">8:21</a></B> And he said unto them, <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> How is it that ye do not understand? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) How does it come to pass that you do not understand these things which are so plain and evident. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mr8_22"></a><B><a href="/mark/8-22.html">8:22</a></B> <SUP><span>4</span></SUP> And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch him. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>4</span>) A true image of our regeneration, which Christ, separating us from the world, works and accomplishes in us gradually. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mr8_23"></a><a name="Mr8_24"></a><B><a href="/mark/8-24.html">8:24</a></B> And he looked up, and said, I <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> see men as trees, walking. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) He perceived men moving but at the same time could not discern their bodies. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mr8_25"></a><B><a href="/mark/8-25.html">8:25</a></B> After that he put [his] hands again upon his eyes, and made him <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) He commanded him to try again, to determine whether or not he could indeed see well. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mr8_26"></a><B><a href="/mark/8-26.html">8:26</a></B> <SUP><span>5</span></SUP> And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell [it] to any in the town. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>5</span>) Christ will not have his miracles to be separated from his doctrine. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mr8_27"></a><B><a href="/mark/8-27.html">8:27</a></B> <SUP><span>6</span></SUP> And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Whom do men say that I am? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>6</span>) Many praise Christ, who yet nonetheless rob him of his praise. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mr8_28"></a><a name="Mr8_29"></a><a name="Mr8_30"></a><B><a href="/mark/8-30.html">8:30</a></B> <SUP><span>7</span></SUP> And he charged them that they should tell no man of him. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>7</span>) Christ has appointed certain times for the preaching of the gospel, and therefore here defers it to a more appropriate time, lest sudden haste should rather hinder than further the mystery of his coming. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mr8_31"></a><B><a href="/mark/8-31.html">8:31</a></B> <SUP><span>8</span></SUP> And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and [of] the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>8</span>) All that Christ suffered for us he suffered not unwillingly, neither as being unaware, but foreknowing it and willingly. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mr8_32"></a><B><a href="/mark/8-32.html">8:32</a></B> <SUP><span>9</span></SUP> And he spake that saying openly.
