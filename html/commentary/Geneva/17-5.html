		<span><B><a href="/esther/5.html">Chapter 5</a></B></span><P><span><a name="Es5_1"></a><B><a href="/esther/5-1.html">5:1</a></B> Now it came to pass on the third <SUP><span>a</span></SUP> day, that Esther put on [her] royal [apparel], and stood in the inner court of the kings house, over against the kings house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over against the gate of the house. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>a</span>) That is, after the Jews had begun to fast. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Es5_2"></a><B><a href="/esther/5-2.html">5:2</a></B> And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, [that] she obtained favour in his sight: and the king <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> held out to Esther the golden sceptre that [was] in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>b</span>) Which was a sign that her coming was agreeable to him, ( <a href="/esther/4-11.html">Esther 4:11</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Es5_3"></a><B><a href="/esther/5-3.html">5:3</a></B> Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and what [is] thy request? it shall be even <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> given thee to the half of the kingdom. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>c</span>) Meaning by this that whatever she asked would be granted as in ( <a href="/mark/6-23.html">Mark 6:23</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Es5_4"></a><a name="Es5_5"></a><a name="Es5_6"></a><B><a href="/esther/5-6.html">5:6</a></B> And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> wine, What [is] thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what [is] thy request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) Because they used to drink excessively in their banquets they called the banquet by that which was most in use or esteemed. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Es5_7"></a><a name="Es5_8"></a><B><a href="/esther/5-8.html">5:8</a></B> If I have found favour in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do to morrow as the king hath <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> said. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) I will declare what I demand. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Es5_9"></a><a name="Es5_10"></a><a name="Es5_11"></a><B><a href="/esther/5-11.html">5:11</a></B> And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all [the things] wherein the king had <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) Thus the wicked when they are promoted instead of acknowledging their charge and humbling themselves, wax ambitious, disdainful and cruel. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Es5_12"></a><a name="Es5_13"></a><a name="Es5_14"></a><B><a href="/esther/5-14.html">5:14</a></B> Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a gallows be made of fifty <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> cubits high, and to morrow speak thou unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) Meaning, the highest that could be found. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
