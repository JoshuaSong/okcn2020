And the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) That is, the power of man. <BR>(<span>e</span>) This declares that Hezekiah always put his trust in God, and yet made himself strong and used lawful means, lest he should seem to tempt God. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ch32_8"</a><B><a href="/2-chronicles/32-9.html">32:9</a></B> After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem, (but he [himself laid siege] <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> against Lachish, and all his power with him,) unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto all Judah that [were] at Jerusalem, saying, <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) While he besieged Lachish. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ch32_9"</a><a name="2Ch32_10"</a><a name="2Ch32_11"</a><B><a href="/2-chronicles/32-12.html">32:12</a></B> Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall worship before one altar, and burn incense upon it? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) Thus the wicked put no difference between true religion and false, God and idols: for Hezekiah only destroyed idolatry and replaced it with true religion. Thus the papists slander the servants of God: for when they destroy idolatry, they say that they abolish religion. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ch32_12"</a><a name="2Ch32_13"</a><B><a href="/2-chronicles/32-14.html">32:14</a></B> Who [was there] among all the <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of mine hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of mine hand? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) This is his blasphemy that he will compare the living God to vile idols. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ch32_14"</a><B><a href="/2-chronicles/32-15.html">32:15</a></B> Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you on this manner, neither yet believe him: for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> mine hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of mine hand? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) When man has prosperity, he swells in pride, and thinks himself able to resist and overcome even God himself. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ch32_15"</a><B><a href="/2-chronicles/32-16.html">32:16</a></B> And his servants spake yet [more] against the LORD God, and against his <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> servant Hezekiah. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) In this we see that when the wicked speak evil of the servants of God, they care not to blaspheme God himself for if they feared God, they would love his servants. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ch32_16"</a><a name="2Ch32_17"</a><B><a href="/2-chronicles/32-18.html">32:18</a></B> Then they <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> cried with a loud voice in the Jews speech unto the people of Jerusalem that [were] on the wall, to affright them, and to trouble them; that they might take the city. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>l</span>) Their words are written, ( <a href="/2-kings/18-19.html">2&nbsp;Kings 18:19</a> ). </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ch32_18"</a><B><a href="/2-chronicles/32-19.html">32:19</a></B> And they spake against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods of the people of the earth, [which were] the <SUP><span>m</span></SUP> work of the hands of man. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>m</span>) Which were invented, made and authorized by man. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ch32_19"</a><B><a href="/2-chronicles/32-20.html">32:20</a></B> And for this [cause] Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz, <SUP><span>n</span></SUP> prayed and cried to heaven. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>n</span>) This shows what the best refuge in all troubles and dangers is. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ch32_20"</a><B><a href="/2-chronicles/32-21.html">32:21</a></B> And the LORD sent an angel, which cut off all the mighty men of valour, and the leaders and <SUP><span>o</span></SUP> captains in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he was come into the house of his god, they that came forth of his <SUP><span>p</span></SUP> own bowels slew him there with the sword. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>o</span>) To the number of 185,000 as in ( <a href="/2-kings/19-35.html">2 Kings 19:35</a>  <a href="/2-kings/19-36.html">2 Kings 19:36</a> ). <BR>(<span>p</span>) Meaning, Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ch32_21"</a><a name="2Ch32_22"</a><B><a href="/2-chronicles/32-23.html">32:23</a></B> And many brought gifts unto the LORD to Jerusalem, and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah: so that he was <SUP><span>q</span></SUP> magnified in the sight of all nations from thenceforth. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>q</span>) Thus after trouble God sends comfort to all them who patiently wait on him, and constantly put their trust in his mercies. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ch32_23"</a><B><a href="/2-chronicles/32-24.html">32:24</a></B> In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death, and prayed unto the LORD: and he spake unto him, and he gave him <SUP><span>r</span></SUP> a sign. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>r</span>) To confirm his faith in Gods promise, who declared to him by his prophet that his life would be prolonged fifteen years. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ch32_24"</a><B><a href="/2-chronicles/32-25.html">32:25</a></B> But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit [done] unto him; for his heart <SUP><span>s</span></SUP> was lifted up: therefore there was wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>s</span>) He was lifted up with the pride of his victory and treasures, and shows them for an ostentation to the ambassadors of Babylon. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ch32_25"</a><a name="2Ch32_26"</a><a name="2Ch32_27"</a><a name="2Ch32_28"</a><a name="2Ch32_29"</a><B><a href="/2-chronicles/32-30.html">32:30</a></B> This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of <SUP><span>t</span></SUP> Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>t</span>) Which also was called Shiloh, of which mention is made in ( <a href="/isaiah/8-6.html">Isaiah 8:6</a> ;  <a href="/john/9-7.html">John 9:7</a> ). </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ch32_30"</a><B><a href="/2-chronicles/32-31.html">32:31</a></B> Howbeit in [the business of] the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was [done] in the land, God left him, to <SUP><span>u</span></SUP> try him, that he might know all [that was] in his heart. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>u</span>) Here we see the reason why the faithful are tempted, which is to determine whether they have faith or not, and that they may feel the presence of God who does not allow them to be overcome by temptations, but in their weakness administers strength. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
