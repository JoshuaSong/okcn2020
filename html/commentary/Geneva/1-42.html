And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) This concealing is not to be followed, nor any actions of the fathers not approved by Gods word. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge42_8"></a><a name="Ge42_9"></a><a name="Ge42_10"></a><a name="Ge42_11"></a><a name="Ge42_12"></a><a name="Ge42_13"></a><a name="Ge42_14"></a><a name="Ge42_15"></a><B><a href="/genesis/42-15.html">42:15</a></B> Hereby ye shall be proved: <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) The Egyptians who were idolaters, used to swear by their kings life: but God forbids swearing by anyone but him: yet Joseph dwelling among the wicked was corrupted by them. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge42_16"></a><a name="Ge42_17"></a><a name="Ge42_18"></a><B><a href="/genesis/42-18.html">42:18</a></B> And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; [for] I <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> fear God: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) And therefore am true and just. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge42_19"></a><a name="Ge42_20"></a><a name="Ge42_21"></a><B><a href="/genesis/42-21.html">42:21</a></B> And they said one to another, <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> We [are] verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) Affliction makes men acknowledge their faults, which otherwise they would conceal. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge42_22"></a><B><a href="/genesis/42-22.html">42:22</a></B> And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> blood is required. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) God will take vengeance on us, and measure us with our own measure. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge42_23"></a><a name="Ge42_24"></a><B><a href="/genesis/42-24.html">42:24</a></B> And he turned himself about from them, and <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) Though he acts harshly, yet his brotherly affection remained. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge42_25"></a><a name="Ge42_26"></a><a name="Ge42_27"></a><a name="Ge42_28"></a><B><a href="/genesis/42-28.html">42:28</a></B> And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, [it is] even in my sack: and their heart failed [them], and they were <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> afraid, saying one to another, What [is] this [that] God hath done unto us? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) Because their conscience accused them of their sin, they thought God had brought them trouble through the money. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge42_29"></a><a name="Ge42_30"></a><a name="Ge42_31"></a><a name="Ge42_32"></a><a name="Ge42_33"></a><a name="Ge42_34"></a><a name="Ge42_35"></a><a name="Ge42_36"></a><B><a href="/genesis/42-36.html">42:36</a></B> And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved [of my children]: Joseph [is] not, and Simeon [is] not, and ye will take Benjamin [away]: all these things are against <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> me. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) For they did not seem to be concerned or have any love for their brother which increased his sorrow: and partly as it appears he suspected them for Joseph. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
