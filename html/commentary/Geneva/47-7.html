		<span><B><a href="/2-corinthians/7.html">Chapter 7</a></B></span><P><span> <B><a href="/2-corinthians/7-1.html">7:1</a></B> Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the <SUP><span>a</span></SUP> flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>a</span>) Both of body and soul, that by this means the sanctification may be perfect, consisting in both the parts of the flesh. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Co7_1"</a><B><a href="/2-corinthians/7-2.html">7:2</a></B> <SUP><span>1</span></SUP> <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>1</span>) He returns again from that admonition to his own person, contrasting with them the testimonies both of his faithfulness and also of his continual good will towards them. <BR>(<span>b</span>) Let me have some place among you, that I may teach you. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Co7_2"</a><B><a href="/2-corinthians/7-3.html">7:3</a></B> I speak not [this] to <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> condemn [you]: for I have said before, that ye are in our hearts to die and live with [you]. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) To condemn you of unkindness or treachery. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Co7_3"</a><a name="2Co7_4"</a><a name="2Co7_5"</a><B><a href="/2-corinthians/7-6.html">7:6</a></B> Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> cast down, comforted us by the <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> coming of Titus; <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) Whose hearts are cast down, and are very much worn out. <BR>(<span>e</span>) With those things which Titus told me of you at his coming, that is, how fruitfully you read over my letters. And moreover and besides that, I am exceedingly refreshed with his presence. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Co7_6"</a><a name="2Co7_7"</a><B><a href="/2-corinthians/7-8.html">7:8</a></B> <SUP><span>2</span></SUP> For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though [it were] but for a season. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>2</span>) An objection: but you have handled us roughly. The apostle answers that he did not use his roughness without grief. And he adds moreover, that he is also glad now that he drove them to that sorrow even though it was against his will, since it was so profitable to them. For there is a sorrow not only praiseworthy, but also necessary, that is, by which repentance grows by certain degrees: and for this repentance he praises them highly. And this is the fifth part of this epistle. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Co7_8"</a><B><a href="/2-corinthians/7-9.html">7:9</a></B> Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) In that this sorrow did you much good in leading you to amend your obscene behaviour and sins. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Co7_9"</a><B><a href="/2-corinthians/7-10.html">7:10</a></B> For <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) Gods sorrow occurs when we are not terrified with the fear of punishment, but because we feel we have offended God our most merciful Father. Contrary to this there is another sorrow, that only fears punishment, or when a man is vexed for the loss of some worldly goods. The fruit of the first is repentance, and the fruit of the second is desperation, unless the Lord quickly helps. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Co7_10"</a><a name="2Co7_11"</a><B><a href="/2-corinthians/7-12.html">7:12</a></B> Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, [I did it] not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> sight of God might appear unto you. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) It was neither fake nor counterfeit, but such as I dare give account of before God. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
