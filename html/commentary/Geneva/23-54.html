Her deliverance under Cyrus was as her childhood, and therefore this was accomplished when she came of age, which was under the gospel. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa54_2"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/54-2.html">54:2</a></B> <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them extend the curtains of thy habitations: spare not, lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes; <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) Signifying that for the great number of children that God would give her, she would seem to lack room to lodge them. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa54_3"></a><a name="Isa54_4"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/54-4.html">54:4</a></B> Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: neither be thou confounded; for thou shalt not be put to shame: for thou shalt forget the shame of thy <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> youth, and shalt not remember the reproach of thy <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> widowhood any more. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) The afflictions which you suffered at the beginning. <BR>(<span>e</span>) When you were refused for your sins, ( <a href="/isaiah/50-1.html">Isaiah 50:1</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa54_5"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/54-5.html">54:5</a></B> For thy <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> Maker [is] thy husband; the LORD of hosts [is] his name; and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel; The God of the whole <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> earth shall he be called. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) That regenerated you by his Holy Spirit. <BR>(<span>g</span>) His glory will shine through the whole world, which seemed before to be shut up in Judea. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa54_6"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/54-6.html">54:6</a></B> For the LORD hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit, and a <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> wife of youth, when thou wast refused, saith thy God. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) As a wife who was forsaken in your youth. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa54_7"></a><a name="Isa54_8"></a><a name="Isa54_9"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/54-9.html">54:9</a></B> For this [is as] the <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> waters of Noah to me: for [as] I have sworn that the waters of Noah shall no more overflow the earth; so have I sworn that I will not be angry with thee, nor rebuke thee. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) As sure as the promise that I made to Noah, that the waters would no longer overflow the earth. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa54_10"></a><a name="Isa54_11"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/54-11.html">54:11</a></B> O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, [and] not comforted, behold, I will lay thy stones with <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> fair colours, and lay thy foundations with sapphires. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) By this he declares the excellent estate of the Church under Christ. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa54_12"></a><a name="Isa54_13"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/54-13.html">54:13</a></B> And all thy children [shall be] <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> taught from the LORD; and great [shall be] the peace of thy children. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>l</span>) By the hearing of his word and inward moving of his spirit. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa54_14"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/54-14.html">54:14</a></B> In <SUP><span>m</span></SUP> righteousness shalt thou be established: thou shalt be far from oppression; for thou shalt not fear: and from terror; for it shall not come near thee. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>m</span>) In stability and sureness, so that it will stand forever. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa54_15"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/54-15.html">54:15</a></B> Behold, they shall surely assemble, [but] not by <SUP><span>n</span></SUP> me: whoever shall assemble <SUP><span>o</span></SUP> against thee shall fall for thy sake. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>n</span>) And therefore will not prevail. <BR>(<span>o</span>) Meaning, the domestic enemies of the Church, as are the hypocrites. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa54_16"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/54-16.html">54:16</a></B> Behold, I have created the <SUP><span>p</span></SUP> smith that bloweth the coals in the fire, and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>p</span>) Signifying by this that man can do nothing, but so far as God gives power: for seeing that all are his creatures, he must govern and guide them. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
