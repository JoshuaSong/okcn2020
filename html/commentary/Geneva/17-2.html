They had many houses appointed, one for the virgins, another for the concubines and another for the queen. <BR>(<span>d</span>) Read what this purification was in ( <a href="/esther/2-12.html">Esther 2:12</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Es2_4"></a><a name="Es2_5"></a><a name="Es2_6"></a><a name="Es2_7"></a><a name="Es2_8"></a><a name="Es2_9"></a><a name="Es2_10"></a><a name="Es2_11"></a><B><a href="/esther/2-11.html">2:11</a></B> And Mordecai walked <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> every day before the court of the womens house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) For though she was taken away by a cruel law, yet he did not cease to have a fatherly care for her, and therefore often sought to hear of her. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Es2_12"></a><a name="Es2_13"></a><B><a href="/esther/2-13.html">2:13</a></B> Then thus came [every] maiden unto the king; whatsoever she desired was <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the kings house. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) Whatever apparel she asked for, the eunuch was bound to give to her. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Es2_14"></a><a name="Es2_15"></a><B><a href="/esther/2-15.html">2:15</a></B> Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the kings chamberlain, the keeper of the women, <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> appointed.
