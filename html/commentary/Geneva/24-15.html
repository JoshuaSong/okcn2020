I have neither <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> lent on interest, nor have men lent to me on interest; [yet] every one of them doth curse me. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) By these are the prophets words, complaining of the obstinacy of the people and that he was reserved to so wicked a time: in which also he shows what is the condition of Gods ministers, that is, to have all the world against them, though they give no opportunity. <BR>(<span>l</span>) Which is an opportunity for contention and hatred. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jer15_11"></a><B><a href="/jeremiah/15-11.html">15:11</a></B> The LORD said, <SUP><span>m</span></SUP> Verily it shall be well with thy remnant; verily I will cause the enemy to entreat thee [well] in the time of evil and in the time of affliction. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>m</span>) In this perplexity the Lord comforted me, and said that my last days would be quiet: and by the enemy he means here Nebuzaradan the captain of Nebuchadnezzar, who gave Jeremiah the choice either to remain in his country or to go where he would; or by the enemy he means the Jews, who would later know Jeremiahs faithfulness, and therefore favour him. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jer15_12"></a><B><a href="/jeremiah/15-12.html">15:12</a></B> Shall <SUP><span>n</span></SUP> iron break the northern iron and the steel? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>n</span>) As for the people, though they seemed strong as iron, yet they would not be able to resist the hard iron of Babylon, but would be led captives. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jer15_13"></a><a name="Jer15_14"></a><a name="Jer15_15"></a><B><a href="/jeremiah/15-15.html">15:15</a></B> O LORD, thou knowest: remember me, and visit me, and avenge me of my <SUP><span>o</span></SUP> persecutors; take me not away in thy longsuffering: know that for thy sake I have suffered rebuke. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>o</span>) He does not speak this out of a desire for revenge, but wishing that God would deliver his Church from them who he knew to be hardened and incorrigible. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jer15_16"></a><B><a href="/jeremiah/15-16.html">15:16</a></B> Thy words were found, and I <SUP><span>p</span></SUP> ate them; and thy word was to me the joy and rejoicing of my heart: for I am called by thy name, O LORD God of hosts. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>p</span>) I received them with a great joy, as he that is famished eats meat. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jer15_17"></a><B><a href="/jeremiah/15-17.html">15:17</a></B> I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor rejoiced; I sat alone <SUP><span>q</span></SUP> because of thy hand: for thou hast filled me with indignation. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>q</span>) I had nothing to do with the wicked contemners of your word, but lamented bitterly for your plagues: showing what the faithful should do when they see tokens of Gods anger. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jer15_18"></a><B><a href="/jeremiah/15-18.html">15:18</a></B> Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, [which] refuseth to be healed? wilt thou be altogether to me <SUP><span>r</span></SUP> as a liar, [and as] waters [that] fail? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>r</span>) And have not assisted me according to the promise? In which it appears that in the saints of God is imperfection of faith, which through impatience is often assailed as in ( <a href="/jeremiah/20-7.html">Jeremiah 20:7</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jer15_19"></a><B><a href="/jeremiah/15-19.html">15:19</a></B> Therefore thus saith the LORD, If thou shalt <SUP><span>s</span></SUP> return, then will I bring thee again, [and] thou shalt stand before me: and if thou shalt separate the <SUP><span>t</span></SUP> precious from the vile, thou shalt be <SUP><span>u</span></SUP> as my mouth: let them return <SUP><span>x</span></SUP> to thee; but return not thou to them. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>s</span>) If you forget these carnal considerations and faithfully execute your charge. <BR>(<span>t</span>) That is, seek to win the good from the bad. <BR>(<span>u</span>) That is, as my mouth has pronounced, ( <a href="/jeremiah/1-18.html">Jeremiah 1:18</a> ) and as here follows in ( <a href="/jeremiah/15-20.html">Jeremiah 15:20</a> ). <BR>(<span>x</span>) Do not conform yourself to their wickedness, but let them follow your godly example. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jer15_20"></a><B><a href="/jeremiah/15-20.html">15:20</a></B> And I will make thee to this people a fortified brasen wall: and they shall fight against thee, but they shall not <SUP><span>y</span></SUP> prevail against thee: for I [am] with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, saith the LORD. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>y</span>) I will teach you with an invincible strength and constancy, so that all the powers of the world will not overcome you. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
