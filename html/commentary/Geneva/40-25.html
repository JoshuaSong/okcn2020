Usury or loaning money at interest is strictly forbidden by the Bible, ( <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Exodus+22:25-27">Exodus 22:25-27</a> ;  <a href="/deuteronomy/23-19.html">Deuteronomy 23:19</a>  <a href="/deuteronomy/23-20.html">Deuteronomy 23:20</a> ). Even a rate as low as one per cent interest was disallowed, ( <a href="/nehemiah/5-11.html">Nehemiah 5:11</a> ). This servant had already told two lies. First he said the master was an austere or harsh man. This is a lie for the Lord is merciful and gracious. Next he called his master a thief because he reaped where he did not sow. Finally the master said to him sarcastically why did you not add insult to injury and loan the money out at interest so you could call your master a "usurer" too! If the servant had done this, his master would have been responsible for his servants actions and guilty of usury. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mt25_28"></a><a name="Mt25_29"></a><a name="Mt25_30"></a><a name="Mt25_31"></a><B><a href="/matthew/25-31.html">25:31</a></B> <SUP><span>3</span></SUP> When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>3</span>) A graphic setting forth of the everlasting judgment which is to come. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mt25_32"></a><a name="Mt25_33"></a><a name="Mt25_34"></a><B><a href="/matthew/25-34.html">25:34</a></B> Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) Blessed and happy, upon whom my Father has most abundantly bestowed his benefits. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
