Though God in his eternal counsel appointed the death and damnation of the reprobate, yet the end of his counsel was not their death only, but chiefly his own glory. Also because he does not approve sin, therefore it is here said that he would have them turn away from it that they might live. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Eze18_24"></a><B><a href="/ezekiel/18-24.html">18:24</a></B> But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, [and] doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked [man] doeth, shall he live? All his <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned: in his trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) That is, the false opinion that the hypocrites have of their righteousness. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Eze18_25"></a><B><a href="/ezekiel/18-25.html">18:25</a></B> Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> equal. Hear now, O house of Israel; Is not my way equal? are not your ways unequal? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) In punishing the father with the children. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Eze18_26"></a><a name="Eze18_27"></a><a name="Eze18_28"></a><a name="Eze18_29"></a><a name="Eze18_30"></a><a name="Eze18_31"></a><B><a href="/ezekiel/18-31.html">18:31</a></B> Cast away from you all your transgressions, by which ye have transgressed; and make <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will ye die, O house of Israel? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) He shows that man cannot forsake his wickedness, till his heart is changed which is only the work of God. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
