And he laid him down <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>b</span>) Thus the wicked do not consider what is just and lawful, but fret inwardly when they cannot have their inordinate lusts satisfied. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki21_4"</a><a name="1Ki21_5"</a><a name="1Ki21_6"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/21-7.html">21:7</a></B> And Jezebel his wife said unto him, <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, [and] eat bread, and let thine heart be merry: I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) As though she said, "You do not know what it means to reign. Command and do not beg". </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki21_7"</a><a name="1Ki21_8"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/21-9.html">21:9</a></B> And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> fast, and set Naboth on high among the people: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) For then they used to enquire of mens faults: for no one could truly fast if he was a notorious sinner. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki21_9"</a><a name="1Ki21_10"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/21-11.html">21:11</a></B> And the <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> men of his city, [even] the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto them, [and] as it [was] written in the letters which she had sent unto them. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) Thus the worldlings contrary to Gods commandment, who does not consent to the shedding of innocent blood, would rather obey the wicked commandments of princes than the just laws. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki21_11"</a><a name="1Ki21_12"</a><a name="1Ki21_13"</a><a name="1Ki21_14"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/21-15.html">21:15</a></B> And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for money: for Naboth is not alive, but dead. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) This example of monstrous cruelty the Holy Spirit leaves to us, to the intent that we should abhor all tyranny, and especially in those whom nature and kind should move to be pitiful and inclined to mercy. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki21_15"</a><a name="1Ki21_16"</a><a name="1Ki21_17"</a><a name="1Ki21_18"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/21-19.html">21:19</a></B> And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> Hast thou killed, and also taken possession? And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) Do you think to have an advantage by murdering an innocent? <BR>(<span>h</span>) This was fulfilled in Joram his son ( <a href="/2-kings/9-25.html">2 Kings 9:25</a>  <a href="/2-kings/9-26.html">2 Kings 9:26</a> ). </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki21_19"</a><a name="1Ki21_20"</a><a name="1Ki21_21"</a><a name="1Ki21_22"</a><a name="1Ki21_23"</a><a name="1Ki21_24"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/21-25.html">21:25</a></B> But there was none like unto Ahab, which did <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the LORD, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) By the wicked counsel of his wife he became a vile idolater, and cruel murderer, as one that gave himself wholly to serve sin. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki21_25"</a><a name="1Ki21_26"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/21-27.html">21:27</a></B> And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> softly. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) In token of mourning, or as some read, barefooted. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki21_27"</a><a name="1Ki21_28"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/21-29.html">21:29</a></B> Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: [but] in his <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> sons days will I bring the evil upon his house. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>l</span>) Meaning, in Jorams time, ( <a href="/2-kings/9-26.html">2&nbsp;Kings 9:26</a> ). <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
