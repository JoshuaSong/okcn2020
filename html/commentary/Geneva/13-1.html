But these are not the books of Chronicles which are mentioned in the books of the kings of Judah and Israel, which set forth the story of both kingdoms, and later perished in the captivity, but an abridgement of the same, and were gathered by Ezra, as the Jews write after their return from Babylon. This first book contains a brief rehearsal of the children of Adam to Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and the twelve patriarchs, chiefly of Judah, and the reign of David, because Christ came from him according to the flesh. Therefore it sets forth more amply his acts both concerning civil government, and also the administration and care of things concerning religion, for the good success of which he rejoices and gives thanks to the Lord. <BR>(<span>a</span>) Meaning, that Seth was Adams son, and Enoch was Seths son. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ch1_1"</a><a name="1Ch1_2"</a><a name="1Ch1_3"</a><B><a href="/1-chronicles/1-4.html">1:4</a></B> Noah, <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> Shem, Ham, and Japheth. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>b</span>) It would have been sufficient to have named Shem of whom came Abraham and David, but because the world was restored by these three, mention is also made of Ham and Japheth. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ch1_4"</a><a name="1Ch1_5"</a><a name="1Ch1_6"</a><a name="1Ch1_7"</a><a name="1Ch1_8"</a><a name="1Ch1_9"</a><B><a href="/1-chronicles/1-10.html">1:10</a></B> And Cush begat <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> Nimrod: he began to be mighty upon the earth. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) Who first lifted himself above others. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ch1_10"</a><a name="1Ch1_11"</a><a name="1Ch1_12"</a><a name="1Ch1_13"</a><a name="1Ch1_14"</a><a name="1Ch1_15"</a><a name="1Ch1_16"</a><B><a href="/1-chronicles/1-17.html">1:17</a></B> The sons of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> Aram, and Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Meshech. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) Of whom came the Syrians, and therefore they are called Amramites throughout all scripture. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ch1_17"</a><B><a href="/1-chronicles/1-18.html">1:18</a></B> And Arphaxad begat Shelah, and Shelah begat <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> Eber. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) Of him came the Hebrews who were later called Israelites of Israel, who was Jacob and Jews of Judah because of the excellency of that tribe. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ch1_18"</a><a name="1Ch1_19"</a><a name="1Ch1_20"</a><a name="1Ch1_21"</a><a name="1Ch1_22"</a><a name="1Ch1_23"</a><B><a href="/1-chronicles/1-24.html">1:24</a></B> <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> Shem, <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> Arphaxad, Shelah, <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) He repeats Shem again because he would come to the stock of Abraham. <BR>(<span>g</span>) Who came from Shem, and of him Shelah. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ch1_24"</a><a name="1Ch1_25"</a><a name="1Ch1_26"</a><a name="1Ch1_27"</a><a name="1Ch1_28"</a><a name="1Ch1_29"</a><a name="1Ch1_30"</a><a name="1Ch1_31"</a><B><a href="/1-chronicles/1-32.html">1:32</a></B> Now the sons of Keturah, Abrahams <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> concubine: she bare Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.
