The church cannot err: we are the Church, and therefore whoever speaks against us, they ought to die, ( <a href="/1-kings/22-24.html">1&nbsp;Kings 22:24</a> ;  <a href="/jeremiah/7-4.html">Jeremiah 7:4</a>  <a href="/jeremiah/20-2.html">Jeremiah 20:2</a> ;  <a href="/malachi/2-4.html">Malachi 2:4</a> ) and thus the false Church persecutes the true Church, which stands not in outward pomp, and in multitude, but is known by the graces of the Holy Spirit. <BR>(<span>h</span>) Let us slander him and accuse him: for we will be believed. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jer18_19"></a><a name="Jer18_20"></a><a name="Jer18_21"></a><B><a href="/jeremiah/18-21.html">18:21</a></B> Therefore <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> deliver their children to the famine, and pour out their [blood] by the force of the sword; and let their wives be bereaved of their children, and [be] widows; and let their men be put to death; [let] their young men [be] slain by the sword in battle. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) Seeing the obstinate malice of the adversaries, who grew daily more and more, the prophet being moved with Gods Spirit, without any carnal affection prays for their destruction because he knew that it would be to Gods glory, and profit of his Church. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
