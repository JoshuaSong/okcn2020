Thy birth and thy nativity [is] of the land <SUP><span>a</span></SUP> of Canaan; thy father [was] an Amorite, and thy mother an Hittite. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>a</span>) You boast to be of the seed of Abraham, but you are degenerate and follow the abominations of the wicked Canaanites as children do the manners of their fathers, ( <a href="/isaiah/1-4.html">Isaiah 1:4</a>  <a href="/isaiah/57-3.html">Isaiah 57:3</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Eze16_4"></a><B><a href="/ezekiel/16-4.html">16:4</a></B> And [as for] thy nativity, in the day thou wast <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> born thy navel was not cut, neither wast thou washed in water to cleanse [thee]; thou wast not salted at all, nor swaddled at all. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>b</span>) When I first brought you out of Egypt and planted you in this land to be my Church. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Eze16_5"></a><a name="Eze16_6"></a><B><a href="/ezekiel/16-6.html">16:6</a></B> And when I passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thy <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> own blood, I said to thee [when thou wast] in thy blood, Live; yea, I said to thee [when thou wast] in thy blood, Live. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) Being thus in your filthiness and forsaken by all men, I took you and gave you life: by which is meant that before God wash his Church and give life, there is nothing but filthiness and death. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Eze16_7"></a><a name="Eze16_8"></a><B><a href="/ezekiel/16-8.html">16:8</a></B> Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time [was] the time of love; and I spread my skirt over thee, and covered <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> thy nakedness: yea, I swore to thee, and entered into a covenant with <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> thee, saith the Lord GOD, and thou becamest mine. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) These words as blood, pollution, nakedness and filthiness are often repeated to beat down their pride, and to cause them to consider what they were before God received them to mercy, favoured them and covered their shame. <BR>(<span>e</span>) That you should be a chaste wife to me, and that I should maintain you and endue you with all graces. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Eze16_9"></a><B><a href="/ezekiel/16-9.html">16:9</a></B> Then I washed thee with <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> water; yea, I thoroughly washed away thy blood from thee, and I <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> anointed thee with oil. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) I washed away your sins. <BR>(<span>g</span>) I sanctified you with my Holy Spirit. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Eze16_10"></a><a name="Eze16_11"></a><a name="Eze16_12"></a><B><a href="/ezekiel/16-12.html">16:12</a></B> And I put a jewel in thy nose, and earrings in thy ears, and a beautiful <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> crown upon thy head. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) By this he shows how he saved his Church, enriched it, and gave it power and dominion to reign. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Eze16_13"></a><a name="Eze16_14"></a><B><a href="/ezekiel/16-14.html">16:14</a></B> And thy renown went forth among the nations for thy beauty: for it [was] perfect through my <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> comeliness, which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord GOD. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) He declares where the dignity of Jerusalem stood: that is, in that the Lord gave them of his beauty and excellency. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Eze16_15"></a><B><a href="/ezekiel/16-15.html">16:15</a></B> But thou didst <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> trust in thy own beauty, and didst play the harlot because of thy renown, and didst pour out <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> thy harlotries on every one that passed by; his it was. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) In abusing my gifts and in putting your confidence in your own wisdom and dignity, which were the opportunities of your idolatry. <BR>(<span>l</span>) There was no idolatry with which you did not pollute yourself. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Eze16_16"></a><B><a href="/ezekiel/16-16.html">16:16</a></B> And of thy garments thou didst take, and didst deck thy high places with various colours, <SUP><span>m</span></SUP> and didst play the harlot upon them: [the like things] shall not come, neither shall it be [so]. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>m</span>) This declares how the idolaters put their chief delight in those things which please the eyes and outward senses. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Eze16_17"></a><B><a href="/ezekiel/16-17.html">16:17</a></B> Thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given thee, and hast <SUP><span>n</span></SUP> made to thyself images of men, and hast committed harlotry with them, <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>n</span>) You have converted my vessels and instruments which I gave you to serve me with to the use of your idols. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Eze16_18"></a><a name="Eze16_19"></a><a name="Eze16_20"></a><B><a href="/ezekiel/16-20.html">16:20</a></B> Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou hast borne to me, and these hast thou sacrificed to them to <SUP><span>o</span></SUP> be devoured.

and hast multiplied thy harlotry, to provoke me to anger. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>p</span>) He notes the great impiety of this people, who first falling from God to seek help at strange nations also at length embraced their idolatry thinking by it to make their amity more strong. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Eze16_27"></a><a name="Eze16_28"></a><a name="Eze16_29"></a><a name="Eze16_30"></a><a name="Eze16_31"></a><B><a href="/ezekiel/16-31.html">16:31</a></B> In that thou buildest thy eminent place in the head of every way, and makest thy high place in every street; and hast not been as an harlot, <SUP><span>q</span></SUP> in that thou scornest hire; <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>q</span>) Meaning that some harlots contemn small rewards but no lovers gave a reward to Israel, but they gave to all others signifying that the idolaters bestow all their substance which they receive from God for his glory to serve their vile abominations. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Eze16_32"></a><a name="Eze16_33"></a><a name="Eze16_34"></a><a name="Eze16_35"></a><a name="Eze16_36"></a><a name="Eze16_37"></a><B><a href="/ezekiel/16-37.html">16:37</a></B> Behold, therefore I will gather all <SUP><span>r</span></SUP> thy lovers, with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and all [them] that thou hast loved, with all [them] that thou hast hated;
