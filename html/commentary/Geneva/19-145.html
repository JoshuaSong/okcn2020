and I will bless thy name for ever and ever. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>a</span>) He shows which sacrifices are pleasant and acceptable to God, even praise and thanksgiving and seeing that God still continues his benefits toward us, we ought never to be weary in praising him for the same. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps145_2"></a><a name="Ps145_3"></a><B><a href="/psalms/145-3.html">145:3</a></B> <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> Great [is] the LORD, and greatly to be praised; and his greatness [is] unsearchable. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>b</span>) By this he declares that all power is subject to God, and that no worldly promotion should obscure Gods glory. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps145_4"></a><B><a href="/psalms/145-4.html">145:4</a></B> One generation shall praise thy works to <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> another, and shall declare thy mighty acts. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) Even as the reason for mans creation and his preservation in this life is to praise God, therefore he requires that not only we ourselves do this, but cause all others to do the same. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps145_5"></a><a name="Ps145_6"></a><B><a href="/psalms/145-6.html">145:6</a></B> And [men] shall speak of the might of thy <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> terrible acts: and I will declare thy greatness. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) Of your terrible judgments against the wicked. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps145_7"></a><a name="Ps145_8"></a><B><a href="/psalms/145-8.html">145:8</a></B> The LORD [is] gracious, and full of <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> compassion; slow to anger, and of great mercy. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) He describes after what sort God shows himself to all his creatures though our sins have provoked his vengeance against all: that is, merciful not only in pardoning the sins of his elect, but in doing good even to the reprobate, although they cannot feel the sweet comfort of the same. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps145_9"></a><a name="Ps145_10"></a><a name="Ps145_11"></a><B><a href="/psalms/145-11.html">145:11</a></B> <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power;
