[He shall come] as an eagle against the house of the LORD, because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my law. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>a</span>) God encourages the Prophet to signify the speedy coming of the enemy against Israel, which was once the people of God. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ho8_2"></a><B><a href="/hosea/8-2.html">8:2</a></B> Israel shall <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> cry unto me, My God, we know thee. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>b</span>) They will cry like hypocrites, but not from the heart, as their deeds declare. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ho8_3"></a><a name="Ho8_4"></a><B><a href="/hosea/8-4.html">8:4</a></B> They have set up <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and I knew [it] not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) That is, Jeroboam, by whom they sought their own liberty, and to obey my will. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ho8_5"></a><B><a href="/hosea/8-5.html">8:5</a></B> Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast [thee] off; mine anger is kindled against them: how long [will it be] ere they attain to <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> innocency? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) That is, upright judgment and a godly life. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ho8_6"></a><B><a href="/hosea/8-6.html">8:6</a></B> <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> For from Israel [was] it also: the workman made it; therefore it [is] not God: but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) Meaning the calf was invented by themselves, and by their fathers in the wilderness. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ho8_7"></a><B><a href="/hosea/8-7.html">8:7</a></B> For they have <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: it hath no stalk: the bud shall yield no meal: if so be it yield, the strangers shall swallow it up. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) Showing that their religion has but a show, and in itself is but vanity. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ho8_8"></a><a name="Ho8_9"></a><B><a href="/hosea/8-9.html">8:9</a></B> For they are gone up to Assyria, a <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath hired lovers. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) They never cease, but run to and fro to seek help. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ho8_10"></a><B><a href="/hosea/8-10.html">8:10</a></B> Yea, though they have hired among the nations, now will I gather them, and they shall sorrow a little for the <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> burden of the king of princes. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) That is, for the king and the princes will lay upon them: and by this means the Lord brings them to repentance. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ho8_11"></a><a name="Ho8_12"></a><B><a href="/hosea/8-12.html">8:12</a></B> I have written to him the great things of my law, [but] they were counted as a <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> strange thing. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) In this way the idolaters consider the word of God as strange with regard to their own invention. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ho8_13"></a><B><a href="/hosea/8-13.html">8:13</a></B> They sacrifice flesh [for] the sacrifices of mine offerings, and eat [it; but] the <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> LORD accepteth them not; now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins: they shall return to Egypt. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) Saying that they offer it to the Lord, but he accepts no service which he himself has not appointed. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
