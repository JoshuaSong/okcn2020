		<span><B><a href="/job/7.html">Chapter 7</a></B></span><P><span><a name="Job7_1"></a><B><a href="/job/7-1.html">7:1</a></B> [Is there] not an appointed time to man upon earth? [are not] his days also like the days of an <SUP><span>a</span></SUP> hireling? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>a</span>) Has not a hired servant some rest and ease? Then in this my continual torment I am worse than a hireling. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Job7_2"></a><a name="Job7_3"></a><B><a href="/job/7-3.html">7:3</a></B> So am I made to possess <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>b</span>) My sorrow has continued from month to month, and I have looked for hope in vain. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Job7_4"></a><a name="Job7_5"></a><B><a href="/job/7-5.html">7:5</a></B> My flesh is <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken, and become loathsome. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) This signifies that his disease was rare and most horrible. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Job7_6"></a><B><a href="/job/7-6.html">7:6</a></B> My days are swifter than <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> a weavers shuttle, and are spent without hope. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) Thus he speaks in respect for the brevity of mans life, which passes without hope of returning: in consideration of which he desires God to have compassion on him. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Job7_7"></a><a name="Job7_8"></a><a name="Job7_9"></a><B><a href="/job/7-9.html">7:9</a></B> <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> [As] the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the grave shall <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> come up no [more]. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) If you behold me in your anger I will not be able to stand in your presence. <BR>(<span>f</span>) Shall no more enjoy this mortal life. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Job7_10"></a><a name="Job7_11"></a><B><a href="/job/7-11.html">7:11</a></B> Therefore I will not <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) Seeing I can by no other means comfort myself I will declare my grief in words, and thus he speaks as one overcome with grief of mind. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Job7_12"></a><B><a href="/job/7-12.html">7:12</a></B> [Am] I a sea, <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) Am I not a poor wretch?

Job uses all kinds of persuasion with God, that he might stay his hand. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Job7_18"></a><a name="Job7_19"></a><a name="Job7_20"></a><B><a href="/job/7-20.html">7:20</a></B> I have <SUP><span>n</span></SUP> sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>n</span>) After all temptations faith steps forth and leads Job to repentance: yet it was not in such perfection that he could bridle himself from reasoning with God, because he still tried his faith. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Job7_21"></a><B><a href="/job/7-21.html">7:21</a></B> And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I [shall] <SUP><span>o</span></SUP> not [be]. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>o</span>) That is, I will be dead. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
