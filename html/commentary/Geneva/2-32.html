for [as for] this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him. <BR>(<span>a</span>) The root of Idolatry is when men think that God is not present, unless they see him physically. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ex32_2"></a><B><a href="/exodus/32-2.html">32:2</a></B> And Aaron said unto them, <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> Break off the golden earrings, which [are] in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring [them] unto me. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>b</span>) Thinking that they would rather abandon idolatry, than give up their most precious jewels. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ex32_3"></a><B><a href="/exodus/32-3.html">32:3</a></B> And all the people brake off the <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> golden earrings which [were] in their ears, and brought [them] unto Aaron. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) Such is the rage of idolaters, that they spare no cost to satisfy their wicked desires. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ex32_4"></a><B><a href="/exodus/32-4.html">32:4</a></B> And he received [them] at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, after he had made it a <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> molten calf: and they said, These [be] thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) They remembered the sins of Egypt, where they saw calves, oxen and serpents worshipped. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ex32_5"></a><a name="Ex32_6"></a><a name="Ex32_7"></a><a name="Ex32_8"></a><B><a href="/exodus/32-8.html">32:8</a></B> They <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These [be] thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) By which we see the need we have to pray earnestly to God, to keep us in his true obedience, and to send us good guides. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ex32_9"></a><a name="Ex32_10"></a><B><a href="/exodus/32-10.html">32:10</a></B> Now <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) God shows that the prayers of the godly hold back his punishment. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ex32_11"></a><a name="Ex32_12"></a><a name="Ex32_13"></a><B><a href="/exodus/32-13.html">32:13</a></B> Remember <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit [it] for ever. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) That is, your promise made to Abraham. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ex32_14"></a><a name="Ex32_15"></a><a name="Ex32_16"></a><B><a href="/exodus/32-16.html">32:16</a></B> And the tables [were] the work of God, and <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> the writing [was] the writing of God, graven upon the tables. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) All these repetitions show how excellent a thing they defrauded themselves of by their idolatry. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ex32_17"></a><a name="Ex32_18"></a><a name="Ex32_19"></a><a name="Ex32_20"></a><B><a href="/exodus/32-20.html">32:20</a></B> And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt [it] in the fire, and ground [it] to powder, and strawed [it] upon the water, and made the children of Israel <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> drink [of it]. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) Partly to despise them for their idolatry, and partly so they would have no opportunity to remember the calf later. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ex32_21"></a><a name="Ex32_22"></a><a name="Ex32_23"></a><a name="Ex32_24"></a><a name="Ex32_25"></a><B><a href="/exodus/32-25.html">32:25</a></B> And when Moses saw that the people [were] <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> naked; (for Aaron had made them naked unto [their] shame among their enemies:) <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) Both destitute of Gods favour, and an occasion for their enemies to speak evil of their God. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ex32_26"></a><a name="Ex32_27"></a><B><a href="/exodus/32-27.html">32:27</a></B> And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, [and] go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>l</span>) This fact did so please God, that he turned the curse of Jacob against Levi to a blessing, ( <a href="/deuteronomy/33-9.html">Deuteronomy 33:9</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ex32_28"></a><a name="Ex32_29"></a><B><a href="/exodus/32-29.html">32:29</a></B> For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves to day to the LORD, even every man upon his <SUP><span>m</span></SUP> son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>m</span>) In revenging Gods glory we must have no partiality to person, but lay aside all carnal affection. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ex32_30"></a><a name="Ex32_31"></a><a name="Ex32_32"></a><B><a href="/exodus/32-32.html">32:32</a></B> Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, <SUP><span>n</span></SUP> out of thy book which thou hast written. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>n</span>) He esteemed the glory of God so much, that he preferred it even to his own salvation. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ex32_33"></a><B><a href="/exodus/32-33.html">32:33</a></B> And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my <SUP><span>o</span></SUP> book. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>o</span>) I will make it known that he was never predestined in my eternal counsel to life everlasting. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ex32_34"></a><B><a href="/exodus/32-34.html">32:34</a></B> <SUP><span>p</span></SUP> Therefore now go, lead the people unto [the place] of which I have spoken unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before thee: nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>p</span>) This demonstrates how grievous a sin idolatry is, seeing that at Moses prayer God would not fully remit it. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
