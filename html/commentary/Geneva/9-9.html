And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> seek the asses. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) All these circumstances were means to serve Gods providence, by which Saul (though not approved by God) was made king. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Sa9_3"</a><a name="1Sa9_4"</a><B><a href="/1-samuel/9-5.html">9:5</a></B> [And] when they were come to the land of <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> Zuph, Saul said to his servant that [was] with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave [caring] for the asses, and take thought for us. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) Where was Ramath Zophim, the city of Samuel. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Sa9_5"</a><a name="1Sa9_6"</a><a name="1Sa9_7"</a><B><a href="/1-samuel/9-8.html">9:8</a></B> And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> shekel of silver: [that] will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) Which is about five pence, read ( <a href="/genesis/23-15.html">Genesis 23:15</a> ). </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Sa9_8"</a><B><a href="/1-samuel/9-9.html">9:9</a></B> (Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to enquire of God, thus he spake, Come, and let us go to the <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> seer: for [he that is] now [called] a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.) <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) So called because he foresaw things to come. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Sa9_9"</a><a name="1Sa9_10"</a><a name="1Sa9_11"</a><B><a href="/1-samuel/9-12.html">9:12</a></B> And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, [he is] before you: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for [there is] a <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> sacrifice of the people to day in the high place: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) That is, a feast after the offering, which would be kept in a high place of the city appointed for that use. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Sa9_12"</a><B><a href="/1-samuel/9-13.html">9:13</a></B> As soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> bless the sacrifice; [and] afterwards they eat that be bidden.
