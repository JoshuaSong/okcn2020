And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>2</span>) Christ himself appears after his resurrection, and sending the women to his disciples, shows that he has not forgotten them. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mt28_10"></a><a name="Mt28_11"></a><B><a href="/matthew/28-11.html">28:11</a></B> <SUP><span>3</span></SUP> Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>3</span>) The more that the sun shines, the more that the wicked are blinded. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mt28_12"></a><a name="Mt28_13"></a><a name="Mt28_14"></a><B><a href="/matthew/28-14.html">28:14</a></B> And if this <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> come to the governors ears, we will persuade him, and secure you. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) For it was to be feared that it would be brought to the governors ears. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mt28_15"></a><a name="Mt28_16"></a><B><a href="/matthew/28-16.html">28:16</a></B> <SUP><span>4</span></SUP> Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>4</span>) Christ appears also to his disciples, whom he makes apostles. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mt28_17"></a><a name="Mt28_18"></a><a name="Mt28_19"></a><B><a href="/matthew/28-19.html">28:19</a></B> <SUP><span>5</span></SUP> Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>5</span>) The sum of the apostleship is the proclaiming of the doctrine received from Christ throughout all the world, and the ministering of the sacraments: the efficacy of which things depends not on the minsters but on the Lord. <BR>(<span>f</span>) Calling upon the Name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mt28_20"></a><B><a href="/matthew/28-20.html">28:20</a></B> Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> alway, [even] unto the end of the world. Amen. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) Forever: and this refers to the manner of the presence of his Spirit, by means of which he makes us partakers both of himself and of all his benefits, even though he is absent from us in body. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
