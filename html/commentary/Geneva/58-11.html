and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>5</span>) Enoch. <BR>(<span>c</span>) That he should not die. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Heb11_6"></a><B><a href="/hebrews/11-6.html">11:6</a></B> But without faith [it is] impossible to please [him]: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and [that] he is a <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> rewarder of them that diligently seek him. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>d</span>) This reward is not referred to our merits, but to the free promise, as Paul teaches in Abraham the father of all the faithful, ( <a href="/romans/4-4.html">Romans 4:4</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Heb11_7"></a><B><a href="/hebrews/11-7.html">11:7</a></B> <SUP><span>6</span></SUP> By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>6</span>) Noah. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Heb11_8"></a><B><a href="/hebrews/11-8.html">11:8</a></B> <SUP><span>7</span></SUP> By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>7</span>) Abraham and Sarah. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Heb11_9"></a><a name="Heb11_10"></a><B><a href="/hebrews/11-10.html">11:10</a></B> For he looked for a city which hath <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> foundations, whose builder and maker [is] God. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) This foundation is contrasted with their tabernacle. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Heb11_11"></a><a name="Heb11_12"></a><B><a href="/hebrews/11-12.html">11:12</a></B> Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> dead, [so many] as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) As unlikely to bear children, as if he had been dead. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Heb11_13"></a><B><a href="/hebrews/11-13.html">11:13</a></B> These all died in <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> faith, not having received the <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of [them], and <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> embraced [them], and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) In faith, which they had while they lived, and followed, them even to their grave. <BR>(<span>h</span>) This is the figure metonymy, for the things promised. <BR>(<span>i</span>) For the patriarchs were given to profess their religion by building an altar and calling on the name of the Lord when they received the promises. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Heb11_14"></a><a name="Heb11_15"></a><a name="Heb11_16"></a><a name="Heb11_17"></a><B><a href="/hebrews/11-17.html">11:17</a></B> By faith Abraham, when he was <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> promises offered up his only begotten [son], <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) Tried by the Lord. <BR>(<span>l</span>) Although the promises of life were made in that only begotten son Isaac, yet he appointed him to die; and so against hope he believed in hope. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Heb11_18"></a><a name="Heb11_19"></a><B><a href="/hebrews/11-19.html">11:19</a></B> Accounting that God [was] able to raise [him] up, even from the dead; from <SUP><span>m</span></SUP> whence also he received him in <SUP><span>n</span></SUP> a figure. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>m</span>) From which death. <BR>(<span>n</span>) For there was not the true and very death of Isaac, but as it were the death, by means of which he seemed also to have risen again. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Heb11_20"></a><B><a href="/hebrews/11-20.html">11:20</a></B> <SUP><span>8</span></SUP> By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>8</span>) Isaac. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Heb11_21"></a><B><a href="/hebrews/11-21.html">11:21</a></B> <SUP><span>9</span></SUP> By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph;
