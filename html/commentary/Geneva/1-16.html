And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>b</span>) She fails by limiting Gods power to the common order of nature, as though God could not give her children in her old age. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge16_3"></a><a name="Ge16_4"></a><B><a href="/genesis/16-4.html">16:4</a></B> And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> despised in her eyes. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) This punishment declares what they gain if they attempt any thing against the word of God. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge16_5"></a><a name="Ge16_6"></a><a name="Ge16_7"></a><B><a href="/genesis/16-7.html">16:7</a></B> And the <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>d</span>) Which was Christ, as appears in ( <a href="/genesis/16-13.html">Genesis 16:13</a>  <a href="/genesis/18-17.html">Genesis 18:17</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge16_8"></a><a name="Ge16_9"></a><B><a href="/genesis/16-9.html">16:9</a></B> And the angel of the LORD said unto her, <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) God rejects no estate of people in their misery, but sends them comfort. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge16_10"></a><a name="Ge16_11"></a><a name="Ge16_12"></a><B><a href="/genesis/16-12.html">16:12</a></B> And he will be a wild man; his hand [will be] against every man, and every mans hand against him; and <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) That is, the Ishmaelites will be a separate people by themselves and not part of another people. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge16_13"></a><B><a href="/genesis/16-13.html">16:13</a></B> And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou God seest me: for she said, <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> Have I also here looked after him that seeth me? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) She rebukes her own dullness and acknowledges Gods graces, who was present with her everywhere. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
