My wellbeloved hath a <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> vineyard in a very fruitful hill: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>a</span>) The prophet by this song sets before the peoples eyes their ingratitude and Gods mercy. <BR>(<span>b</span>) That is, to God. <BR>(<span>c</span>) Meaning that he had planted his Church in a place most plentiful and abundant. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa5_2"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/5-2.html">5:2</a></B> And he dug it, and removed its stones, and planted it with the choicest vine, <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> and built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a winepress in it: and he expected that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> wild grapes. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) He spared no diligence or cost. <BR>(<span>e</span>) In ( <a href="/isaiah/5-7.html">Isaiah 5:7</a> ) he declares what they were. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa5_3"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/5-3.html">5:3</a></B> And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> between me and my vineyard. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) He makes them judges in their own cause, for as much as it was evident that they were the cause of their own ruin. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa5_4"></a><a name="Isa5_5"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/5-5.html">5:5</a></B> And now come; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> will take away its hedge, and it shall be eaten up; [and] break down the wall of it, and it shall be trodden down: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) I will take no more care for it: meaning, that he would take from them his word and ministers and all other comforts, and feed them contrary plagues. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa5_6"></a><a name="Isa5_7"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/5-7.html">5:7</a></B> For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts [is] the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> judgment, but behold oppression; for righteousness, but behold <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> a cry. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) Judgment and righteousness are true fruit of the fear of God and therefore in the cruel oppression there is no religion. <BR>(<span>i</span>) Of them who are oppressed. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa5_8"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/5-8.html">5:8</a></B> Woe to them that join house to house, [that] lay field to field, till [there is] no <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> place, that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth!
