This was so that we, being clothed with his righteousness and blessed with his curses and sanctified by his only sacrifice, may be taken up into heaven. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mr15_25"></a><a name="Mr15_26"></a><a name="Mr15_27"></a><a name="Mr15_28"></a><a name="Mr15_29"></a><a name="Mr15_30"></a><a name="Mr15_31"></a><a name="Mr15_32"></a><a name="Mr15_33"></a><B><a href="/mark/15-33.html">15:33</a></B> And when the sixth hour was come, there was <SUP><span>6</span></SUP> darkness over the <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> whole land until the ninth hour. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>6</span>) How angry God was against our sins, which he punished in his son who is our sure substitute, is made evident by this horrible darkness. <BR>(<span>c</span>) By this word "land" he means Palestine: so that the strangeness of the wonder is all the more set forth in that at the feast of the passover, and in the full moon, when the sun shone over all the rest of the world, and at midday, this corner of the world in which so wicked an act was committed was covered over with great darkness. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mr15_34"></a><B><a href="/mark/15-34.html">15:34</a></B> And at the <SUP><span>7</span></SUP> ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>7</span>) Christ striving mightily with Satan, sin and death, all three armed with the horrible curse of God, grievously tormented in body hanging upon the cross, and in soul plunged into the depth of hell, yet he clears himself, crying with a mighty voice: and notwithstanding the wound which he received from death, in that he died, yet by smiting both things above and things beneath, by the renting of the veil of the temple, and by the testimony wrung out of those who murdered him, he shows evidently unto the rest of his enemies who are as yet obstinate, and mock at him, that he will be known without delay to be conqueror and Lord of all. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mr15_35"></a><a name="Mr15_36"></a><a name="Mr15_37"></a><a name="Mr15_38"></a><a name="Mr15_39"></a><a name="Mr15_40"></a><B><a href="/mark/15-40.html">15:40</a></B> <SUP><span>8</span></SUP> There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome; <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>8</span>) Christ, to the great shame of the men who forsook the Lord, chose women for his witnesses, who beheld this entire event. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mr15_41"></a><a name="Mr15_42"></a><a name="Mr15_43"></a><B><a href="/mark/15-43.html">15:43</a></B> Joseph of Arimathaea, an <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) A man of great authority, of the council of the sanhedrin, or else a man who was taken by Pilate for his own council. <BR>(<span>e</span>) If we consider what danger Joseph put himself into we shall perceive how bold he was. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
