		<span><B><a href="/daniel/12.html">Chapter 12</a></B></span><P><span><a name="Da12_1"></a><B><a href="/daniel/12-1.html">12:1</a></B> And at that <SUP><span>a</span></SUP> time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation [even] to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>a</span>) The angel here notes two things: first that the Church will be in great affliction and trouble at Christs coming, and next that God will send his angel to deliver it, whom he here calls Michael, meaning Christ, who is proclaimed by the preaching of the Gospel. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Da12_2"></a><B><a href="/daniel/12-2.html">12:2</a></B> And many <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame [and] everlasting contempt. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>b</span>) Meaning all will rise at the general resurrection, which thing he here names because the faithful should always consider that: for in the earth there will be no sure comfort. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Da12_3"></a><B><a href="/daniel/12-3.html">12:3</a></B> And they that be <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) Who have kept the true fear of God and his religion. <BR>(<span>d</span>) He chiefly means the ministers of Gods word, and next all the faithful who instruct the ignorant, and bring them to the true knowledge of God. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Da12_4"></a><B><a href="/daniel/12-4.html">12:4</a></B> But thou, O Daniel, <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> shut up the words, and seal the book, <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> [even] to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) Even though the most part despise this prophecy, yet make sure you keep it and esteem it as a treasure. <BR>(<span>f</span>) Until the time that God has appointed for the full revelation of these things: and then many will run to and fro to search for the knowledge of these mysteries, which things they obtain now by the light of the Gospel. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Da12_5"></a><B><a href="/daniel/12-5.html">12:5</a></B> Then I Daniel looked, and, behold, there stood other two, the one on this side of the bank of the <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> river, and the other on that side of the bank of the river. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) Which was the Tigris. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Da12_6"></a><a name="Da12_7"></a><B><a href="/daniel/12-7.html">12:7</a></B> And I heard the man clothed in linen, which [was] upon the waters of the river, when he held up his <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> right hand and his left hand unto heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever that [it shall be] for a <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> time, times, and an half; and when he shall have accomplished <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> to scatter the power of the holy people, all these [things] shall be finished. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) Which was as it were a double oath, and did the more confirm the thing. <BR>(<span>i</span>) Meaning, a long time, a longer time, and at length a short time: signifying that their troubles would have an end. <BR>(<span>k</span>) When the Church will be scattered and diminished in such a way as it will seem to have no power. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Da12_8"></a><a name="Da12_9"></a><a name="Da12_10"></a><a name="Da12_11"></a><B><a href="/daniel/12-11.html">12:11</a></B> And from the time [that] the <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> daily [sacrifice] shall be taken away, and the abomination that maketh desolate set up, [there <SUP><span>m</span></SUP> shall be] a thousand two hundred and ninety days. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>l</span>) From the time that Christ by his sacrifice will take away the sacrifices and ceremonies of the Law. <BR>(<span>m</span>) Signifying that the time will be long until Christs second coming, and yet the children of God ought not to be discouraged, even though it is deferred. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Da12_12"></a><B><a href="/daniel/12-12.html">12:12</a></B> Blessed [is] he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and <SUP><span>n</span></SUP> five and thirty days. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>n</span>) In this number he adds a month and a half to the former number, signifying that it is not in man to appoint the time of Christs coming, but that they are blessed that patiently wait for his appearing. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Da12_13"></a><B><a href="/daniel/12-13.html">12:13</a></B> But go <SUP><span>o</span></SUP> thou thy way till the end [be]: for thou shalt rest, and stand in thy lot at the end of the days. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>o</span>) The angel warns the Prophet patiently to wait, until the time appointed comes, signifying that he should depart this life, and rise again with the elect, when God had sufficiently humbled and purged his Church. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
