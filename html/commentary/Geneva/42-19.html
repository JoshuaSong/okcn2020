		<span><B><a href="/luke/19.html">Chapter 19</a></B></span><P><span><a name="Lu19_1"></a><B><a href="/luke/19-1.html">19:1</a></B> And <SUP><span>1</span></SUP> [Jesus] entered and passed through Jericho. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>1</span>) Christ especially guides by his grace those who seem to be furthest from it. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu19_2"></a><B><a href="/luke/19-2.html">19:2</a></B> And, behold, [there was] a man named Zacchaeus, which was the <SUP><span>a</span></SUP> chief among the publicans, and he was rich. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>a</span>) The overseer and head of the publicans who were there together: for the publicans were divided into companies, as we may gather from many places in the orations of Cicero. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu19_3"></a><a name="Lu19_4"></a><a name="Lu19_5"></a><a name="Lu19_6"></a><a name="Lu19_7"></a><B><a href="/luke/19-7.html">19:7</a></B> <SUP><span>2</span></SUP> And when they saw [it], they all murmured, saying, That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>2</span>) The world forsakes the grace of God, and yet is unwilling that it should be bestowed upon others. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu19_8"></a><B><a href="/luke/19-8.html">19:8</a></B> <SUP><span>3</span></SUP> And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord; Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> false accusation, I restore [him] fourfold. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>3</span>) The example of true repentance is known by the effect. <BR>(<span>b</span>) By falsely accusing any man: and this agrees most fitly to the master of the tax gatherers: for commonly they have this practice among them when they rob and spoil the commonwealth, that they claim to be concerned for nothing else except the profit of the commonwealth, and under this pretence they are thieves, and to such an extent that if men reprove them and try to redress their robbery and thievery, they cry out that the commonwealth is hindered. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu19_9"></a><B><a href="/luke/19-9.html">19:9</a></B> And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this house, forsomuch as he also is a <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> son of Abraham. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) Beloved of God, one that walks in the steps of Abrahams faith: and we gather that salvation came to that house because they received the blessing as Abraham had. (Ed.) <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu19_10"></a><a name="Lu19_11"></a><B><a href="/luke/19-11.html">19:11</a></B> <SUP><span>4</span></SUP> And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>4</span>) We must patiently wait for the judgment of God which will be revealed in his time. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu19_12"></a><a name="Lu19_13"></a><B><a href="/luke/19-13.html">19:13</a></B> <SUP><span>5</span></SUP> And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and said unto them, Occupy till I come. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>5</span>) There are three sorts of men in the Church: the one sort fall from Christ whom they do not see; the other, according to their God given position, bestow the gifts which they have received from God to his glory, with great pains and diligence; the third live idly and do no good. As for the first, the Lord when he comes will justly punish them in his time; the second he will bless according to the pains which they have taken; and as for the slothful and idle persons, he will punish them like the first. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu19_14"></a><a name="Lu19_15"></a><a name="Lu19_16"></a><B><a href="/luke/19-16.html">19:16</a></B> Then came the first, saying, Lord, <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> thy pound hath gained ten pounds. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) This was a piece of money which the Greeks used, and was worth about one hundred pence, which is about ten crowns. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu19_17"></a><a name="Lu19_18"></a><a name="Lu19_19"></a><a name="Lu19_20"></a><B><a href="/luke/19-20.html">19:20</a></B> <SUP><span>6</span></SUP> And another came, saying, Lord, behold, [here is] thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>6</span>) Against those who idly spend their life in deliberating and in contemplation. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu19_21"></a><a name="Lu19_22"></a><a name="Lu19_23"></a><B><a href="/luke/19-23.html">19:23</a></B> Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> bank, that at my coming I might have required mine own with usury? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>e</span>) To the bankers and money changers. Usury or loaning money at interest is strictly forbidden by the Bible, ( <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Exodus+22:25-27">Exodus 22:25-27</a> ;  <a href="/deuteronomy/23-19.html">Deuteronomy 23:19</a>  <a href="/deuteronomy/23-20.html">Deuteronomy 23:20</a> ). Even a rate as low as one per cent interest was disallowed, ( <a href="/nehemiah/5-11.html">Nehemiah 5:11</a> ). This servant had already told two lies. First he said the master was an austere or harsh man. This is a lie for the Lord is merciful and gracious. Next he called his master a thief because he reaped where he did not sow. Finally the master said to him that why did you not add insult to injury and loan the money out at interest so you could call your master a "usurer" too! If the servant had done this, his master would have been responsible for his servants actions and guilty of usury.
