(Ed.) (<span>4</span>) To judge or think of Christ after the reason of the flesh is the cause of infinite corruptions. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu18_16"></a><B><a href="/luke/18-16.html">18:16</a></B> <SUP><span>5</span></SUP> But Jesus <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> called them [unto him], and said, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>5</span>) The elect children of the faithful are included in the free covenant of God. (Ed.) <BR>(<span>g</span>) Those that carried the children, whom the disciples drove away. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu18_17"></a><B><a href="/luke/18-17.html">18:17</a></B> <SUP><span>6</span></SUP> Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>6</span>) Childlike innocence is an ornament of Christians. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu18_18"></a><a name="Lu18_19"></a><a name="Lu18_20"></a><a name="Lu18_21"></a><B><a href="/luke/18-21.html">18:21</a></B> <SUP><span>7</span></SUP> And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>7</span>) The enticement of riches carries many away from the right way. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu18_22"></a><a name="Lu18_23"></a><a name="Lu18_24"></a><B><a href="/luke/18-24.html">18:24</a></B> <SUP><span>8</span></SUP> And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God! <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>8</span>) To be both rich and godly is a singular gift of God. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu18_25"></a><a name="Lu18_26"></a><a name="Lu18_27"></a><a name="Lu18_28"></a><a name="Lu18_29"></a><B><a href="/luke/18-29.html">18:29</a></B> <SUP><span>9</span></SUP> And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of Gods sake, <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>9</span>) They become the richest of all who do not refuse to be poor for Christs sake. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu18_30"></a><a name="Lu18_31"></a><B><a href="/luke/18-31.html">18:31</a></B> <SUP><span>10</span></SUP> Then he took [unto him] the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>10</span>) As sure and certain as persecution is, so sure is the glory which remains for the conquerors. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu18_32"></a><a name="Lu18_33"></a><a name="Lu18_34"></a><B><a href="/luke/18-34.html">18:34</a></B> And they understood <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) By this we see how ignorant the disciples were. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu18_35"></a><B><a href="/luke/18-35.html">18:35</a></B> <SUP><span>11</span></SUP> And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>11</span>) Christ shows by a visible miracle that he is the light of the world. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu18_36"></a><a name="Lu18_37"></a><a name="Lu18_38"></a><a name="Lu18_39"></a><B><a href="/luke/18-39.html">18:39</a></B> <SUP><span>12</span></SUP> And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, [Thou] Son of David, have mercy on me. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>12</span>) The more snares and hindrances that Satan lays in our way, even by those who profess Christs name, so much the more ought we to go forward. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
