And here the prophet shows that if the Jews will repent, and turn wholly to God, they will have no more occasion to fast, or to show signs of heaviness, for God will send them joy and gladness. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Zec8_20"></a><B><a href="/zechariah/8-20.html">8:20</a></B> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; [It shall] yet [come to pass], that there shall come <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> people, and the inhabitants of many cities: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>l</span>) He declares the great zeal that God would give the Gentiles to come to his Church, and to unite with the Jews in his true religion, which would be in the kingdom of Christ. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
