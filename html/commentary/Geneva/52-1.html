		<span><B><a href="/1-thessalonians/1.html">Chapter 1</a></B></span><P><span><a name="1Th1_1"</a> <B><a href="/1-thessalonians/1-2.html">1:2</a></B> <SUP><span>1</span></SUP> We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers; <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>1</span>) An example of proper Christian rejoicing, by which also we learn, that those who have great gifts in them, are in two ways governed: first, if they consider that they have received all from God, and second, that continuance must be desired at his hands. And to these things this whole epistle exhorts the Thessalonians. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Th1_2"</a><B><a href="/1-thessalonians/1-3.html">1:3</a></B> <SUP><span>2</span></SUP> Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father; <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>2</span>) He commends them for three special gifts: effectual faith, continual love, and patient hope. And he does this to the end that they might be ashamed, being endued with such excellent gifts, not to continue in Gods election. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Th1_3"</a><B><a href="/1-thessalonians/1-4.html">1:4</a></B> Knowing, brethren beloved, your <SUP><span>a</span></SUP> election of God. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>a</span>) Literally, "that your election is of God". </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Th1_4"</a><B><a href="/1-thessalonians/1-5.html">1:5</a></B> <SUP><span>3</span></SUP> For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>3</span>) Another reason why they ought in no way start back but continue to the end, because they cannot doubt this doctrine which has been so many ways confirmed to them, even from heaven, as they themselves well knew. <BR>(<span>b</span>) Paul shows by two things that there followed very great fruit from his preaching, that is, by these gifts of the Holy Spirit, and that certain assurance which was thoroughly settled in their minds, as appeared by their willingly bearing the cross. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Th1_5"</a><B><a href="/1-thessalonians/1-6.html">1:6</a></B> <SUP><span>4</span></SUP> And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> joy of the Holy Ghost: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>4</span>) Another reason, because even to that day they embraced the Gospel with great cheerfulness, insomuch that they were an example to all their neighbours: so that it would be more shameful for them to faint in the middle of the race. <BR>(<span>c</span>) With joy which comes from the Holy Spirit. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Th1_6"</a><a name="1Th1_7"</a><a name="1Th1_8"</a><B><a href="/1-thessalonians/1-9.html">1:9</a></B> For <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, <SUP><span>5</span></SUP> and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God; <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) All the believers. (<span>5</span>) It is no true conversion to forsake idols, unless a man in addition worships the true and living God in Christ the only Redeemer. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Th1_9"</a><B><a href="/1-thessalonians/1-10.html">1:10</a></B> And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, [even] Jesus, which delivered us from <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> the wrath to come. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) This word "the" is not put here without reason: and by "wrath" is meant that revenge and punishment with which the Lord will in time judge the world in his terrible wrath. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
