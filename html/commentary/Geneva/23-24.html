Some read, My secret, my secret: that is, it was revealed to the prophet, that the good would be preserved and the wicked destroyed. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa24_17"></a><a name="Isa24_18"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/24-18.html">24:18</a></B> And it shall come to pass, [that] he who fleeth from the noise of the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for the <SUP><span>m</span></SUP> windows from on high are open, and the foundations of the earth do shake. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>m</span>) Meaning that Gods wrath and vengeance would be over and under them, so that they would not escape no more than they did at Noahs flood. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa24_19"></a><a name="Isa24_20"></a><a name="Isa24_21"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/24-21.html">24:21</a></B> And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] the LORD shall <SUP><span>n</span></SUP> punish the host of the high ones [that are] on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>n</span>) There is no power so high or mighty, but God will visit him with his rods. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa24_22"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/24-22.html">24:22</a></B> And they shall be gathered together, [as] prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison, and after many days shall they be <SUP><span>o</span></SUP> visited. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>o</span>) Not with his rods as in ( <a href="/isaiah/24-21.html">Isaiah 24:21</a> ) but will be comforted. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa24_23"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/24-23.html">24:23</a></B> <SUP><span>p</span></SUP> Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when the LORD of hosts shall reign on mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and before his ancients gloriously. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>p</span>) When God restores his Church, the glory of it will so shine, and his ministers (who are called his ancient men) that the sun and the moon will be dark in comparison to it. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
