Here it is declared, that whoever condemns the sign, also despises the promise. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge17_15"></a><a name="Ge17_16"></a><a name="Ge17_17"></a><B><a href="/genesis/17-17.html">17:17</a></B> Then Abraham fell upon his face, and <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> laughed, and said in his heart, Shall [a child] be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) Which proceeded from a sudden joy, and not from lack of faith. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge17_18"></a><a name="Ge17_19"></a><B><a href="/genesis/17-19.html">17:19</a></B> And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> everlasting covenant, [and] with his seed after him. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) The everlasting covenant is made with the children of the Spirit. A temporary promise is made with the children of the flesh, as was promised to Ishmael. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge17_20"></a><a name="Ge17_21"></a><a name="Ge17_22"></a><a name="Ge17_23"></a><B><a href="/genesis/17-23.html">17:23</a></B> And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abrahams house; and <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) They were well taught if they obeyed and were circumcised without resistance. This teaches that masters in their houses ought to be as preachers to their families, that from the highest to the lowest they may obey the will of God. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
