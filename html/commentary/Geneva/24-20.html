		<span><B><a href="/jeremiah/20.html">Chapter 20</a></B></span><P><span><a name="Jer20_1"></a><a name="Jer20_2"></a><B><a href="/jeremiah/20-2.html">20:2</a></B> Then Pashur struck Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the <SUP><span>a</span></SUP> stocks that [were] in the high gate of Benjamin, which [was] by the house of the LORD. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>a</span>) Thus we see that the thing which neither the king nor the princes nor the people dared to undertake against the prophet of God, this priest as a chief instrument of Satan first attempted, read ( <a href="/jeremiah/18-18.html">Jeremiah 18:18</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jer20_3"></a><a name="Jer20_4"></a><a name="Jer20_5"></a><a name="Jer20_6"></a><B><a href="/jeremiah/20-6.html">20:6</a></B> And thou, Pashur, and all that dwell in thy house shall go into captivity: and thou shalt come to Babylon, and there thou shalt die, and shalt be buried there, thou, and all thy <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> friends, to whom thou hast prophesied lies. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>b</span>) Who have allowed themselves to be abused by your false prophecies. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jer20_7"></a><B><a href="/jeremiah/20-7.html">20:7</a></B> O LORD, thou hast deceived me, and I was <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> deceived: thou art stronger than I, and hast <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> prevailed: I am in derision daily, every one mocketh me. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) In this appears the impatiency which often overcomes the servants of God when they do not see their labours profit, and also feel their own weakness. <I>See <a href="/commentaries/geneva-study-bible/jeremiah/jeremiah-15.html">Jeremiah 15:18</a></I> <BR>(<span>d</span>) You thrust me forth to this work against my will. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jer20_8"></a><B><a href="/jeremiah/20-8.html">20:8</a></B> For since I spoke, I cried out, I cried violence and <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> spoil; because the word of the LORD was made a reproach to me, and a derision, daily. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) He shows that he did his office in that he reproved the people of their vices and threatened them with Gods judgments: but because he was derided and persecuted for this, he was discouraged, and would have stopped preaching, except that Gods spirit forced him to it. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jer20_9"></a><a name="Jer20_10"></a><B><a href="/jeremiah/20-10.html">20:10</a></B> For I heard the defaming of many, fear on every side. <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> Report, [say they], and we will report it. All my friends watched for my fall, [saying], Perhaps he will be enticed, and we shall prevail against him, and we shall take our revenge on him. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>f</span>) Thus the enemies conferred together to know what they had heard him say, that they might accuse him of it, read ( <a href="/isaiah/29-21.html">Isaiah 29:21</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jer20_11"></a><B><a href="/jeremiah/20-11.html">20:11</a></B> <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> But the LORD [is] with me as a mighty terrible one: therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail: they shall be greatly ashamed; for they shall not prosper: [their] everlasting confusion shall never be forgotten. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) Here he shows how his faith strove against temptation and sought the Lord for strength. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jer20_12"></a><a name="Jer20_13"></a><a name="Jer20_14"></a><B><a href="/jeremiah/20-14.html">20:14</a></B> <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> Cursed [be] the day in which I was born: let not the day in which my mother bore me be blessed. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>h</span>) How the children of God are overcome in this battle of the flesh and the Spirit, and into what inconveniences they fall till God raises them up again: read ( <a href="/job/3-1.html">Job 3:1</a> ;  <a href="/jeremiah/15-10.html">Jeremiah 15:10</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jer20_15"></a><a name="Jer20_16"></a><B><a href="/jeremiah/20-16.html">20:16</a></B> And let that man be as the <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> cities which the LORD overthrew, and repented not: and let him hear the cry in the morning, and the shouting at noon; <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>i</span>) Alluding to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, ( <a href="/genesis/19-25.html">Genesis 19:25</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jer20_17"></a><B><a href="/jeremiah/20-17.html">20:17</a></B> Because he slew me not at my birth; or that my mother might have been my grave, and she had not been <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> delivered. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) Meaning that the fruit of it might never come to profit. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
