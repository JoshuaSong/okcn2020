Because thy heart [is] lifted up, and thou hast said, <SUP><span>a</span></SUP> I [am] a god, I sit [in] the seat of God, in the midst of the seas; yet thou [art] a man, and not God, though thou settest thy heart as the heart of God: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>a</span>) I am safe as God is safe in the heavens and no one can hurt me. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Eze28_3"></a><B><a href="/ezekiel/28-3.html">28:3</a></B> Behold, thou [art] wiser than <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> Daniel; there is no secret that they can hide from thee: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>b</span>) Thus he speaks by derision: for Daniel had declared notable signs of his wisdom in Babylon, when Ezekiel wrote this. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Eze28_4"></a><a name="Eze28_5"></a><a name="Eze28_6"></a><a name="Eze28_7"></a><a name="Eze28_8"></a><a name="Eze28_9"></a><a name="Eze28_10"></a><B><a href="/ezekiel/28-10.html">28:10</a></B> Thou shalt die the deaths of the <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> uncircumcised by the hand of strangers: for I have spoken [it], saith the Lord GOD. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) Like the rest of the heathen and infidels who are Gods enemies. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Eze28_11"></a><a name="Eze28_12"></a><B><a href="/ezekiel/28-12.html">28:12</a></B> Son of man, take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyre, and say to him, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou sealest up the sum, full of <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> wisdom, and perfect in beauty. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) He derides the vain opinion and confidence that the Tyrians had in their riches, strength and pleasures. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Eze28_13"></a><a name="Eze28_14"></a><B><a href="/ezekiel/28-14.html">28:14</a></B> Thou [art] <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> [so]: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> stones of fire. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) He means the royal state of Tyre, which for the excellency and glory of it he compares to the cherubim which covered the Ark, and by "anointed" he signifies the same. <BR>(<span>f</span>) I did you this honour to make you one of the builders of my temple, which was when Hiram sent to Solomon things necessary for the work. <BR>(<span>g</span>) That is, among my people Israel, which shined as precious stones. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Eze28_15"></a><B><a href="/ezekiel/28-15.html">28:15</a></B> Thou [wast] perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> created, till iniquity was found in thee. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) Which was when I first called you to this dignity. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Eze28_16"></a><B><a href="/ezekiel/28-16.html">28:16</a></B> By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> mountain of God: and I will destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) You will have no part among my people. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Eze28_17"></a><a name="Eze28_18"></a><B><a href="/ezekiel/28-18.html">28:18</a></B> Thou hast defiled thy <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> sanctuaries by the multitude of thy iniquities, by the iniquity of thy merchandise; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) That is, the honour to which I called them. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Eze28_19"></a><a name="Eze28_20"></a><a name="Eze28_21"></a><a name="Eze28_22"></a><B><a href="/ezekiel/28-22.html">28:22</a></B> And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I [am] against thee, O Zidon; and I will be <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> glorified in the midst of thee: and they shall know that I [am] the LORD, when I shall have executed judgments in her, and shall be sanctified in her. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>l</span>) By executing my judgments against your wickedness. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Eze28_23"></a><B><a href="/ezekiel/28-23.html">28:23</a></B> For I will send into her pestilence, and blood into her streets; and the wounded shall be judged in the midst of her <SUP><span>m</span></SUP> by the sword upon her on every side; and they shall know that I [am] the LORD. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>m</span>) That is Nebuchadnezzar. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Eze28_24"></a><a name="Eze28_25"></a><B><a href="/ezekiel/28-25.html">28:25</a></B> Thus saith the Lord GOD; When I shall have gathered the house of Israel from the people among whom they are scattered, and shall be <SUP><span>n</span></SUP> sanctified in them in the sight of the nations, then shall they dwell in their land that I have given to my servant Jacob. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>n</span>) He shows why God will assemble his Church and preserve it, though he destroy his enemies: that is, that they should praise him, and give thanks for his great mercies. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
