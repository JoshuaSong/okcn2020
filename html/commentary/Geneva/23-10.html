		<span><B><a href="/isaiah/10.html">Chapter 10</a></B></span><P><span><a name="Isa10_1"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/10-1.html">10:1</a></B> Woe to them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that <SUP><span>a</span></SUP> write grievousness [which] they have prescribed; <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>a</span>) Who write and pronounce a wicked sentence to oppress the people: meaning, that the wicked magistrate, who were the chief cause of mischief, would be first punished. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa10_2"></a><a name="Isa10_3"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/10-3.html">10:3</a></B> And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation [which] shall come from <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> far? to whom will ye flee for help? and where will ye leave your <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> glory? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>b</span>) That is, from Assyria. <BR>(<span>c</span>) Your riches and authority, that they may be safe and that you may receive them again. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa10_4"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/10-4.html">10:4</a></B> <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> Without me they shall bow down under the prisoners, and they shall fall under the slain. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand [is] stretched out still. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) Because they have forsaken me, some will go into captivity and the rest will be slain. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa10_5"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/10-5.html">10:5</a></B> O <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> Assyrian, the rod of my anger, and the staff in their hand is my indignation. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) God calls for the Assyrians to be the executioners of his vengeance. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa10_6"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/10-6.html">10:6</a></B> I will send <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> him against an hypocritical nation, and against the people of my wrath will I command him, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) That is, the Assyrians against the Jews who are hypocrites. In the sixth and seventh verse is declared the difference of the work of God and of the wicked in one very thing and act: for Gods intention is to chastise them for their amendment, and the Assyrians purpose is to destroy them to enrich themselves. Thus in respect to Gods justice, it is Gods work, but in respect to their own malice, it is the work of the devil. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa10_7"></a><a name="Isa10_8"></a><a name="Isa10_9"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/10-9.html">10:9</a></B> [Is] not Calno as <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> Carchemish?
