So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) Which were the posterity of Jethro, Moses father in law. <BR>(<span>d</span>) For Jethro came to visit them, and gave them good counsel, ( <a href="/exodus/18-19.html">Exodus 18:19</a> ). </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Sa15_6"</a><a name="1Sa15_7"</a><a name="1Sa15_8"</a><a name="1Sa15_9"</a><a name="1Sa15_10"</a><B><a href="/1-samuel/15-11.html">15:11</a></B> It <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> repenteth me that I have set up Saul [to be] king: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the LORD all night. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) God in his eternal counsel never changes or repents, as in ( <a href="/1-samuel/15-29.html">1&nbsp;Samuel 15:29</a> ), though he seems to us to repent when anything goes contrary to his temporal election. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Sa15_11"</a><a name="1Sa15_12"</a><B><a href="/1-samuel/15-13.html">15:13</a></B> And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed [be] thou of the LORD: I have performed the <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> commandment of the LORD. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) This is the nature of hypocrites to be impudent against the truth, to condemn others, and justify themselves. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Sa15_13"</a><a name="1Sa15_14"</a><a name="1Sa15_15"</a><a name="1Sa15_16"</a><B><a href="/1-samuel/15-17.html">15:17</a></B> And Samuel said, When thou [wast] <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> little in thine own sight, [wast] thou not [made] the head of the tribes of Israel, and the LORD anointed thee king over Israel? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) Meaning, of base condition as in ( <a href="/1-samuel/9-21.html">1&nbsp;Samuel 9:21</a> ). </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Sa15_17"</a><a name="1Sa15_18"</a><a name="1Sa15_19"</a><B><a href="/1-samuel/15-20.html">15:20</a></B> And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> I have obeyed the voice of the LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) He stands most impudently in his own defence both against God and his own conscience. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Sa15_20"</a><a name="1Sa15_21"</a><a name="1Sa15_22"</a><B><a href="/1-samuel/15-23.html">15:23</a></B> For <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> rebellion [is as] the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness [is as] iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, he hath also rejected thee from [being] king. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) God hates nothing more than the disobedience of his commandment, even though the intent seems good to man. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Sa15_23"</a><a name="1Sa15_24"</a><B><a href="/1-samuel/15-25.html">15:25</a></B> Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) This was not true repentance, but deceit out of fear for the loss of his kingdom. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Sa15_25"</a><a name="1Sa15_26"</a><a name="1Sa15_27"</a><B><a href="/1-samuel/15-28.html">15:28</a></B> And Samuel said unto him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> neighbour of thine, [that is] better than thou. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>l</span>) That is, to David. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Sa15_28"</a><B><a href="/1-samuel/15-29.html">15:29</a></B> And also the <SUP><span>m</span></SUP> Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he [is] not a man, that he should repent. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>m</span>) Meaning God, who maintains and prefers his own. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Sa15_29"</a><a name="1Sa15_30"</a><a name="1Sa15_31"</a><B><a href="/1-samuel/15-32.html">15:32</a></B> Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites.
