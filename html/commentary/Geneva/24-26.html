And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the LORD. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>f</span>) Because of Gods promises to the temple, ( <a href="/psalms/132-14.html">Psalms 132:14</a> ) that he would forever remain there, hypocrites thought this temple could never perish and therefore thought it blasphemy to speak against it, ( <a href="/matthew/26-61.html">Matthew 26:61</a> ;  <a href="/acts/6-13.html">Acts 6:13</a> ) not considering that this was meant of the Church where God will remain forever. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jer26_10"></a><B><a href="/jeremiah/26-10.html">26:10</a></B> When the princes of Judah heard these things, then they came up from the kings house to the house of the LORD, and sat down in the entrance of the <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> new gate of the LORDS [house]. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>g</span>) So called, because it was repaired by Jotham, ( <a href="/2-kings/15-35.html">2&nbsp;Kings 15:35</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jer26_11"></a><a name="Jer26_12"></a><B><a href="/jeremiah/26-12.html">26:12</a></B> Then Jeremiah spoke to all the princes and to all the people, saying, The LORD <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) He both shows the cause of his doings plainly and also threatens them that nothing would help, though they should put him to death, but heap greater vengeance on their heads. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jer26_13"></a><a name="Jer26_14"></a><a name="Jer26_15"></a><a name="Jer26_16"></a><a name="Jer26_17"></a><a name="Jer26_18"></a><B><a href="/jeremiah/26-18.html">26:18</a></B> Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Zion shall be plowed [like] a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> house as the high places of the forest. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) That is, of the House of the Lord, that is, Zion, and these examples the godly alleged to deliver Jeremiah out of the priests hands, whose rage else would not have been satisfied but by his death. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jer26_19"></a><B><a href="/jeremiah/26-19.html">26:19</a></B> Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him to death? did he not fear the LORD, and beseech the LORD, and the LORD repented of the <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> evil which he had pronounced against them?
