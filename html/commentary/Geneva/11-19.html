And, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the LORD; [but] the LORD [was] <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; [but] the LORD [was] not in the earthquake: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) For the nature of man is not able to come near God, if he appeared in his strength and full majesty, and therefore he mercifully submits himself to our limitations. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki19_11"</a><a name="1Ki19_12"</a><a name="1Ki19_13"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/19-14.html">19:14</a></B> And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> because the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, [even] I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) So should not depend on the multitude in maintaining Gods glory, but because our duty requires us to do it. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki19_14"</a><a name="1Ki19_15"</a><a name="1Ki19_16"</a><a name="1Ki19_17"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/19-18.html">19:18</a></B> Yet I have left [me] seven thousand in Israel, <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) He declares that wicked deceivers and idolaters are not his. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki19_18"</a><a name="1Ki19_19"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/19-20.html">19:20</a></B> And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and [then] I will follow thee.
