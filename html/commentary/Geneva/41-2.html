First, by not considering what every mans strength is able to bear, they rashly make all sorts of laws concerning such things, without any discretion. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mr2_19"></a><a name="Mr2_20"></a><a name="Mr2_21"></a><a name="Mr2_22"></a><a name="Mr2_23"></a><B><a href="/mark/2-23.html">2:23</a></B> <SUP><span>4</span></SUP> And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>4</span>) Secondly, because they do not distinguish between the laws which God made concerning things, and the laws that they made concerning the same things, which are not at all based on the law. <BR>(<span>h</span>) Literally, "on the Sabbaths", that is, on the holy days. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mr2_24"></a><a name="Mr2_25"></a><a name="Mr2_26"></a><B><a href="/mark/2-26.html">2:26</a></B> How he went into the house of God in the days of <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>i</span>) In ( <a href="/1-samuel/21-1.html">1&nbsp;Samuel 21:1</a> ) he is called Ahimelech and his son is called Abiathar, but by conferring other places it is plain that both of them had two names; see ( <a href="/1-chronicles/24-6.html">1&nbsp;Chronicles 24:6</a> ;  <a href="/2-samuel/8-17.html">2&nbsp;Samuel 8:17</a> ;  <a href="/2-samuel/15-29.html">2&nbsp;Samuel 15:29</a> ;  <a href="/1-kings/2-26.html">1&nbsp;Kings 2:26</a> ;  <a href="/2-kings/25-18.html">2&nbsp;Kings 25:18</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mr2_27"></a><a name="Mr2_28"></a><B><a href="/mark/2-28.html">2:28</a></B> Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> sabbath. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) Has the sabbath day in his power, and may rule it as he desires. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
