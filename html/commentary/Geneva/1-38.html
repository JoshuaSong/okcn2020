And Tamar went and dwelt in her fathers house. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) For she could not marry in any other family so long as Judah would retain her in his. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge38_12"></a><a name="Ge38_13"></a><a name="Ge38_14"></a><a name="Ge38_15"></a><a name="Ge38_16"></a><B><a href="/genesis/38-16.html">38:16</a></B> And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> knew not that she [was] his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) God miraculously blinded him so that he could not know her by her voice. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge38_17"></a><a name="Ge38_18"></a><a name="Ge38_19"></a><a name="Ge38_20"></a><B><a href="/genesis/38-20.html">38:20</a></B> And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> friend the Adullamite, to receive [his] pledge from the womans hand: but he found her not. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) That his wickedness might not be known to others. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge38_21"></a><a name="Ge38_22"></a><a name="Ge38_23"></a><B><a href="/genesis/38-23.html">38:23</a></B> And Judah said, Let her take [it] to her, lest we be <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) He fears man more than God. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge38_24"></a><B><a href="/genesis/38-24.html">38:24</a></B> And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she [is] with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> burnt. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) We see that the Law, which was written in mans heart, taught them that adultery should be punished with death, even though no law had been given yet. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge38_25"></a><a name="Ge38_26"></a><B><a href="/genesis/38-26.html">38:26</a></B> And Judah acknowledged [them], and said, She hath been <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son.
