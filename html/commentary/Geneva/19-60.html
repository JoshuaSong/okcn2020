O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> scattered us, thou hast been displeased; O turn thyself to us again. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>a</span>) These were certain songs after the note of which this psalm was sung. <BR>(<span>b</span>) Also called Sophene, which stands by Euphrates. <BR>(<span>c</span>) For when Saul was not able to resist the enemy, the people fled here and there: for they were not safe in their own homes. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps60_2"></a><B><a href="/psalms/60-2.html">60:2</a></B> Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> broken it: heal the breaches thereof; for it shaketh. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) As split with an earthquake. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps60_3"></a><B><a href="/psalms/60-3.html">60:3</a></B> Thou hast <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> shewed thy people hard things: thou hast made us to drink the wine of astonishment. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) You have handled your people sharply, in asking from them sense and judgment in that they aided Saul the wicked King, and punished him to whom God had given the just title of the realm. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps60_4"></a><B><a href="/psalms/60-4.html">60:4</a></B> Thou hast given <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth.
