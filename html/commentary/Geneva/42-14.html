The first said unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must needs go and see it: I pray thee have me excused. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>4</span>) For the most part even those to whom God has revealed himself are so mad, that any help which they have received of God they willingly turn into obstructions and hindrances. <BR>(<span>b</span>) On purpose, and a thing agreed upon before: for though they give different reasons why they cannot come, yet all of them agree in this, that they have their excuses so that they may not come to supper. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu14_19"></a><a name="Lu14_20"></a><a name="Lu14_21"></a><B><a href="/luke/14-21.html">14:21</a></B> So that servant came, and shewed his lord these things.
