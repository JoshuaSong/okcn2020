In these twelve chapters following he speaks of the plagues with which God would smite the strange nations (whom they knew) to declare that God chastised the Israelites as his children and these others as his enemies: and also that if God does not spare these who are ignorant, they must not think strange if he punishes them who have knowledge of his Law, and do not keep it. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa13_2"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/13-2.html">13:2</a></B> Lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain, exalt the voice to them, shake the <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>b</span>) That is, the Medes and Persians. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa13_3"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/13-3.html">13:3</a></B> I have commanded my <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> sanctified ones, I have also called my mighty ones for my anger, [even] them that rejoice in my <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> highness. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) That is, prepared and appointed to execute my judgments. <BR>(<span>d</span>) Who willingly go about to the work to which I appoint them, but how the wicked do this, read ( <a href="/isaiah/10-6.html">Isaiah 10:6</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa13_4"></a><a name="Isa13_5"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/13-5.html">13:5</a></B> They come from a far country, from the end of heaven, [even] the LORD, and the <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole land. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) The army of the Medes and the Persians against Babylon. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa13_6"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/13-6.html">13:6</a></B> Wail <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> ye;
