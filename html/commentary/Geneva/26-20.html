In the day when I chose Israel, and <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> lifted up my hand to the seed of the house of Jacob, and made myself known to them in the land of Egypt, when I lifted up my hand to them, saying, I [am] the LORD your God; <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) I swore that I would be their God, which manner of oath was observed from all antiquity, where they used to lift up their hands toward the heavens, acknowledging God to be the author of truth and the defender of it, and also the judge of the heart, wishing that he would take vengeance, if they concealed anything which they knew to be truth. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Eze20_6"></a><a name="Eze20_7"></a><B><a href="/ezekiel/20-7.html">20:7</a></B> Then said I to them, Cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes, <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt: I [am] the LORD your God. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>d</span>) God had forbidden them to make mention of the idols, ( <a href="/exodus/23-13.html">Exodus 23:13</a> ;

<BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>l</span>) Because they would not obey my laws, I gave them up to themselves that they should obey their own fantasies, as in ( <a href="/ezekiel/20-39.html">Ezekiel 20:39</a> ;  <a href="/romans/1-21.html">Romans 1:21</a>  <a href="/romans/1-24.html">Romans 1:24</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Eze20_26"></a><B><a href="/ezekiel/20-26.html">20:26</a></B> And I polluted them in their own <SUP><span>m</span></SUP> gifts, in that they caused to pass through [the fire] all the firstborn, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I [am] the LORD. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>m</span>) I condemned those things, and counted them as abominable, which they thought had been excellent and to have declared most zeal, ( <a href="/luke/16-15.html">Luke 16:15</a> ) for that which God required as most excellent they gave to their idols. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Eze20_27"></a><a name="Eze20_28"></a><B><a href="/ezekiel/20-28.html">20:28</a></B> <SUP><span>n</span></SUP> [For] when I had brought them into the land, [for] which I lifted up my hand to give it to them, then they saw every high hill, and all the thick trees, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering: there also they made their sweet savour, and poured out there their drink offerings. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>n</span>) Not only in the wilderness, when I brought them out of Egypt, but since I placed them in this land: which declares how prompt mans heart is to idolatry seeing that by no admonitions can he be drawn back. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Eze20_29"></a><B><a href="/ezekiel/20-29.html">20:29</a></B> Then I said to them, What [is] the high place to which ye go? And its name is called <SUP><span>o</span></SUP> Bamah to this day. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>o</span>) Which signifies a high place, declaring that they vaunted themselves of their idolatry and were not ashamed of it, though God had commanded them expressly that they should have no altar lifted on high by stairs, ( <a href="/exodus/20-26.html">Exodus 20:26</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Eze20_30"></a><a name="Eze20_31"></a><B><a href="/ezekiel/20-31.html">20:31</a></B> For when ye offer your gifts, when ye make your sons to pass through the fire, ye pollute yourselves with all your idols, even to this day: and shall I be enquired of by you, O house of Israel?
