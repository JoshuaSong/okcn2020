Truly <SUP><span>a</span></SUP> my soul waiteth upon God: from him [cometh] my salvation. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>a</span>) Though Satan tempted him to murmur against God, yet he bridled his affections, and resting on Gods promise. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps62_2"></a><B><a href="/psalms/62-2.html">62:2</a></B> <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> He only [is] my rock and my salvation; [he is] my defence; I shall not be greatly moved. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>b</span>) It appears by the often repetition of this word, that the prophet endured many temptations by resting on God and by patience he overcame them all. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps62_3"></a><B><a href="/psalms/62-3.html">62:3</a></B> How long will ye imagine mischief against a <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> man? ye shall be slain all of you: as a <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> bowing wall [shall ye be, and as] a tottering fence. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) He means himself, being the man whom God had appointed to the kingdom. <BR>(<span>d</span>) Though you seem to be in honour, yet God will suddenly destroy you. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps62_4"></a><a name="Ps62_5"></a><B><a href="/psalms/62-5.html">62:5</a></B> <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation [is] from him. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) David was greatly moved by these troubles, therefore he stirs up himself to trust in God. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps62_6"></a><a name="Ps62_7"></a><B><a href="/psalms/62-7.html">62:7</a></B> In God [is] my salvation and my <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> glory: the rock of my strength, [and] my refuge, [is] in God. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) These vehement and often repetitions were necessary to strengthen his faith against the horrible assault of Satan. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps62_8"></a><B><a href="/psalms/62-8.html">62:8</a></B> Trust in him at all times; [ye] people, <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> pour out your heart before him: God [is] a refuge for us. Selah. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) He admonishes us of our wicked nature, which would rather hide our sorrow and bite the bridle, than utter our grief to God to obtain remedy. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps62_9"></a><a name="Ps62_10"></a><B><a href="/psalms/62-10.html">62:10</a></B> Trust not in oppression, and <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> become not vain in robbery: if riches increase, set not your heart [upon them]. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) Give yourselves wholly to God by putting away all things that are contrary to his law. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps62_11"></a><B><a href="/psalms/62-11.html">62:11</a></B> God hath spoken <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> once; twice have I heard this; that power [belongeth] unto God. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) He has plainly born witness to his power, so that no one needs to doubt it. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps62_12"></a><B><a href="/psalms/62-12.html">62:12</a></B> Also unto thee, O Lord, [belongeth] mercy: for thou <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> renderest to every man according to his work. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) So that the wicked will feel your power, and the godly your mercy. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
