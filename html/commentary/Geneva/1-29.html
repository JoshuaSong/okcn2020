		<span><B><a href="/genesis/29.html">Chapter 29</a></B></span><P><span><a name="Ge29_1"></a><B><a href="/genesis/29-1.html">29:1</a></B> Then Jacob <SUP><span>a</span></SUP> went on his journey, and came into the land of the people of the east. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>a</span>) Or, "lifted up his feet". <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge29_2"></a><B><a href="/genesis/29-2.html">29:2</a></B> And he looked, and behold a well in the field, <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> and, lo, there [were] three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks: and a great stone [was] upon the wells mouth. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>b</span>) Thus he was directed by the providence of God, who brought him to Labans house. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge29_3"></a><a name="Ge29_4"></a><B><a href="/genesis/29-4.html">29:4</a></B> And Jacob said unto them, My <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> brethren, whence [be] ye? And they said, Of Haran [are] we. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) It seems that in those days the custom was to call even strangers, brethren. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge29_5"></a><a name="Ge29_6"></a><B><a href="/genesis/29-6.html">29:6</a></B> And he said unto them, <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> [Is] he well? And they said, [He is] well: and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) Or, "he is in peace?" by which the Hebrews mean prosperity. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge29_7"></a><a name="Ge29_8"></a><a name="Ge29_9"></a><a name="Ge29_10"></a><a name="Ge29_11"></a><a name="Ge29_12"></a><a name="Ge29_13"></a><B><a href="/genesis/29-13.html">29:13</a></B> And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sisters son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> all these things. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) That is, the reason why he departed from his fathers house, and what he saw during his journey. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge29_14"></a><B><a href="/genesis/29-14.html">29:14</a></B> And Laban said to him, Surely thou [art] my <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) That is, of my blood and kindred. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge29_15"></a><a name="Ge29_16"></a><a name="Ge29_17"></a><a name="Ge29_18"></a><a name="Ge29_19"></a><a name="Ge29_20"></a><B><a href="/genesis/29-20.html">29:20</a></B> And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him [but] a <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> few days, for the love he had to her. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) Meaning after the years were accomplished. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge29_21"></a><a name="Ge29_22"></a><a name="Ge29_23"></a><B><a href="/genesis/29-23.html">29:23</a></B> And <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) The reason Jacob was deceived was that in ancient times the wife was covered with a veil, when she was brought to her husband as a sign of purity and humbleness. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge29_24"></a><a name="Ge29_25"></a><a name="Ge29_26"></a><B><a href="/genesis/29-26.html">29:26</a></B> And Laban said, <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) He valued the profit he had from Jacobs service more than either his promise or the customs of the country, though he used custom for his excuse. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge29_27"></a><a name="Ge29_28"></a><a name="Ge29_29"></a><a name="Ge29_30"></a><a name="Ge29_31"></a><B><a href="/genesis/29-31.html">29:31</a></B> And when the LORD saw that Leah [was] hated, he <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> opened her womb: but Rachel [was] barren. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) This declares that often they who are despised by men are favoured by God. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge29_32"></a><B><a href="/genesis/29-32.html">29:32</a></B> And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Surely the <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> LORD hath looked upon my affliction; now therefore my husband will <SUP><span>m</span></SUP> love me. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>l</span>) By this it appears that she had sought help from God in her affliction. <BR>(<span>m</span>) For children are a great cause of mutual love between man and wife. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
