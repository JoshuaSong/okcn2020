		<span><B><a href="/jonah/4.html">Chapter 4</a></B></span><P><span><a name="Jon4_1"></a><B><a href="/jonah/4-1.html">4:1</a></B> But it displeased <SUP><span>a</span></SUP> Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>a</span>) Because by this he would be taken as a false prophet, and so the name of God, which he preached, would be blasphemed. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jon4_2"></a><B><a href="/jonah/4-2.html">4:2</a></B> And he prayed unto the LORD, and said, I pray thee, O LORD, [was] not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before unto <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> Tarshish: for I knew that thou [art] a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of the evil. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>b</span>) Read ( <a href="/jonah/1-3.html">Jonah 1:3</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jon4_3"></a><B><a href="/jonah/4-3.html">4:3</a></B> Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech thee, my life <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> from me; for [it is] better for me to die than to live. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) Thus he prayed from grief, fearing that Gods name by this forgiveness might be blasphemed, as though he sent his Prophets forth to make known his judgments in vain. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jon4_4"></a><B><a href="/jonah/4-4.html">4:4</a></B> Then said the LORD, Doest thou well to be <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> angry? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) Will you judge when I do things for my glory, and when I do not? <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jon4_5"></a><B><a href="/jonah/4-5.html">4:5</a></B> So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow, <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> till he might see what would become of the city. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) For he doubted as yet whether God would show them mercy or not, and therefore after forty days he departed out of the city, to see what God would do. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jon4_6"></a><B><a href="/jonah/4-6.html">4:6</a></B> And the LORD God prepared a <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> gourd, and made [it] to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) Which was a further means to cover him from the heat of the sun, as he remained in his booth. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jon4_7"></a><a name="Jon4_8"></a><a name="Jon4_9"></a><B><a href="/jonah/4-9.html">4:9</a></B> And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> angry, [even] unto death. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) This declares the great inconveniences into which Gods servants fall when they give place to their own affections, and do not in all things willingly submit themselves to God. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jon4_10"></a><a name="Jon4_11"></a><B><a href="/jonah/4-11.html">4:11</a></B> And should <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and [also] much cattle? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) Thus God mercifully reproves him who would pity himself and this gourd, and yet would keep God from showing his compassion to so many thousand people. <BR>(<span>i</span>) Meaning that they were children and infants. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
