This shows that they who have a charge and do not execute it should have it taken from them. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki22_5"</a><a name="2Ki22_6"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/22-7.html">22:7</a></B> Howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand, because they dealt <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> faithfully. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) So God provided him with faithful servants, seeing he went about so zealously to set forth the work of God. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki22_7"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/22-8.html">22:8</a></B> And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, I have found the <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) This was the copy that Moses left them, as it appears in ( <a href="/2-chronicles/34-14.html">2&nbsp;Chronicles 34:14</a> ), which either by the negligence of the priests had been lost, or else by the wickedness of idolatrous kings had been abolished. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki22_8"</a><a name="2Ki22_9"</a><a name="2Ki22_10"</a><a name="2Ki22_11"</a><a name="2Ki22_12"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/22-13.html">22:13</a></B> Go ye, <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> enquire of the LORD for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found: for great [is] the wrath of the LORD that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this book, to do according unto all that which is written concerning us. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) Meaning, to some prophet to whom God reveals the knowledge of things, as in ( <a href="/jeremiah/21-8.html">Jeremiah 21:8</a> ), though at other times they enquired the Lord by Urim and Thummim. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki22_13"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/22-14.html">22:14</a></B> So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asahiah, went unto Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> college;) and they communed with her. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) Or the house of doctrine, which was near the temple, and where the learned assembled to search the scriptures and the doctrine of the prophets. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki22_14"</a><a name="2Ki22_15"</a><a name="2Ki22_16"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/22-17.html">22:17</a></B> Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and shall not be quenched. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) The works of mans hand here signifies all that man invents beside the word of God, which are abominable in Gods service. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki22_17"</a><a name="2Ki22_18"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/22-19.html">22:19</a></B> Because thine heart was <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> tender, and thou hast humbled thyself before the LORD, when thou heardest what I spake against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard [thee], saith the LORD. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) Meaning, that he repented as they that do not repent are said to harden their heart, ( <a href="/psalms/95-8.html">Psalms 95:8</a> ). </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki22_19"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/22-20.html">22:20</a></B> Behold therefore, I will gather thee unto thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered into thy grave in <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> peace; and thine eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place. And they brought the king word again. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) Upon which we may gather that the anger of God is ready against the wicked when God takes his servants out of this world. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
