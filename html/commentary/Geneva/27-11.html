Behold, there shall stand up yet <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than [they] all: and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> all against the realm of Grecia. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>b</span>) Of which Cambyses that now reigned was the first, the second Smerdes, the third Darius the son of Hystaspis, and the fourth Xerxes, who all were enemies to the people of God, and stood against them. <BR>(<span>c</span>) For he raised up all the east countries to fight against the Grecians, and even though he had in his army 900,000 men, yet in four battles he was defeated, and fled away with shame. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Da11_3"></a><B><a href="/daniel/11-3.html">11:3</a></B> And a <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) That is, Alexander the Great. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Da11_4"></a><B><a href="/daniel/11-4.html">11:4</a></B> And when he shall stand up, <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> his kingdom shall be broken, <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> and shall be divided toward the <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> four winds of heaven; and not to his <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> posterity, nor according to <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> his dominion which he ruled: for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others beside <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> those. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) For when his estate was most flourishing, he overcame himself with drink, and so fell into a disease: or as some write, was poisoned by Cassander. <BR>(<span>f</span>) For his twelve chief princes first divided his kingdom among themselves. <BR>(<span>g</span>) After this his monarchy was divided into four: for Seleucus had Syria, Antigonus had Asia minor, Cassander had the kingdom of Macedonia, and Ptolemeus had Egypt. <BR>(<span>h</span>) Thus God avenged Alexanders ambition and cruelty, in causing his posterity to be murdered, partly by their fathers chief friends, and partly by one another. <BR>(<span>i</span>) None of these four will be able to be compared to the power of Alexander. <BR>(<span>k</span>) That is, his posterity having no part of it. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Da11_5"></a><B><a href="/daniel/11-5.html">11:5</a></B> And the <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> king of the south shall be strong, and [one] of <SUP><span>m</span></SUP> his princes; and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his dominion [shall be] a great dominion. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>l</span>) That is, Ptolemeus king of Egypt. <BR>(<span>m</span>) That is, Antiochus the son of Seleucus, and one of Alexanders princes will be more mighty: for he would have both Asia and Syria. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Da11_6"></a><B><a href="/daniel/11-6.html">11:6</a></B> And in the end of years they shall join themselves together;
