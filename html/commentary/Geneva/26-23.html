Thus [were] their names; Samaria [is] Aholah, and Jerusalem Aholibah. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) Aholah signifies a mansion or dwelling in herself, meaning Samaria, which was the royal city of Israel and Aholibah signifies my mansion in her, by which is meant Jerusalem, where Gods temple was. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Eze23_5"></a><B><a href="/ezekiel/23-5.html">23:5</a></B> And Aholah played the harlot when <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> she was mine;
