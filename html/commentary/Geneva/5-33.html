		<span><B><a href="/deuteronomy/33.html">Chapter 33</a></B></span><P><span><a name="De33_1"></a><B><a href="/deuteronomy/33-1.html">33:1</a></B> And this [is] the <SUP><span>a</span></SUP> blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>a</span>) This blessing contains not only a simple prayer, but an assurance of the effect of it. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="De33_2"></a><B><a href="/deuteronomy/33-2.html">33:2</a></B> And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> thousands of saints: from his right hand [went] a fiery law for them. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>b</span>) Meaning, infinite angels. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="De33_3"></a><B><a href="/deuteronomy/33-3.html">33:3</a></B> Yea, he loved the people; <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> all his saints [are] in thy hand: and they sat down at <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> thy feet; [every one] shall receive of thy words. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) Hebrew, his saints, that is, the children of Israel. <BR>(<span>d</span>) As thy disciples. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="De33_4"></a><B><a href="/deuteronomy/33-4.html">33:4</a></B> Moses commanded us a law, [even] the <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> inheritance of the congregation of Jacob. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) To us and our successors. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="De33_5"></a><a name="De33_6"></a><B><a href="/deuteronomy/33-6.html">33:6</a></B> Let <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> Reuben live, and not die; and let [not] his men be few. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) Reuben will be one of the tribes of Gods people, though for his sin his honour is diminished, and his family but small. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="De33_7"></a><B><a href="/deuteronomy/33-7.html">33:7</a></B> And this [is the blessing] of Judah: and he said, Hear, LORD, the voice of Judah, and bring him unto his people: let his hands be <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> sufficient for him; and be thou an help [to him] from his enemies. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>g</span>) Signifying, that he would barely obtain Jacobs promise, ( <a href="/genesis/49-8.html">Genesis 49:8</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="De33_8"></a><a name="De33_9"></a><B><a href="/deuteronomy/33-9.html">33:9</a></B> Who said unto his father and to his mother, <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> I have not seen him; neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own children: for they have observed thy word, and kept thy covenant. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>h</span>) He preferred Gods glory to all natural affection, ( <a href="/exodus/28-30.html">Exodus 28:30</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="De33_10"></a><a name="De33_11"></a><B><a href="/deuteronomy/33-11.html">33:11</a></B> Bless, LORD, his substance, and accept the work of his hands: smite <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> through the loins of them that rise against him, and of them that hate him, that they rise not again. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) He declares that the ministers of God have many enemies, and therefore need to be prayed for. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="De33_12"></a><B><a href="/deuteronomy/33-12.html">33:12</a></B> [And] of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the LORD shall <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> dwell in safety by him; [and the LORD] shall cover him all the day long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) Because the temple would be built in Zion, which was in the tribe of Benjamin, he shows that God would dwell with him there. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="De33_13"></a><a name="De33_14"></a><a name="De33_15"></a><a name="De33_16"></a><B><a href="/deuteronomy/33-16.html">33:16</a></B> And for the precious things of the earth and fulness thereof, and [for] the good will of him that dwelt in the <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> bush: let [the blessing] come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the top of the head of him [that was] separated from his brethren. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>l</span>) Which was God appearing to Moses, ( <a href="/exodus/3-2.html">Exodus 3:2</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="De33_17"></a><a name="De33_18"></a><B><a href="/deuteronomy/33-18.html">33:18</a></B> And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy <SUP><span>m</span></SUP> going out; and, Issachar, in thy tents. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>m</span>) In thy prosperous voyages on the sea, ( <a href="/genesis/49-13.html">Genesis 49:13</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="De33_19"></a><B><a href="/deuteronomy/33-19.html">33:19</a></B> They shall call the people unto the mountain; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness: for <SUP><span>n</span></SUP> they shall suck [of] the abundance of the seas, and [of] treasures hid in the sand. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>n</span>) The tribe of Zebulun. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="De33_20"></a><a name="De33_21"></a><B><a href="/deuteronomy/33-21.html">33:21</a></B> And he provided the first part for himself, because there, [in] a portion of the <SUP><span>o</span></SUP> lawgiver, [was he] seated; and he came with the heads of the people, he executed the justice of the LORD, and his judgments with Israel. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>o</span>) So the portion of the Gadites, and others on this side of the Jordan was Gods, though it was not so known. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="De33_22"></a><a name="De33_23"></a><B><a href="/deuteronomy/33-23.html">33:23</a></B> And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favour, and full with the blessing of the LORD: possess thou <SUP><span>p</span></SUP> the west and the south. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>p</span>) Meaning, near the sea. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="De33_24"></a><a name="De33_25"></a><B><a href="/deuteronomy/33-25.html">33:25</a></B> Thy shoes [shall be] <SUP><span>q</span></SUP> iron and brass; and as thy days, [so shall] thy strength [be]. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>q</span>) You will be strong or, your country full of metal. It seems that Simeon is left out, because he was under Judah, and his portion of his inheritance, ( <a href="/joshua/19-9.html">Joshua 19:9</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="De33_26"></a><a name="De33_27"></a><a name="De33_28"></a><B><a href="/deuteronomy/33-28.html">33:28</a></B> Israel then shall dwell in safety alone: <SUP><span>r</span></SUP> the fountain of Jacob [shall be] upon a land of corn and wine; also his heavens shall drop down dew. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>r</span>) Who was plentiful in issue as a fountain. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="De33_29"></a><B><a href="/deuteronomy/33-29.html">33:29</a></B> Happy [art] thou, O Israel: who [is] like unto thee, O people saved by the LORD, the shield of thy help, and who [is] the sword of thy excellency! and <SUP><span>s</span></SUP> thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee; and thou shalt tread upon their high places. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>s</span>) Your enemies for fear shall lie and pretend to be in subjection. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
