[Let] the potsherd [contend] with the potsherds of the earth. Shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it, What makest thou? or thy work, <SUP><span>m</span></SUP> He hath no hands? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>l</span>) By this he bridles their impatience, who in adversity and trouble murmur against God, and will not tarry his pleasure: willing that man would match with his like, and not contend against God. <BR>(<span>m</span>) That is, it is not perfectly made. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa45_10"></a><a name="Isa45_11"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/45-11.html">45:11</a></B> Thus saith the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker, Ask me <SUP><span>n</span></SUP> of things to come concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands command ye me. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>n</span>) Instead of murmuring, humble yourselves and ask what you will for the consolation of my children, and you will be sure of it as you are of these things which are at your command. Some read it with an interrogation, and make it the application of the comparison. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa45_12"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/45-12.html">45:12</a></B> I have made the earth, and created man upon it: I, [even] my hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their <SUP><span>o</span></SUP> host have I commanded. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>o</span>) That is, the stars. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa45_13"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/45-13.html">45:13</a></B> I have raised <SUP><span>p</span></SUP> him up in righteousness, and I will direct all his ways: he shall build my city, and he shall let go my captives, not for <SUP><span>q</span></SUP> price nor reward, saith the LORD of hosts. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>p</span>) That is, Cyrus, that I may show by him the faithfulness of my promise in delivering my people. <BR>(<span>q</span>) Meaning, freely and without ransom, or any grievous condition. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa45_14"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/45-14.html">45:14</a></B> Thus saith the LORD, The labour <SUP><span>r</span></SUP> of Egypt, and merchandise of Cush and of the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over to thee, and they shall be <SUP><span>s</span></SUP> thine: they shall come after thee; in chains they shall come over, and they shall fall down to thee, they shall make supplication to thee, [saying], Surely God [is] in thee; and [there is] none else, [there is] no God. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>r</span>) These people were tributaries to the Persians, and so king Artahshashte gave this money toward the building of the temple, ( <a href="/ezra/7-27.html">Ezra 7:27</a> ). <BR>(<span>s</span>) While they were your enemies, they will now honour you and you will rule them: which was accomplished in the time of Christ. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa45_15"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/45-15.html">45:15</a></B> Verily thou [art] a God that <SUP><span>t</span></SUP> hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the Saviour. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>t</span>) By this he exhorts the Jews to patience, though their deliverance is deferred for a time: showing that they would not repent their long patience, but the wicked and idolaters will be destroyed. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa45_16"></a><a name="Isa45_17"></a><a name="Isa45_18"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/45-18.html">45:18</a></B> For thus saith the LORD that created the heavens; God himself that formed the earth and made it; he hath established it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be <SUP><span>u</span></SUP> inhabited: I [am] the LORD; and [there is] none else. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>u</span>) That is, of men, but chiefly of his Church. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa45_19"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/45-19.html">45:19</a></B> I have not spoken in secret, <SUP><span>x</span></SUP> in a dark place of the earth: I have not said to the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain: I the LORD speak righteousness, I declare things that are right. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>x</span>) As do the false gods, who give uncertain answers. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa45_20"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/45-20.html">45:20</a></B> Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, <SUP><span>y</span></SUP> ye [that have] escaped of the nations: they have no knowledge that set up the wood of their graven image, and pray to a god [that] cannot save. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>y</span>) All you idolaters who though you seem to have worldly dignity yet in Gods sight you are vile and abject. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa45_21"></a><a name="Isa45_22"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/45-22.html">45:22</a></B> Look to me, and be ye saved, all <SUP><span>z</span></SUP> the ends of the earth: for I [am] God, and [there is] none else. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>z</span>) He calls the idolaters to repentance, willing them to look on him with the eye of faith. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa45_23"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/45-23.html">45:23</a></B> I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth [in] <SUP><span>a</span></SUP> righteousness, and shall not return, That to me every <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>a</span>) That is, that the thing which I have promise will be faithfully performed. <BR>(<span>b</span>) The knowledge of God and the true worshipping will be through all the world, ( <a href="/romans/14-11.html">Romans 14:11</a> ;  <a href="default.aspx?reference=+2:10"> 2:10</a> ) by which he signifies that we must not only serve God in heart, but declare the same also by outward profession. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa45_24"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/45-24.html">45:24</a></B> Surely, <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> shall [one] say, in the LORD have I righteousness and strength: [even] to him shall [men] come; and all that are <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> incensed against him shall be ashamed. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) Meaning the faithful will feel and confess this. <BR>(<span>d</span>) All the contemners of God. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
