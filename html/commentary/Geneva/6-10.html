[Is] not this written in the book of <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) Some read, the book of the righteous, meaning Moses: the Chaldea text reads, in the book of the Law, but it is likely that it was a book thus named, which is now lost. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jos10_14"></a><B><a href="/joshua/10-14.html">10:14</a></B> And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the LORD hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the LORD <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> fought for Israel. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) By taking away the enemies hearts and destroying them with the hail stones. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jos10_15"></a><a name="Jos10_16"></a><a name="Jos10_17"></a><a name="Jos10_18"></a><a name="Jos10_19"></a><a name="Jos10_20"></a><a name="Jos10_21"></a><B><a href="/joshua/10-21.html">10:21</a></B> And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) Or in safety, so that none gave them as much as an evil word. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jos10_22"></a><a name="Jos10_23"></a><a name="Jos10_24"></a><B><a href="/joshua/10-24.html">10:24</a></B> And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the captains of the men of war which went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) Signifying what would become of the rest of Gods enemies, seeing that kings themselves were not spared. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jos10_25"></a><a name="Jos10_26"></a><a name="Jos10_27"></a><a name="Jos10_28"></a><a name="Jos10_29"></a><a name="Jos10_30"></a><a name="Jos10_31"></a><a name="Jos10_32"></a><a name="Jos10_33"></a><a name="Jos10_34"></a><a name="Jos10_35"></a><a name="Jos10_36"></a><a name="Jos10_37"></a><a name="Jos10_38"></a><a name="Jos10_39"></a><a name="Jos10_40"></a><B><a href="/joshua/10-40.html">10:40</a></B> So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the south, and of the <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> vale, and of the springs, and all their kings: he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD God of Israel commanded. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) Some read, Ashedoth, which signifies the descents of the hills. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jos10_41"></a><a name="Jos10_42"></a><B><a href="/joshua/10-42.html">10:42</a></B> And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> one time, because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) In one battle. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jos10_43"></a><B><a href="/joshua/10-43.html">10:43</a></B> And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> Gilgal. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>l</span>) Where the ark was, there to give thanks for their victories. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
