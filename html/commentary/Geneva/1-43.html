If I be <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> bereaved [of my children], I am bereaved. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) Our main trust should be in God, not in worldly means. <BR>(<span>d</span>) He speaks these words not so much in despair, but to make his sons more careful to return with their brother. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge43_15"></a><a name="Ge43_16"></a><a name="Ge43_17"></a><a name="Ge43_18"></a><B><a href="/genesis/43-18.html">43:18</a></B> And the men were <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> afraid, because they were brought into Josephs house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) So the judgment of God weighed on their consciences. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge43_19"></a><a name="Ge43_20"></a><a name="Ge43_21"></a><a name="Ge43_22"></a><a name="Ge43_23"></a><B><a href="/genesis/43-23.html">43:23</a></B> And he said, Peace [be] to you, fear not: <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money.
