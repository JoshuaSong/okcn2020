Give ear to <SUP><span>a</span></SUP> my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my supplication. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>a</span>) The earnestness of his prayer declares the vehemency of his grief in so much as he is compelled to burst out into cries. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps55_2"></a><a name="Ps55_3"></a><B><a href="/psalms/55-3.html">55:3</a></B> Because of the <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked: for <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>b</span>) For the threatenings of Saul and his adherents. <BR>(<span>c</span>) They have defamed me as a wicked person, or they have imagined my destruction. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps55_4"></a><a name="Ps55_5"></a><B><a href="/psalms/55-5.html">55:5</a></B> Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> overwhelmed me. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) There was no part of him that was not astonished with extreme fear. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps55_6"></a><B><a href="/psalms/55-6.html">55:6</a></B> And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! [for then] would I <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> fly away, and be at rest. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) Fear had driven him to so great distress, that he wished to be hid in some wilderness, and to be banished from that kingdom which God had promised that he should enjoy. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps55_7"></a><a name="Ps55_8"></a><B><a href="/psalms/55-8.html">55:8</a></B> I would hasten my escape <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> from the windy storm [and] tempest. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) From the cruel rage and tyranny of Saul. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps55_9"></a><B><a href="/psalms/55-9.html">55:9</a></B> Destroy, O Lord, [and] <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> divide their tongues: for I have seen violence and strife in the city. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) As in the confusion of Babylon when the wicked conspired against God. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps55_10"></a><B><a href="/psalms/55-10.html">55:10</a></B> Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> mischief also and sorrow [are] in the midst of it. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) All laws and good orders are broken and only vice and dissolution reigns under Saul. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps55_11"></a><a name="Ps55_12"></a><B><a href="/psalms/55-12.html">55:12</a></B> For [it was] not an <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> enemy [that] reproached me; then I could have borne [it]: neither [was it] he that hated me [that] did magnify [himself] against me; then I would have hid myself from him: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) If my open enemy had sought by hurt, I could better have avoided him. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps55_13"></a><B><a href="/psalms/55-13.html">55:13</a></B> But [it was] thou, a man mine <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) Who was not only joined to me in friendship and counsel in worldly matters, but also in religion. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps55_14"></a><a name="Ps55_15"></a><B><a href="/psalms/55-15.html">55:15</a></B> Let death seize upon them, [and] let them <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> go down quick into hell: for wickedness [is] in their dwellings, [and] among them. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>l</span>) As Korah, Dathan and Abiram. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps55_16"></a><a name="Ps55_17"></a><B><a href="/psalms/55-17.html">55:17</a></B> Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, <SUP><span>m</span></SUP> and cry aloud: and he shall hear my voice. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>m</span>) Which signifies a servants mind and sure trust to obtain his portion, which made him earnest at all times in prayer. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps55_18"></a><B><a href="/psalms/55-18.html">55:18</a></B> He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle [that was] against me: for there were <SUP><span>n</span></SUP> many with me. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>n</span>) Even the angels of God fought on my side against my enemies, ( <a href="/2-kings/6-16.html">2&nbsp;Kings 6:16</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps55_19"></a><B><a href="/psalms/55-19.html">55:19</a></B> God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old.
