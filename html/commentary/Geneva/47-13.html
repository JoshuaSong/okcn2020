		<span><B><a href="/2-corinthians/13.html">Chapter 13</a></B></span><P><span><a name="2Co13_1"</a><a name="2Co13_2"</a> <B><a href="/2-corinthians/13-3.html">13:3</a></B> <SUP><span>1</span></SUP> Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is <SUP><span>a</span></SUP> mighty in you. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>1</span>) A most sharp reprehension, because, while they despise the apostles admonitions, they tempt Christs own patience: and also while they condemn him as wretched and miserable, they lay nothing against him, which is not common to him with Christ. <BR>(<span>a</span>) And will be most mighty to be avenged upon you, when need will be. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Co13_3"</a><B><a href="/2-corinthians/13-4.html">13:4</a></B> For though he was crucified through <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>b</span>) Regarding that base form of a servant which he took upon him when he abased himself. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Co13_4"</a><B><a href="/2-corinthians/13-5.html">13:5</a></B> <SUP><span>2</span></SUP> Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>2</span>) He confirms that which he spoke about the power of God appearing in his ministry, and he gathers by the mutual relation between the peoples faith and the ministers preaching, that they must either reverence his apostleship, upon whose doctrine their faith is grounded, or they must condemn themselves of infidelity, and must confess themselves not to be of Christs body. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Co13_5"</a><B><a href="/2-corinthians/13-6.html">13:6</a></B> <SUP><span>3</span></SUP> But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>3</span>) He appeases that sharpness, trusting that they will show themselves towards their faithful apostle, able and willing to be taught. And he also adds this, that he does not seek his own fame and estimation, so that they may serve their saviour, which is the only mark that he shoots at. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Co13_6"</a><B><a href="/2-corinthians/13-7.html">13:7</a></B> Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we be as <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> reprobates. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) In mens judgment. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Co13_7"</a><a name="2Co13_8"</a><B><a href="/2-corinthians/13-9.html">13:9</a></B> For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this also we wish, [even] your <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> perfection. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) That all things may be in good order among you, and the members of the church restored into their place, which have been shaken and are out of place. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Co13_9"</a><a name="2Co13_10"</a><B><a href="/2-corinthians/13-11.html">13:11</a></B> <SUP><span>4</span></SUP> Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>4</span>) A brief exhortation, but yet such a one as comprehends all the parts of a Christian mans life. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Co13_11"</a><B><a href="/2-corinthians/13-12.html">13:12</a></B> <SUP><span>5</span></SUP> Greet one another with an holy kiss. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>5</span>) He salutes them familiarly, and in conclusion wishes well to them. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
