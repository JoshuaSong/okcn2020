Because they have made [you] desolate, and swallowed you up on every side, that ye might be a possession to the rest of the nations, and ye are taken up in the lips of <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> talkers, and [are] an infamy of the people: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) You are made a matter of talk and derision to all the world. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Eze36_4"></a><a name="Eze36_5"></a><B><a href="/ezekiel/36-5.html">36:5</a></B> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Surely in the fire of my jealousy have I spoken against the rest of the nations, and against all Edom, who have <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> appointed my land into their possession with the joy of all [their] heart, with despiteful minds, to cast it out for a prey. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) They appointed with themselves to have it, and therefore came with Nebuchadnezzar against Jerusalem for this purpose. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Eze36_6"></a><B><a href="/ezekiel/36-6.html">36:6</a></B> Prophesy therefore concerning the land of Israel, and say to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my fury, because ye have borne the <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> shame of the nations: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) Because you have been a laughing stock to them. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Eze36_7"></a><B><a href="/ezekiel/36-7.html">36:7</a></B> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I have <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> lifted up my hand, Surely the nations that [are] about you, they shall bear their shame. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) By making a solemn oath. <I>See <a href="/commentaries/geneva-study-bible/ezekiel/ezekiel-20.html">Ezekiel 20:5</a></I> <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Eze36_8"></a><B><a href="/ezekiel/36-8.html">36:8</a></B> But ye, O mountains of Israel, ye shall <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> shoot forth your branches, and yield your fruit to my people of Israel; for they are soon to come. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) God declares his mercies and goodness toward his Church, who still preserves his, even when he destroys his enemies. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Eze36_9"></a><a name="Eze36_10"></a><a name="Eze36_11"></a><B><a href="/ezekiel/36-11.html">36:11</a></B> And I will multiply upon you man and beast; and they shall increase and bring fruit: and I will settle you according to your old estates, and will do better [to you] than <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> at your beginnings: and ye shall know that I [am] the LORD. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) Which was accomplished under Christ, to whom all these temporal deliverances directed them. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Eze36_12"></a><B><a href="/ezekiel/36-12.html">36:12</a></B> Yea, I will cause men to walk <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> upon you, [even] my people Israel;

Because they say to you, Thou <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> [land] devourest men, and hast bereaved thy nations; <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) This the enemies imputed as the reproach of the land, which God did for the sins of the people according to his just judgments. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Eze36_14"></a><a name="Eze36_15"></a><a name="Eze36_16"></a><a name="Eze36_17"></a><a name="Eze36_18"></a><a name="Eze36_19"></a><a name="Eze36_20"></a><a name="Eze36_21"></a><B><a href="/ezekiel/36-21.html">36:21</a></B> But I had pity for my holy <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations, to which they went. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>l</span>) And therefore would not permit my Name to be had in contempt, as the heathen would have reproached me, if I had allowed my Church to perish. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Eze36_22"></a><B><a href="/ezekiel/36-22.html">36:22</a></B> Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I do not [this] for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for my <SUP><span>m</span></SUP> holy names sake, which ye have profaned among the nations, to which ye went. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>m</span>) This excludes from man all dignity and means to deserve anything by, seeing that God refers the whole to himself and that only for the glory of his holy Name. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Eze36_23"></a><a name="Eze36_24"></a><a name="Eze36_25"></a><B><a href="/ezekiel/36-25.html">36:25</a></B> Then will I sprinkle clean <SUP><span>n</span></SUP> water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>n</span>) That is, his spirit by which he reforms the heart and regenerates his. <I>See <a href="/commentaries/geneva-study-bible/isaiah/isaiah-44.html">Isaiah 44:3</a></I> <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Eze36_26"></a><a name="Eze36_27"></a><a name="Eze36_28"></a><a name="Eze36_29"></a><B><a href="/ezekiel/36-29.html">36:29</a></B> I will also save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will call for the <SUP><span>o</span></SUP> grain, and will increase it, and lay no famine upon you. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>o</span>) Under the abundance of temporal benefits he concludes the spiritual graces. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Eze36_30"></a><a name="Eze36_31"></a><B><a href="/ezekiel/36-31.html">36:31</a></B> Then shall ye remember your own evil ways, and your doings that [were] not good, and shall <SUP><span>p</span></SUP> lothe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>p</span>) You will come to true repentance and think yourselves unworthy to be of the number of Gods creatures, for your ingratitude against him. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Eze36_32"></a><a name="Eze36_33"></a><a name="Eze36_34"></a><a name="Eze36_35"></a><a name="Eze36_36"></a><B><a href="/ezekiel/36-36.html">36:36</a></B> Then the nations that are left around you shall <SUP><span>q</span></SUP> know that I the LORD build the ruined [places, and] plant that which was desolate: I the LORD have spoken [it], and I will do [it]. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>q</span>) He declares that it ought not to be referred to the soil or plentifulness of the earth that any country is rich and abundant, but only to Gods mercies, as his plagues and curses declare, when he makes it barren. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
