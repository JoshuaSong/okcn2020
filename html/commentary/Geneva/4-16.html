<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>a</span>) Or let it suffice you: meaning, to have abused them this long. <BR>(<span>b</span>) All are equally holy: therefore no one should be preferred above other: thus the wicked reason against Gods ordinance. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Nu16_4"></a><a name="Nu16_5"></a><B><a href="/numbers/16-5.html">16:5</a></B> And he spake unto Korah and unto all his company, saying, Even to morrow the LORD will shew who [are] his, and [who is] holy; and will cause [him] to come near unto him: even [him] whom he hath <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> chosen will he cause to come near unto him. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) To be the priest and to offer. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Nu16_6"></a><a name="Nu16_7"></a><B><a href="/numbers/16-7.html">16:7</a></B> And put fire therein, and put incense in them before the LORD to morrow: and it shall be [that] the man whom the LORD doth choose, he [shall be] holy: <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> [ye take] too much upon you, ye sons of Levi. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) He lays the same to their charge justly, with which they wrongfully charged him. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Nu16_8"></a><a name="Nu16_9"></a><a name="Nu16_10"></a><B><a href="/numbers/16-10.html">16:10</a></B> And he hath brought thee near [to <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> him], and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee: and seek ye the priesthood also?
