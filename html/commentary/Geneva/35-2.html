And even though God does not execute this according to mans hasty affections, yet the issue of both is certain at his appointed time. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Hab2_4"></a><B><a href="/habakkuk/2-4.html">2:4</a></B> Behold, <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> his soul [which] is lifted up is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>d</span>) To trust in himself, or in any worldly thing, is never to be at peace: for the only rest is to trust in God by faith; ( <a href="/romans/1-17.html">Romans 1:17</a> ;  <a href="/galatians/3-11.html">Galatians 3:11</a> ;  <a href="/hebrews/10-38.html">Hebrews 10:38</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Hab2_5"></a><B><a href="/habakkuk/2-5.html">2:5</a></B> Yea also, because <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> he transgresseth by wine, [he is] a proud man, neither keepeth at home, who enlargeth his desire as hell, and [is] as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth to him all nations, and heapeth to him all people: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) He compares the proud and covetous man to a drunkard that is without reason and sense, whom God will punish and make a laughing stock to all the world: and this he speaks for the comfort of the godly, and against the Chaldeans. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Hab2_6"></a><B><a href="/habakkuk/2-6.html">2:6</a></B> Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that increaseth [that which is] not his! <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> how long? and to him that ladeth himself with thick clay! <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) Signifying that all the world will wish the destruction of tyrants, and that by their oppression and covetousness, they heap but upon themselves more heavy burdens: for the more they get, the more are they troubled. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Hab2_7"></a><B><a href="/habakkuk/2-7.html">2:7</a></B> Shall <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> they not rise suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that shall oppress thee, and thou shalt be for booty to them?

<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) Meaning, that God will not defer his vengeance long, but will come and destroy all their labours, as though they were consumed with fire. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Hab2_14"></a><B><a href="/habakkuk/2-14.html">2:14</a></B> For the earth shall <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>l</span>) In the destruction of the Babylonians his glory will appear through all the world. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Hab2_15"></a><B><a href="/habakkuk/2-15.html">2:15</a></B> Woe to him that giveth his neighbour <SUP><span>m</span></SUP> drink, that puttest thy bottle to [him], and makest [him] drunk also, that thou mayest look on their nakedness! <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>m</span>) He reproaches by this the king of Babylon, who as he was drunken with covetousness and cruelty, so he provoked others to the same, and inflamed them by his madness, and so in the end brought them to shame. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Hab2_16"></a><B><a href="/habakkuk/2-16.html">2:16</a></B> Thou art filled with shame <SUP><span>n</span></SUP> for glory: drink thou also, and let thy shame come upon thee: the cup of the LORDS right hand shall be turned to thee, and utter shame [shall be] on thy glory. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>n</span>) Whereas you thought to have the glory of these your doings, they will turn to your shame: for you will drink of the same cup with others in your turn. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Hab2_17"></a><B><a href="/habakkuk/2-17.html">2:17</a></B> For the <SUP><span>o</span></SUP> violence of Lebanon shall cover thee, and the spoil of beasts, [which] made them afraid, because of mens blood, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell in it. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>o</span>) Because the Babylonians were cruel not only against other nations, but also against the people of God, which is meant by Lebanon and the beast in it, he shows that the same cruelly will be executed against them. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Hab2_18"></a><B><a href="/habakkuk/2-18.html">2:18</a></B> What profiteth the graven <SUP><span>p</span></SUP> image that its maker hath engraved it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the maker of his work trusteth in it, to make dumb idols? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>p</span>) He shows that the Babylonian gods could not help them at all, for they were but blocks or stones. <I>See </I> <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Hab2_19"></a><B><a href="/habakkuk/2-19.html">2:19</a></B> Woe to him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise, it shall teach! <SUP><span>q</span></SUP> Behold, it [is] laid over with gold and silver, and [there is] no breath at all within it. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>q</span>) If you will consider what it is, and how it has neither breath nor life, but is a dead thing. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
