I will <SUP><span>a</span></SUP> sing of mercy and judgment: unto thee, O LORD, will I sing. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>a</span>) David considers what manner of King he would be, when God would place him in the throne, promising openly, that he would be merciful and just. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps101_2"></a><B><a href="/psalms/101-2.html">101:2</a></B> I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> O when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>b</span>) Though as yet you deferred to place me in the kingly dignity, yet I will give myself to wisdom and uprightness being a private man. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps101_3"></a><B><a href="/psalms/101-3.html">101:3</a></B> I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> the work of them that turn aside; [it] shall not cleave to me. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) He shows that magistrates do not do their duties, unless they are enemies to all vice. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps101_4"></a><a name="Ps101_5"></a><B><a href="/psalms/101-5.html">101:5</a></B> Whoso privily <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off: him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not I suffer. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) In promising to punish these vices, which are most pernicious in them that are about Kings, he declares that he will punish all. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps101_6"></a><B><a href="/psalms/101-6.html">101:6</a></B> Mine eyes [shall be] upon the <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) He shows what the true use of the sword is, to punish the wicked and to maintain the good. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps101_7"></a><a name="Ps101_8"></a><B><a href="/psalms/101-8.html">101:8</a></B> <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may cut off all wicked doers from the city of the LORD. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) Magistrates must immediately punish vice, lest it grow to further inconvenience; and if heathen magistrates are bound to do this, how much more they who have the charge of the Church of God? <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
