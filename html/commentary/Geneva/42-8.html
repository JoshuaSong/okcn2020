And they launched forth. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>5</span>) It is expedient for us sometimes to come into extreme danger, as though Christ was not with us, that we may have a better test, both of his power, and also of our weakness. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu8_23"></a><B><a href="/luke/8-23.html">8:23</a></B> But as they sailed he fell <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> they were filled [with water], and were in jeopardy. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) Jesus fell asleep, and it appears that he was very fast asleep, because they called him twice before he awoke. <BR>(<span>i</span>) Not the disciples, but the ship. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu8_24"></a><a name="Lu8_25"></a><a name="Lu8_26"></a><a name="Lu8_27"></a><B><a href="/luke/8-27.html">8:27</a></B> <SUP><span>6</span></SUP> And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, neither abode in [any] house, but in the tombs. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>6</span>) Christ shows by casting out a legion of demons by his word alone that his heavenly power was appointed to deliver men from the slavery of the devil: but foolish men for the most part will not redeem this so excellent grace freely offered unto them if it means the loss of even the least of their wealth. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu8_28"></a><a name="Lu8_29"></a><B><a href="/luke/8-29.html">8:29</a></B> (For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he brake the bands, <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> and was driven of the devil into the wilderness.) <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) By force and violence, as a horse when he is spurred. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu8_30"></a><a name="Lu8_31"></a><a name="Lu8_32"></a><a name="Lu8_33"></a><a name="Lu8_34"></a><a name="Lu8_35"></a><a name="Lu8_36"></a><a name="Lu8_37"></a><a name="Lu8_38"></a><a name="Lu8_39"></a><B><a href="/luke/8-39.html">8:39</a></B> Return to thine own house, and shew how great things God hath done unto thee. And he went his way, and published <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>l</span>) That is, the city of the Gadarenes: and though Mark says that he preached it in Decapolis, these accounts do not differ, for Pliny records in lib. 5, chap. 18, that Gadara is a town of Decapolis: so that Decapolis was partly on this side of Jordan, and partly on the other side. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu8_40"></a><B><a href="/luke/8-40.html">8:40</a></B> And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people <SUP><span>m</span></SUP> [gladly] received him: for they were all waiting for him. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>m</span>) The multitude was glad he had come again, and greatly rejoiced. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu8_41"></a><B><a href="/luke/8-41.html">8:41</a></B> <SUP><span>7</span></SUP> And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus feet, and besought him that he would come into his house: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>7</span>) Christ shows by a double miracle that he is Lord both of life and death. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu8_42"></a><a name="Lu8_43"></a><B><a href="/luke/8-43.html">8:43</a></B> And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her <SUP><span>n</span></SUP> living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any, <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>n</span>) All that she had to live upon. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu8_44"></a><a name="Lu8_45"></a><a name="Lu8_46"></a><a name="Lu8_47"></a><a name="Lu8_48"></a><a name="Lu8_49"></a><a name="Lu8_50"></a><a name="Lu8_51"></a><a name="Lu8_52"></a><B><a href="/luke/8-52.html">8:52</a></B> And all wept, and <SUP><span>o</span></SUP> bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>o</span>) The word signifies to beat and strike, and is used in the mournings and lamentations that are at burials, at which times men used this type of behaviour. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu8_53"></a><a name="Lu8_54"></a><a name="Lu8_55"></a><B><a href="/luke/8-55.html">8:55</a></B> And her spirit came again, and she <SUP><span>p</span></SUP> arose straightway: and he commanded to give her meat. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>p</span>) The corpse was lying there, and then the young girl received life, and rose out of the bed, that all the world might see that she was not only restored to life, but also void of all sickness. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
