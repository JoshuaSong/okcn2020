The Hebrews thought that they were the Amalekites, but as it appeared by ( <a href="/2-chronicles/20-10.html">2&nbsp;Chronicles 20:10</a> ) they were the Idumeans of mount Seir. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ch20_1"</a><B><a href="/2-chronicles/20-2.html">20:2</a></B> Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying, There cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> sea on this side Syria; and, behold, they [be] in Hazazontamar, which [is] Engedi. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>b</span>) Called the Dead sea, where God destroyed the five cities because of their sin. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ch20_2"</a><B><a href="/2-chronicles/20-3.html">20:3</a></B> And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> to seek the LORD, and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) This declares what the fear of the godly is, which is the prick to stir them to prayer and to depend on the Lord, while it moves the wicked either to seek after worldly means and policies or else to fall into despair. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ch20_3"</a><a name="2Ch20_4"</a><a name="2Ch20_5"</a><a name="2Ch20_6"</a><B><a href="/2-chronicles/20-7.html">20:7</a></B> [Art] not thou our God, [who] didst drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel, and <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> gavest it to the seed of Abraham thy friend for ever? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) He grounds his prayer on Gods power, by which he is able to help and also on his mercy, which he will continue toward his, as he has once chosen them and began to show his graces toward them. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ch20_7"</a><a name="2Ch20_8"</a><B><a href="/2-chronicles/20-9.html">20:9</a></B> If, [when] evil cometh upon us, [as] the <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> sword, judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we stand before this house, and in thy presence, (for thy name <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> [is] in this house,) and cry unto thee in our affliction, then thou wilt hear and help. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) Meaning war which comes by Gods just judgments for our sins. <BR>(<span>f</span>) That is, it is here called on and you declared your presence and favour. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ch20_9"</a><a name="2Ch20_10"</a><a name="2Ch20_11"</a><B><a href="/2-chronicles/20-12.html">20:12</a></B> O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do: but our eyes <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> [are] upon thee. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) We only put our trust in you, and wait for our deliverance from heaven. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ch20_12"</a><B><a href="/2-chronicles/20-13.html">20:13</a></B> And all Judah stood <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> before the LORD, with their little ones, their wives, and their children. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) That is, before the ark of the covenant. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ch20_13"</a><B><a href="/2-chronicles/20-14.html">20:14</a></B> Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, came <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> the Spirit of the LORD in the midst of the congregation; <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) Who was moved by the Spirit of God to prophecy. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ch20_14"</a><B><a href="/2-chronicles/20-15.html">20:15</a></B> And he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat, Thus saith the LORD unto you, Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> battle [is] not yours, but Gods. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) They fight against God and not against you, therefore he will fight for you. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ch20_15"</a><a name="2Ch20_16"</a><a name="2Ch20_17"</a><B><a href="/2-chronicles/20-18.html">20:18</a></B> And Jehoshaphat <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> bowed his head with [his] face to the ground: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the LORD, worshipping the LORD. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>l</span>) Declaring his faith and obedience to the word of the Lord, and giving thanks for the deliverance promised. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ch20_18"</a><a name="2Ch20_19"</a><B><a href="/2-chronicles/20-20.html">20:20</a></B> And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; Believe in the LORD your God, so shall ye be established; believe his <SUP><span>m</span></SUP> prophets, so shall ye prosper. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>m</span>) Give credit to their words and doctrine. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ch20_20"</a><B><a href="/2-chronicles/20-21.html">20:21</a></B> And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers unto the LORD, and that should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army, and to say, <SUP><span>n</span></SUP> Praise the LORD; for his mercy [endureth] for ever. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>n</span>) This was a psalm of thanksgiving which they used commonly to sing when they praised the Lord for his benefits, and was made by David, ( <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Psalms+136:1-26">Psalms 136:1-26</a> ). </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ch20_21"</a><B><a href="/2-chronicles/20-22.html">20:22</a></B> And when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and <SUP><span>o</span></SUP> mount Seir, which were come against Judah;
