as streams of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> a weary land. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) Where men are weary with travelling for lack of water. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa32_3"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/32-3.html">32:3</a></B> And the eyes of <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> them that see shall not be dim, and the ears of them that hear shall hearken. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>d</span>) He promises to give the true light which is the pure doctrine of Gods word, and understanding, and zeal of the same, are contrary to the threatenings against the wicked, ( <a href="/isaiah/6-9.html">Isaiah 6:9</a>  <a href="/isaiah/29-10.html">Isaiah 29:10</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa32_4"></a><a name="Isa32_5"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/32-5.html">32:5</a></B> The <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> vile person shall be no more called noble, nor the churl said [to be] bountiful. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) Vice will no more be called virtue, nor virtue esteemed by power and riches. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa32_6"></a><a name="Isa32_7"></a><a name="Isa32_8"></a><a name="Isa32_9"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/32-9.html">32:9</a></B> Rise up, ye women that are at ease; hear my voice, ye <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> careless daughters; give ear to my speech. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) He prophecies of such calamity to come that they will not spare the women and children, and therefore wills them to take heed and provide. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa32_10"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/32-10.html">32:10</a></B> Many days and years shall ye be troubled, <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> ye careless women: <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> for the vintage shall fail, the gathering shall not come. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) Meaning that the affliction would continue long and when one year was past, yet they should look for new plagues. <BR>(<span>h</span>) God will take from you the means and opportunities, which made you contemn him: that is, abundance of worldly goods. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa32_11"></a><a name="Isa32_12"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/32-12.html">32:12</a></B> They shall lament for the <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> breasts, for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) By the breasts he means the plentiful fields, by which men are nourished as children with the breast: or, the mothers for sorrow and heaviness will lack milk. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa32_13"></a><a name="Isa32_14"></a><a name="Isa32_15"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/32-15.html">32:15</a></B> Until the <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> spirit shall be poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness shall be a fruitful field, and the <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> fruitful field shall be counted for a forest. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) That is, when the Church will be restored, thus the prophets after they have denounced Gods judgments against the wicked, used to comfort the godly, lest they should faint. <BR>(<span>l</span>) The field which is now fruitful, will be but as a barren forest in comparison to what it will be then as in ( <a href="/isaiah/29-17.html">Isaiah 29:17</a> ) which will be fulfilled in Christs time, for then they who were before as the barren wilderness, being regenerate will be fruitful and they who had some beginning of godliness, will bring forth fruit in such abundance, that their former life will seem but as a wilderness where no fruit was. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa32_16"></a><a name="Isa32_17"></a><a name="Isa32_18"></a><a name="Isa32_19"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/32-19.html">32:19</a></B> When it shall hail, coming down on the forest;
