And David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>a</span>) Because Nahash received David and his company, when Saul persecuted him he would now show pleasure to his son for the same. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ch19_2"</a><B><a href="/1-chronicles/19-3.html">19:3</a></B> But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto thee for to search, and to overthrow, and to <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> spy out the land? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>b</span>) Thus the malicious always interpret the purpose of the godly in the worst sense. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ch19_3"</a><B><a href="/1-chronicles/19-4.html">19:4</a></B> Wherefore Hanun took Davids servants, and <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> shaved them, and cut off their <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> garments in the midst hard by their buttocks, and sent them away. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) They shaved off half of their beards, ( <a href="/2-samuel/10-4.html">2&nbsp;Samuel 10:4</a> ). <BR>(<span>d</span>) To put them to shame and villany, while the ambassadors should have been honoured: and because the Jews used to wear side garments and beards, they thus disfigured them, to make them odious to others. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ch19_4"</a><a name="1Ch19_5"</a><B><a href="/1-chronicles/19-6.html">19:6</a></B> And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syriamaachah, and out of <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> Zobah. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) Which were five in all. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ch19_6"</a><B><a href="/1-chronicles/19-7.html">19:7</a></B> So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah and his people; who came and pitched before <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> Medeba.
