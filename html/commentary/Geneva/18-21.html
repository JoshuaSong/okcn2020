and if [it <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> were so], why should not my spirit be troubled? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>b</span>) As though he would say, I do not talk with man but with God, who will not answer me, and therefore my mind must be troubled. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Job21_5"></a><B><a href="/job/21-5.html">21:5</a></B> Mark me, and be astonished, and lay [your] hand upon [your] <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> mouth. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) He charges them as though they were not able to comprehend his feeling of Gods judgment, and exhorts them therefore to silence. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Job21_6"></a><a name="Job21_7"></a><B><a href="/job/21-7.html">21:7</a></B> Wherefore do the wicked <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> live, become old, yea, are mighty in power? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) Job proves against his adversaries that God does not punish the wicked immediately, but often gives them long life and prosperity, so we must not judge God just or unjust by the things that appear to our eyes. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Job21_8"></a><a name="Job21_9"></a><a name="Job21_10"></a><a name="Job21_11"></a><B><a href="/job/21-11.html">21:11</a></B> They send forth their little ones <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> like a flock, and their children dance. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) They have healthy children and in those points he answers to that which Zophar alleged before. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Job21_12"></a><a name="Job21_13"></a><B><a href="/job/21-13.html">21:13</a></B> They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> go down to the grave. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) Not being tormented with long sickness. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Job21_14"></a><B><a href="/job/21-14.html">21:14</a></B> Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> knowledge of thy ways. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) They desire nothing more than to be exempt from all subjection that they should bear to God, thus Job shows his adversaries, that if they reason only by that which is seen by common experience the wicked who hate God are better dealt withal than they who love him. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Job21_15"></a><a name="Job21_16"></a><B><a href="/job/21-16.html">21:16</a></B> Lo, their good [is] not in their <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> hand: the counsel of the wicked <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> is far from me. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) It is not their own, but God only lends it to them. <BR>(<span>i</span>) God keep me from their prosperity. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Job21_17"></a><a name="Job21_18"></a><a name="Job21_19"></a><a name="Job21_20"></a><B><a href="/job/21-20.html">21:20</a></B> <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) When God recompenses his wickedness, he will know that his prosperity was vanity. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Job21_21"></a><a name="Job21_22"></a><B><a href="/job/21-22.html">21:22</a></B> Shall [any] teach <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> God knowledge?
