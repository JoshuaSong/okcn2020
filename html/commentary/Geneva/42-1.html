<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>b</span>) Luke was not any eye witness, and therefore it was not he to whom the Lord appeared when Cleopas saw him: and he was taught not only by Paul, but by others of the apostles also. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu1_3"></a><B><a href="/luke/1-3.html">1:3</a></B> It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> from the very first, to write unto thee in order, <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> most excellent Theophilus, <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) Luke began his gospel a great deal further in the past than the others did. <BR>(<span>d</span>) It is "most mighty", and therefore Theophilus was a very honourable man, and in a place of great dignity. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu1_4"></a><B><a href="/luke/1-4.html">1:4</a></B> That thou mightest <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) Have fuller knowledge of those things which you know only partially. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu1_5"></a><B><a href="/luke/1-5.html">1:5</a></B> There <SUP><span>2</span></SUP> was <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> in the days of <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> course of Abia: and his wife [was] of the daughters of Aaron, and her name [was] Elisabeth. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>2</span>) John, who was another Elias and appointed to be the herald of Christ, coming from the family of Aaron, and of two famous and blameless parents, has shown in his conception (which was against the course of nature) a double miracle, to the end that men should be more readily prepared for the hearing of his preaching, according to the forewarning of the prophets. <BR>(<span>f</span>) This is a Hebrew idiom which shows us how short and frail a thing the power of princes is. <BR>(<span>g</span>) Herod the great. <BR>(<span>h</span>) For the posterity of Aaron was divided into courses. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu1_6"></a><B><a href="/luke/1-6.html">1:6</a></B> And they were both <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> righteous before God, <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> walking in all the <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> commandments and ordinances of the Lord <SUP><span>m</span></SUP> blameless. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) The true mark of righteousness is demonstrated when one is liked and accepted in the judgment of God. <BR>(<span>k</span>) Lived, as the Hebrews say, for our life is as a way in which we must walk until we come to the mark. <BR>(<span>l</span>) In all the moral and ceremonial law. <BR>(<span>m</span>) Whom no man could justly reprove: now so it is that the fruits of justification are set forth here, and not the cause, which is faith only, and nothing else. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu1_7"></a><a name="Lu1_8"></a><a name="Lu1_9"></a><B><a href="/luke/1-9.html">1:9</a></B> According to the custom of the priests office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the <SUP><span>n</span></SUP> temple of the Lord. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>n</span>) The temple was one, and the court another, for Zacharias went out of the court (or outward room) where all the people were (and therefore they are said to be without) and into the temple. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu1_10"></a><a name="Lu1_11"></a><a name="Lu1_12"></a><a name="Lu1_13"></a><a name="Lu1_14"></a><a name="Lu1_15"></a><B><a href="/luke/1-15.html">1:15</a></B> For he shall be great in the <SUP><span>o</span></SUP> sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor <SUP><span>p</span></SUP> strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mothers womb. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>o</span>) So the Hebrews say when a rare kind of excellency is signified: so it is said of Nimrod in ( <a href="/genesis/10-9.html">Genesis 10:9</a> ), "He was a mighty hunter before the LORD". <BR>(<span>p</span>) Any drink that might make someone drunk. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu1_16"></a><B><a href="/luke/1-16.html">1:16</a></B> And many of the children of Israel shall he <SUP><span>q</span></SUP> turn to the Lord their God. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>q</span>) Shall be a means to bring many to repentance, and they will turn themselves to the Lord, from whom they fell. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu1_17"></a><B><a href="/luke/1-17.html">1:17</a></B> And he shall go <SUP><span>r</span></SUP> before him <SUP><span>s</span></SUP> in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the <SUP><span>t</span></SUP> hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the <SUP><span>u</span></SUP> wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>r</span>) As they used to go before kings, and when you see them, you know the king is not far off. <BR>(<span>s</span>) This is spoken by the figure of speech metonymy, taking the spirit for the gift of the spirit; as you would say, the cause of that which comes from the cause. <BR>(<span>t</span>) By the figure of speech synecdoche he shows that he will take away all types of enmities which used to breed great troubles and turmoils among men. <BR>(<span>u</span>) Wisdom and goodness are two of the main causes which make men revere and honour their fathers. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu1_18"></a><a name="Lu1_19"></a><B><a href="/luke/1-19.html">1:19</a></B> And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, <SUP><span>x</span></SUP> that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>x</span>) That appears, for so the Hebrews use this saying "to stand" to mean that they are ready to do his commandment. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu1_20"></a><a name="Lu1_21"></a><a name="Lu1_22"></a><a name="Lu1_23"></a><a name="Lu1_24"></a><a name="Lu1_25"></a><a name="Lu1_26"></a><B><a href="/luke/1-26.html">1:26</a></B> <SUP><span>3</span></SUP> And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth, <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>3</span>) The angel, serving the Lord who would be born, is sent to the virgin Mary, in whom the son of the most high promised to David is conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu1_27"></a><B><a href="/luke/1-27.html">1:27</a></B> To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the <SUP><span>y</span></SUP> house of David;

<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>4</span>) Elisabeth being many months pregnant with John, and Mary being pregnant with Christ, do rejoice for each other by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. <BR>(<span>m</span>) Which is on the south side of Jerusalem. <BR>(<span>n</span>) That is to say, Hebron: which was in times past called Kirjatharba: which was one of the towns that were given to the Levites in the tribe of Judah, and is said to be in the mountains of Judah; ( <a href="/joshua/14-15.html">Joshua 14:15</a> ;  <a href="/joshua/21-11.html">21:11</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu1_40"></a><a name="Lu1_41"></a><B><a href="/luke/1-41.html">1:41</a></B> And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe <SUP><span>o</span></SUP> leaped in her womb;
