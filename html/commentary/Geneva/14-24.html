This Zachariah is also called the son of Barachias, ( <a href="/matthew/23-35.html">Matthew 23:35</a> ) because his progenitors were Iddo, Berachiah, Jehoiada. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ch24_22"</a><a name="2Ch24_23"</a><B><a href="/2-chronicles/24-24.html">24:24</a></B> For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men, and the LORD delivered a very great host into their hand, because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers.
