		<span><B><a href="/genesis/3.html">Chapter 3</a></B></span><P><span><a name="Ge3_1"></a><B><a href="/genesis/3-1.html">3:1</a></B> Now the serpent was more <SUP><span>a</span></SUP> subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>a</span>) As Satan can change himself into an angel of light, so did he abuse the wisdom of the serpent to deceive man. <BR>(<span>b</span>) God allowed Satan to make the serpent his instrument and to speak through him. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge3_2"></a><a name="Ge3_3"></a><B><a href="/genesis/3-3.html">3:3</a></B> But of the fruit of the tree which [is] in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> lest ye die. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) In doubting Gods warnings she yielded to Satan. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge3_4"></a><B><a href="/genesis/3-4.html">3:4</a></B> And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> die: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) This is Satans chiefest subtilty, to cause us not to fear Gods warnings. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge3_5"></a><B><a href="/genesis/3-5.html">3:5</a></B> For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> knowing good and evil. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) As though he said, God forbids you to eat of the fruit, only because he knows that if you eat of it, you will be like him. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge3_6"></a><B><a href="/genesis/3-6.html">3:6</a></B> And when the woman saw that the tree [was] good for food, and that it [was] pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make [one] wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> did eat. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) Not so much to please his wife, as moved by ambition at her persuasion. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge3_7"></a><B><a href="/genesis/3-7.html">3:7</a></B> And the eyes of them both were opened, and they <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> knew that they [were] naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) They began to feel their misery, but they did not seek God for a remedy. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge3_8"></a><B><a href="/genesis/3-8.html">3:8</a></B> And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) The sinful conscience flees Gods presence. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge3_9"></a><a name="Ge3_10"></a><B><a href="/genesis/3-10.html">3:10</a></B> And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I [was] <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> naked; and I hid myself. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) His hypocrisy appears in that he hid the cause of his nakedness, which was the transgression of Gods commandment. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge3_11"></a><a name="Ge3_12"></a><B><a href="/genesis/3-12.html">3:12</a></B> And the man said, The woman whom thou <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> gavest [to be] with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) His wickedness and lack of true repentance appears in this that he blamed God because he had given him a wife. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge3_13"></a><B><a href="/genesis/3-13.html">3:13</a></B> And the LORD God said unto the woman, What [is] this [that] thou hast done? And the woman said, <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>l</span>) Instead of confessing her sin, she increases it by accusing the serpent. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge3_14"></a><B><a href="/genesis/3-14.html">3:14</a></B> And the LORD God said unto the serpent, <SUP><span>m</span></SUP> Because thou hast done this, thou [art] cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and <SUP><span>n</span></SUP> dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>m</span>) He asked the reason from Adam and his wife, because he would bring them to repentance, but he does not ask the serpent, because he would show him no mercy. <BR>(<span>n</span>) As a vile and contemptible beast, ( <a href="/isaiah/65-25.html">Isaiah 65:25</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge3_15"></a><B><a href="/genesis/3-15.html">3:15</a></B> And I will put enmity between <SUP><span>o</span></SUP> thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy <SUP><span>p</span></SUP> head, and thou shalt <SUP><span>q</span></SUP> bruise his heel. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>o</span>) He chiefly means Satan, by whose action and deceit the serpent deceived the woman. <BR>(<span>p</span>) That is, the power of sin and death. <BR>(<span>q</span>) Satan shall sting Christ and his members, but not overcome them. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge3_16"></a><B><a href="/genesis/3-16.html">3:16</a></B> Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy <SUP><span>r</span></SUP> sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire [shall be] to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>r</span>) The Lord comforts Adam by the promise of the blessed seed, and also punishes the body for the sin which the soul should have been punished for; that the spirit having conceived hope of forgiveness might live by faith. ( <a href="/1-corinthians/14-34.html">1&nbsp;Corinthians 14:34</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge3_17"></a><B><a href="/genesis/3-17.html">3:17</a></B> And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: <SUP><span>s</span></SUP> cursed [is] the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat [of] it all the days of thy life; <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>s</span>) The transgression of Gods commandment was the reason that both mankind and all other creatures were subject to the curse. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge3_18"></a><B><a href="/genesis/3-18.html">3:18</a></B> <SUP><span>t</span></SUP> Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field; <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>t</span>) These are not the natural fruit of the earth, but proceed from the corruption of sin. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge3_19"></a><a name="Ge3_20"></a><a name="Ge3_21"></a><B><a href="/genesis/3-21.html">3:21</a></B> Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God <SUP><span>u</span></SUP> make coats of skins, and clothed them. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>u</span>) Or, gave them knowledge to make themselves coats. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge3_22"></a><B><a href="/genesis/3-22.html">3:22</a></B> And the LORD God said, <SUP><span>x</span></SUP> Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and <SUP><span>y</span></SUP> take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>x</span>) By this derision by reproaches Adams misery, into which he was fallen by ambition. <BR>(<span>y</span>) Adam deprived of life, lost also the sign of it. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
