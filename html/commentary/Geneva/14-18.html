And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people that [he had] with him, and persuaded him to go up [with him] to <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> Ramothgilead. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>b</span>) That is, the third year, ( <a href="/1-kings/22-2.html">1&nbsp;Kings 22:2</a> ). <BR>(<span>c</span>) To recover it out of the hands of the Syrians. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ch18_2"</a><a name="2Ch18_3"</a><B><a href="/2-chronicles/18-4.html">18:4</a></B> And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> word of the LORD to day. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) Hear the advise of some prophet to know whether it is Gods will. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ch18_4"</a><B><a href="/2-chronicles/18-5.html">18:5</a></B> Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> prophets four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver [it] into the kings hand. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) Who were the prophets of Baal, signifying that the wicked esteem none but liars and such as will bear with their inordinate affections. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ch18_5"</a><a name="2Ch18_6"</a><B><a href="/2-chronicles/18-7.html">18:7</a></B> And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, [There is] yet one man, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> hate him; for he never prophesied good unto me, but always evil: the same [is] Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> so. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) Yet the true ministers of God should not cease to do their duty, even though the wicked magistrates cannot abide them speaking the truth. <BR>(<span>g</span>) Meaning, that he should not refuse to hear any that was from God. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ch18_7"</a><a name="2Ch18_8"</a><B><a href="/2-chronicles/18-9.html">18:9</a></B> And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat either of them on his throne, clothed in [their] <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> robes, and they sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) That is, in their majesty and royal apparel. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ch18_9"</a><B><a href="/2-chronicles/18-10.html">18:10</a></B> And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> horns of iron, and said, Thus saith the LORD, With these thou shalt push Syria until they be consumed. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) Read ( <a href="/1-kings/22-11.html">1&nbsp;Kings 22:11</a> ). </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ch18_10"</a><a name="2Ch18_11"</a><B><a href="/2-chronicles/18-12.html">18:12</a></B> And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets [declare] good to the king with one <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> assent; let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of theirs, and speak thou good. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) Thinking, that since four hundred prophets had agreed in one thing, that he being but one man and in least estimation, did not dare to go against it. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ch18_12"</a><a name="2Ch18_13"</a><B><a href="/2-chronicles/18-14.html">18:14</a></B> And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear?

And <SUP><span>o</span></SUP> [the LORD] said, Thou shalt entice [him], and thou shalt also prevail: go out, and do [even] so. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>o</span>) That is, the Lord. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ch18_21"</a><B><a href="/2-chronicles/18-22.html">18:22</a></B> Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a <SUP><span>p</span></SUP> lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil against thee. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>p</span>) To those who would not believe the truth, God sent a strong delusion, that they would believe lies, ( <a href="/2-thessalonians/2-10.html">2&nbsp;Thessalonians 2:10</a> ). </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ch18_22"</a><B><a href="/2-chronicles/18-23.html">18:23</a></B> Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah upon the <SUP><span>q</span></SUP> cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>q</span>) By this cruelty his ambition and hypocrisy was discovered; thus the hypocrites boast of the Spirit which they do not have, and declare their malice against them on whom the true Spirit is. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ch18_23"</a><a name="2Ch18_24"</a><a name="2Ch18_25"</a><B><a href="/2-chronicles/18-26.html">18:26</a></B> And say, Thus saith the king, Put this [fellow] in the prison, and feed him with bread of <SUP><span>r</span></SUP> affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>r</span>) Keep him in prison, and let him feel hunger and thirst. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ch18_26"</a><a name="2Ch18_27"</a><a name="2Ch18_28"</a><B><a href="/2-chronicles/18-29.html">18:29</a></B> And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will <SUP><span>s</span></SUP> disguise myself, and will go to the battle; but put thou on thy robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went to the battle. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>s</span>) Thus the wicked think by their own subtilty to escape Gods judgments which he threatens by his word. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ch18_29"</a><a name="2Ch18_30"</a><B><a href="/2-chronicles/18-31.html">18:31</a></B> And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It [is] the king of Israel.
