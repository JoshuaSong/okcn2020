Declaring that flourishing kingdoms, unless they are preserved by Gods protection, (who then favours them when his word is truly set forth, virtue esteemed, vice punished, and concord maintained) fall to decay and come to nothing as appears by the dividing of the kingdom under Rehoboam and Jeroboam, who were one people before and now by the just punishment of God were made two. Judah and Benjamin were under Rehoboam, and this was called the kingdom of Judah. The other ten tribes held with Jeroboam, and this was called the kingdom of Israel. The king of Judah had his throne in Jerusalem, and the king of Israel in Samaria, after it was built by Omri Ahabs father. Because our Saviour Christ according to the flesh, comes from the stock of David, the genealogy of the kings of Judah is here described, from Solomon to Joram the son of Jehoshaphat, who reigned over Judah in Jerusalem as Ahab did over Israel in Samaria. <BR>(<span>a</span>) He was about 70 years old, ( <a href="/2-samuel/5-4.html">2&nbsp;Samuel 5:4</a> ). <BR>(<span>b</span>) For his natural heat was worn away with travels. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki1_1"</a><a name="1Ki1_2"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/1-3.html">1:3</a></B> So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel, and found Abishag <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> a Shunammite, and brought her to the king. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) A city in the tribe of Issachar, ( <a href="/joshua/19-18.html">Joshua 19:18</a> ). </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki1_3"</a><a name="1Ki1_4"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/1-5.html">1:5</a></B> Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> fifty men to run before him. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) Read ( <a href="/2-samuel/15-1.html">2&nbsp;Samuel 15:1</a> ). </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki1_5"</a><a name="1Ki1_6"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/1-7.html">1:7</a></B> And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> helped [him]. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) They took his part and followed him. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki1_7"</a><a name="1Ki1_8"</a><a name="1Ki1_9"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/1-10.html">1:10</a></B> But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) As the Cherethites and Pelethites. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki1_10"</a><a name="1Ki1_11"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/1-12.html">1:12</a></B> Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> life, and the life of thy son Solomon. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) For Adonijah will destroy you and your son, if he reigns. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki1_12"</a><a name="1Ki1_13"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/1-14.html">1:14</a></B> Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also will come in after thee, and <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> confirm thy words. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) By declaring such things, as may further the same. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki1_14"</a><a name="1Ki1_15"</a><a name="1Ki1_16"</a><a name="1Ki1_17"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/1-18.html">1:18</a></B> And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king, thou knowest <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> [it] not: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) The king being worn with age, could not attend to the affairs of the realm, and also Adonijah had many who kept it from the king. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki1_18"</a><a name="1Ki1_19"</a><a name="1Ki1_20"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/1-21.html">1:21</a></B> Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> counted offenders. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) And so put to death as wicked transgressors. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki1_21"</a><a name="1Ki1_22"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/1-23.html">1:23</a></B> And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet.
