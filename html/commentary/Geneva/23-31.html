		<span><B><a href="/isaiah/31.html">Chapter 31</a></B></span><P><span><a name="Isa31_1"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/31-1.html">31:1</a></B> Woe to them that <SUP><span>a</span></SUP> go down to Egypt for help; and rely on horses, and trust in chariots, because [they are] many; and in horsemen, because they are very strong; but they look not to the Holy One of Israel, neither <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> seek the LORD! <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>a</span>) There were two special reasons why the Israelites should not join with the Egyptians: first, because the Lord had commanded them never to return there, ( <a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.html">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>  <a href="/deuteronomy/28-68.html">Deuteronomy 28:68</a> ) lest they should forget the benefit of their redemption: and secondly, lest they should be corrupted with the superstition and idolatry of the Egyptians, and so forsake God, ( <a href="/jeremiah/2-18.html">Jeremiah 2:18</a> ). <BR>(<span>b</span>) Meaning, that they forsake the Lord, if they put their trust in worldly things: for they cannot trust in both. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa31_2"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/31-2.html">31:2</a></B> Yet he also [is] <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> wise, and will bring evil, and will not call back his words: but will arise against the house of the evildoers, and against the help of them that work iniquity. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) And knows their crafty enterprises, and will bring all to nought. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa31_3"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/31-3.html">31:3</a></B> Now the Egyptians [are] men, and not God; and their horses flesh, and not spirit. When the LORD shall stretch out his hand, both he that <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> helpeth shall fall, and he that is helped shall fall down, and they all shall fail together. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) Meaning, both the Egyptians and the Israelites. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa31_4"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/31-4.html">31:4</a></B> For thus hath the LORD spoken to me, As the lion and the young lion roaring on his prey, when a multitude of shepherds is called forth against him, [he] will not be afraid of their voice, nor abase himself for the noise of them: so shall the LORD of hosts come <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> down to fight for mount Zion, and for its hill. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>e</span>) He shows the Jews that if they would put their trust in him, he is so able, that no one can resist his power and so care over them, as a bird over her young, which ever flies about them for their defence: which similitude the scripture uses in various places, as in ( <a href="/deuteronomy/32-11.html">Deuteronomy 32:11</a> ;  <a href="/matthew/23-37.html">Matthew 23:37</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa31_5"></a><a name="Isa31_6"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/31-6.html">31:6</a></B> Turn ye to [him from] whom the children of Israel have <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> deeply revolted. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) He touches their conscience that they might earnestly feel their grievous sins, and so truly repent, for as much as now they are almost drowned and past recovery. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa31_7"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/31-7.html">31:7</a></B> For in that day every man shall <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> cast away his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which your own hands have made to you [for] a sin. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>g</span>) By these fruits your repentance will be known, as in ( <a href="/isaiah/2-20.html">Isaiah 2:20</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa31_8"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/31-8.html">31:8</a></B> <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> Then shall the Assyrian fall with the sword, not of man; and the sword, not of men, shall devour him: but he shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall be made vessels. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) When your repentance appears. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa31_9"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/31-9.html">31:9</a></B> And he shall pass over to his <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> strong hold for fear, and his princes shall be afraid of the ensign, saith the LORD, whose <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> fire [is] in Zion, and his furnace in Jerusalem. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) This was accomplished soon after when Sennacheribs army was discomfited, and he fled to his castle in Nineveh for comfort. <BR>(<span>k</span>) To destroy his enemies. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
