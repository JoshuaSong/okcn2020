And she said unto him, The Philistines [be] upon thee, Samson. And he brake the withs, as a thread of tow is broken when <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> it toucheth the fire. So his strength was not known. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) Certain Philistines in a secret chamber. <BR>(<span>e</span>) When fire comes near it. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jud16_10"></a><B><a href="/judges/16-10.html">16:10</a></B> And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: now <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) Though her deceit threatened his life, yet his affection so blinded him, that he could not beware. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jud16_11"></a><a name="Jud16_12"></a><a name="Jud16_13"></a><B><a href="/judges/16-13.html">16:13</a></B> And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> And he said unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) It is impossible if we give place to our wicked affections, for eventually we will be destroyed. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jud16_14"></a><a name="Jud16_15"></a><B><a href="/judges/16-15.html">16:15</a></B> And she said unto him, How canst thou say, <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> I love thee, when thine heart [is] not with me? thou hast mocked me these three times, and hast not told me wherein thy great strength [lieth]. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) For Samson used to say "I love you". <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jud16_16"></a><a name="Jud16_17"></a><B><a href="/judges/16-17.html">16:17</a></B> That he told her all his <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> heart, and said unto her, There hath not come a razor upon mine head; for I [have been] a Nazarite unto God from my mothers womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any [other] man. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) Thus his immoderate affections toward a wicked woman caused him to lose Gods excellent gifts, and become a slave to those whom he should have ruled. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jud16_18"></a><a name="Jud16_19"></a><B><a href="/judges/16-19.html">16:19</a></B> And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> from him. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) Not for the loss of his hair, but for the contempt of the ordinance of God, which was the reason God departed from him. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jud16_20"></a><a name="Jud16_21"></a><a name="Jud16_22"></a><B><a href="/judges/16-22.html">16:22</a></B> Howbeit the hair of his head began to <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> grow again after he was shaven. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>l</span>) Yet he did not regain his strength, till he had called on God and reconciled himself. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jud16_23"></a><a name="Jud16_24"></a><a name="Jud16_25"></a><B><a href="/judges/16-25.html">16:25</a></B> And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport.
