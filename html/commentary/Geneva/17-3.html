But Mordecai <SUP><span>a</span></SUP> bowed not, nor did [him] reverence. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>a</span>) The Persians custom was to kneel down and reverence their kings, and such as he anointed in chief authority, which Mordecai would not do to this ambitious and proud man. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Es3_3"></a><a name="Es3_4"></a><B><a href="/esther/3-4.html">3:4</a></B> Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them, that they <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> told Haman, to see whether Mordecais matters would stand: for he had told them that he [was] a Jew. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>b</span>) Thus we see that there is no one so wicked but they have their flatterers to accuse the godly. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Es3_5"></a><a name="Es3_6"></a><a name="Es3_7"></a><B><a href="/esther/3-7.html">3:7</a></B> In the first month, that [is], the month <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that [is], the lot, <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, [to] the twelfth [month], that [is], the month <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> Adar. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) Which contains part of March and part of April. <BR>(<span>d</span>) To know what month and day would be good to attempt this thing, that it might be successful: but God disappointed their lots and expectations. <BR>(<span>e</span>) Containing part of February and part of March. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Es3_8"></a><B><a href="/esther/3-8.html">3:8</a></B> And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws [are] diverse from all people; neither keep they the <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> kings laws: therefore it [is] not for the kings profit to suffer them. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) These are the two arguments which commonly the worldlings and the wicked use toward princes against the godly, that is, the contempt of their laws and diminishing of their profit without concern as to whether God is pleased or displeased. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Es3_9"></a><a name="Es3_10"></a><a name="Es3_11"></a><a name="Es3_12"></a><a name="Es3_13"></a><a name="Es3_14"></a><a name="Es3_15"></a><B><a href="/esther/3-15.html">3:15</a></B> The posts went out, being hastened by the kings commandment, and the decree was given in Shushan the palace.
