		<span><B><a href="/1-thessalonians/2.html">Chapter 2</a></B></span><P><span> <B><a href="/1-thessalonians/2-1.html">2:1</a></B> For <SUP><span>1</span></SUP> yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>1</span>) That which he mentioned before briefly concerning his apostleship, he handles now more at large, and to that end and purpose which we spoke of. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Th2_1"</a><B><a href="/1-thessalonians/2-2.html">2:2</a></B> <SUP><span>2</span></SUP> But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in <SUP><span>a</span></SUP> our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>2</span>) The virtues of a true pastor are freely without fear to preach the Gospel, even in the midst of dangers. <BR>(<span>a</span>) Through Gods gracious help. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Th2_2"</a><B><a href="/1-thessalonians/2-3.html">2:3</a></B> <SUP><span>3</span></SUP> For our exhortation [was] not of deceit, nor of <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> uncleanness, nor in guile: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>3</span>) To teach pure doctrine faithfully and with a pure heart. <BR>(<span>b</span>) By any wicked and evil type of dealing. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Th2_3"</a><B><a href="/1-thessalonians/2-4.html">2:4</a></B> <SUP><span>4</span></SUP> But as we were <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> trieth our hearts. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>4</span>) To approve his conscience to God, being free from all flattery and covetousness. <BR>(<span>c</span>) There is this difference between the judgments of God and the judgments of men, that when men choose, they give regard to the qualities of those things which stand before them, but God finds the reason of his counsel only in himself. Therefore, it follows that seeing as we are not able to think a good thought, that whoever he first chooses to those callings, he does not find them able but indeed makes them able. And therefore in that we are empowered of God, it depends upon his mercy. <BR>(<span>d</span>) Who approves and allows them. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Th2_4"</a><a name="1Th2_5"</a><B><a href="/1-thessalonians/2-6.html">2:6</a></B> <SUP><span>5</span></SUP> Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor [yet] of others, when we might have been <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> burdensome, as the apostles of Christ. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>5</span>) To submit himself even to the basest, to win them, and to avoid all pride. <BR>(<span>e</span>) When I might lawfully have lived upon the expenses of the churches. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Th2_6"</a><B><a href="/1-thessalonians/2-7.html">2:7</a></B> But we were <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) We were rough, and yet easy and gentle as a nurse that is neither seeking glory, nor covetous, but who takes all pains as patiently as if she were a mother. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Th2_7"</a><B><a href="/1-thessalonians/2-8.html">2:8</a></B> <SUP><span>6</span></SUP> So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were dear unto us. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>6</span>) To consider the flock that is committed to him as more important than his own life. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Th2_8"</a><B><a href="/1-thessalonians/2-9.html">2:9</a></B> <SUP><span>7</span></SUP> For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>7</span>) To let go of his own rights, rather than to be a cost to his sheep. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Th2_9"</a><B><a href="/1-thessalonians/2-10.html">2:10</a></B> <SUP><span>8</span></SUP> Ye [are] witnesses, and God [also], how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>8</span>) To excel others in the example of a godly life. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Th2_10"</a><B><a href="/1-thessalonians/2-11.html">2:11</a></B> <SUP><span>9</span></SUP> As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father [doth] his children, <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>9</span>) To exhort and comfort with a fatherly mind and affection. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Th2_11"</a><B><a href="/1-thessalonians/2-12.html">2:12</a></B> <SUP><span>10</span></SUP> That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>10</span>) To exhort all men diligently and earnestly to lead a godly life. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Th2_12"</a><B><a href="/1-thessalonians/2-13.html">2:13</a></B> <SUP><span>11</span></SUP> For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received [it] not [as] the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>11</span>) Having approved his ministry, he commends again (to that end and purpose that I spoke of) the cheerfulness of the Thessalonians which was due to his diligence in preaching, and their brave patience. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Th2_13"</a><B><a href="/1-thessalonians/2-14.html">2:14</a></B> <SUP><span>12</span></SUP> For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your own <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> countrymen, even as they [have] of the Jews: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>12</span>) He strengthens and encourages them in their afflictions which they suffered among their own people, because they were afflicted by their own countrymen. And this happened, he says, to the churches of the Jews, as well as to them: and therefore they ought to take it in good part. <BR>(<span>g</span>) Which Christ has gathered together. <BR>(<span>h</span>) Even from those who are from the same country and the same town that you are from. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Th2_14"</a><B><a href="/1-thessalonians/2-15.html">2:15</a></B> <SUP><span>13</span></SUP> Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; <SUP><span>14</span></SUP> and they please not God, and are contrary to <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> all men: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>13</span>) He prevents an offence which might be taken, because the Jews especially above all others persecuted the Gospel. That is no new thing, he says, seeing that they slew Christ himself, and his Prophets, and have banished me also. <BR>(<span>14</span>) He foretells the utter destruction of the Jews, lest any man should be moved by their rebellion. <BR>(<span>i</span>) For the Jews would neither enter into the kingdom of God themselves, nor allow others to enter in. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Th2_15"</a><B><a href="/1-thessalonians/2-16.html">2:16</a></B> Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> fill up their sins alway: for the <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> wrath is come upon them to the uttermost. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) Until that wickedness of theirs which they have by inheritance as it were of their fathers, has grown so great, that the measure of their iniquity being filled, God may come forth to wrath. <BR>(<span>l</span>) The judgment of God who was angry, which indeed appeared shortly after in the destruction of the city of Jerusalem, where many fled even out of various provinces, when it was besieged. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Th2_16"</a><B><a href="/1-thessalonians/2-17.html">2:17</a></B> <SUP><span>15</span></SUP> But we, brethren, <SUP><span>m</span></SUP> being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>15</span>) He meets with an objection, why he did not come to them immediately, being in such great misery: I often desired to, he says, and I was not able, but Satan hindered my endeavours, and therefore I sent Timothy my faithful companion to you, because you are most dear to me. <BR>(<span>m</span>) Were kept apart from you, and as it were orphans. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
