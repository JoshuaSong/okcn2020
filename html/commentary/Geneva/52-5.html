But this is sure, that it will come upon men when they are not expecting it. <BR>(<span>a</span>) See ( <a href="/acts/1-7.html">Acts 1:7</a> ). </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Th5_1"</a><a name="1Th5_2"</a><a name="1Th5_3"</a><B><a href="/1-thessalonians/5-4.html">5:4</a></B> <SUP><span>2</span></SUP> But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>2</span>) Returning to exhortations, he warns us who are enlightened with the knowledge of God, that it is our duty not to live securely in pleasures, lest we be suddenly taken in a dead sleep in pleasures. But contrary to this we are to have an eye to the Lord, and not allow ourselves to be oppressed with the cares of this world, for pleasures are fitting for the darkness of the night, and having an eye to the Lord is fitting for the light. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Th5_4"</a><a name="1Th5_5"</a><a name="1Th5_6"</a><a name="1Th5_7"</a><B><a href="/1-thessalonians/5-8.html">5:8</a></B> <SUP><span>3</span></SUP> But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>3</span>) We must fight with faith and hope, and therefore we should certainly not lie snoring. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Th5_8"</a><B><a href="/1-thessalonians/5-9.html">5:9</a></B> <SUP><span>4</span></SUP> For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ, <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>4</span>) He urges us forward by setting a most certain hope of victory before us. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Th5_9"</a><B><a href="/1-thessalonians/5-10.html">5:10</a></B> <SUP><span>5</span></SUP> Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>5</span>) The death of Christ is a pledge of our victory, for he died so that we might be partakers of his life of power, indeed even while we live here. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Th5_10"</a><B><a href="/1-thessalonians/5-11.html">5:11</a></B> <SUP><span>6</span></SUP> Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>6</span>) We must not only watch ourselves, but we are also bound to stir up, and to strengthen and encourage one another. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Th5_11"</a><B><a href="/1-thessalonians/5-12.html">5:12</a></B> <SUP><span>7</span></SUP> And we beseech you, brethren, to <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> know them which labour among you, and are over you in the <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> Lord, and admonish you; <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>7</span>) We must have consideration of those who are appointed to the ministry of the word, and the government of the church of God, and who do their duty. <BR>(<span>b</span>) That you acknowledge and take them for such as they are, that is to say, men worthy to be greatly esteemed of among you. <BR>(<span>c</span>) In those things which pertain to Gods service: so is the ecclesiastical function distinguished from civil authority, and true shepherds from wolves. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Th5_12"</a><B><a href="/1-thessalonians/5-13.html">5:13</a></B> And to esteem them very highly in love for <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> their works sake. <SUP><span>8</span></SUP> [And] be at peace among yourselves. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) So then, when this reason ceases, then must the honour cease.
