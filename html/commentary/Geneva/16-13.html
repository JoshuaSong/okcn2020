Remember me, O my God, [concerning] this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) Meaning, of the temple that none that was unclean should enter. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ne13_23"></a><B><a href="/nehemiah/13-23.html">13:23</a></B> In those days also saw I Jews [that] had married wives of <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> Ashdod, of Ammon, [and] of Moab: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>l</span>) Which was a city of the Philistines and they had married wives from it and so had corrupted their speech and religion. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ne13_24"></a><a name="Ne13_25"></a><B><a href="/nehemiah/13-25.html">13:25</a></B> And I contended with them, and <SUP><span>m</span></SUP> cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, [saying], Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters unto your sons, or for yourselves. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>m</span>) That is, I excommunicated them and drove them out of the congregation. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ne13_26"></a><a name="Ne13_27"></a><a name="Ne13_28"></a><a name="Ne13_29"></a><B><a href="/nehemiah/13-29.html">13:29</a></B> Remember them, O my God, because they have <SUP><span>n</span></SUP> defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>n</span>) Punish them according to their sin and the evil example they have given to the rest of the people contrary to their calling. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ne13_30"></a><a name="Ne13_31"></a><B><a href="/nehemiah/13-31.html">13:31</a></B> And for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the firstfruits.
