<BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Am6_2"></a><B><a href="/amos/6-2.html">6:2</a></B> Pass ye unto Calneh, and see; and from thence go ye to Hamath the great: then go down to Gath of the Philistines: [be <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> they] better than these kingdoms? or their border greater than your border? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) If God has destroyed these excellent cities in three different kingdoms, that is Babylon, Syria, and that of the Philistines, and has narrowed their wide borders more than yours yet are, do you think that you are better, or that you will escape? <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Am6_3"></a><B><a href="/amos/6-3.html">6:3</a></B> Ye that put far away the <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> evil day, and cause the seat of violence to come near; <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) You that continue still in your wickedness, and think that Gods plagues are not at hand, but give yourselves to all idleness, lustfulness, and disorder. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Am6_4"></a><a name="Am6_5"></a><B><a href="/amos/6-5.html">6:5</a></B> That chant to the sound of the viol, [and] invent to themselves instruments of musick, like <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> David; <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) As he caused different types of instruments to be made to serve Gods glory, so these did strive to invent as many to serve their unrestrained affections and lusts. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Am6_6"></a><B><a href="/amos/6-6.html">6:6</a></B> That drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief ointments: but they are not <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> grieved for the affliction of Joseph. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) They did not pity their brethren, of which many were now slain and carried away captive. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Am6_7"></a><B><a href="/amos/6-7.html">6:7</a></B> Therefore now shall they go captive with the first that go captive, and the <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> banquet of them that stretched themselves shall be removed. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) Some read "the sorrow of them that stretched themselves is at hand". <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Am6_8"></a><B><a href="/amos/6-8.html">6:8</a></B> <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> The Lord GOD hath sworn by himself, saith the LORD the God of hosts, I abhor <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> the excellency of Jacob, and hate his palaces: therefore will I deliver up the city with all that is therein. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>h</span>) Read ( <a href="/jeremiah/51-14.html">Jeremiah 51:14</a> ). <BR>(<span>i</span>) That is, the riches and pomp. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Am6_9"></a><a name="Am6_10"></a><B><a href="/amos/6-10.html">6:10</a></B> And a mans uncle <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> shall take him up, and he that burneth him, to bring out the bones out of the house, and shall say unto him that [is] by the <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> sides of the house, [Is there] yet [any] with thee? and he shall say, No. Then shall he say, <SUP><span>m</span></SUP> Hold thy tongue: for we may not make mention of the name of the LORD. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) The destruction will be so great, that almost none will be left to bury the dead: and therefore they will burn them at home, to carry out the burnt ashes with more ease. <BR>(<span>l</span>) That is, to some neighbour that dwells near by. <BR>(<span>m</span>) They will be so astonished at this destruction, that they will not boast any more of the name of God, and that they are his people: but they will be silent when they hear Gods name, and abhor it, as those that are desperate, or reprobate. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Am6_11"></a><a name="Am6_12"></a><B><a href="/amos/6-12.html">6:12</a></B> Shall horses <SUP><span>n</span></SUP> run upon the rock? will [one] plow [there] with oxen? for ye have turned judgment into gall, and the fruit of righteousness into <SUP><span>o</span></SUP> hemlock: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>n</span>) He compares them to barren rocks, upon which it is in vain to bestow labour: showing that Gods benefits can have no place among them. <BR>(<span>o</span>) Read ( <a href="/amos/5-7.html">Amos 5:7</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Am6_13"></a><B><a href="/amos/6-13.html">6:13</a></B> Ye which rejoice in a thing of nought, which say, Have we not taken to us <SUP><span>p</span></SUP> horns by our own strength?
