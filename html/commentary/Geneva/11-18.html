(Now Obadiah <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> feared the LORD greatly: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>b</span>) God had begun to work his fear in his heart, but had not yet brought him to the knowledge which is also required of the godly: that is, to profess his Name openly. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki18_3"</a><a name="1Ki18_4"</a><a name="1Ki18_5"</a><a name="1Ki18_6"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/18-7.html">18:7</a></B> And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, [Art] thou that my lord Elijah? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) God often pities the wicked for the sake of the godly, and causes Elijah to meet with Obadiah, that the blessing might be known to be granted for the sake of Gods children. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki18_7"</a><a name="1Ki18_8"</a><a name="1Ki18_9"</a><a name="1Ki18_10"</a><a name="1Ki18_11"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/18-12.html">18:12</a></B> And it shall come to pass, [as soon as] I am gone from thee, that the Spirit of the LORD shall carry thee whither I know not; and [so] when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me: but I thy servant <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> fear the LORD from my youth. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) I am not of the wicked persecutors that you should procure to me such displeasure, but serve God and favour his children. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki18_12"</a><a name="1Ki18_13"</a><a name="1Ki18_14"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/18-15.html">18:15</a></B> And Elijah said, [As] the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I will surely shew <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> myself unto him to day. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) By my presence I will declare that you have told him the truth. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki18_15"</a><a name="1Ki18_16"</a><a name="1Ki18_17"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/18-18.html">18:18</a></B> And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> thou, and thy fathers house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the LORD, and thou hast followed Baalim. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) The true ministers of God should not only not permit falsehoods, but should boldly reprove the wicked slanderers without respect of persons. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki18_18"</a><a name="1Ki18_19"</a><a name="1Ki18_20"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/18-21.html">18:21</a></B> And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> halt ye between two opinions? if the LORD [be] God, follow him: but if Baal, [then] follow him. And the people answered him not a word. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) Be consistent in religion and do not be indifferent, whether you follow God or Baal, or whether you serve God wholly or in part, ( <a href="/zephaniah/1-5.html">Zephaniah 1:5</a> ). </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="1Ki18_21"</a><a name="1Ki18_22"</a><a name="1Ki18_23"</a><B><a href="/1-kings/18-24.html">18:24</a></B> And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the LORD: and the God that answereth <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> by fire, let him be God.
