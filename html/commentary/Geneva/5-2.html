and they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>c</span>) This was the second time, before they had caused the Israelites to return, ( <a href="/numbers/20-21.html">Numbers 20:21</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="De2_5"></a><a name="De2_6"></a><a name="De2_7"></a><B><a href="/deuteronomy/2-7.html">2:7</a></B> For the LORD thy God hath <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> blessed thee in all the works of thy hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the LORD thy God [hath been] with thee; thou hast lacked nothing. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) And given you means, with which you may make recompence: also God will direct you by his providence, as he has done. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="De2_8"></a><a name="De2_9"></a><B><a href="/deuteronomy/2-9.html">2:9</a></B> And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land [for] a possession;

until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the LORD sware unto them. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) He shows by this, that as God is true in his promise, so his threatenings are not in vain. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="De2_15"></a><B><a href="/deuteronomy/2-15.html">2:15</a></B> For indeed the <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from among the host, until they were consumed. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) His plague and punishment to destroy all that were twenty years old and above. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="De2_16"></a><a name="De2_17"></a><a name="De2_18"></a><a name="De2_19"></a><a name="De2_20"></a><B><a href="/deuteronomy/2-20.html">2:20</a></B> (That also was accounted a land <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> of giants: giants dwelt therein in old time;
