because the LORD hath anointed me to preach good tidings to the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> captives, and the opening of the prison to [them that are] bound; <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>a</span>) Thus belongs to all the prophets and ministers of God, but chiefly to Christ, of whose abundant graces everyone receives according as it pleases him to distribute. <BR>(<span>b</span>) To them that are lively touched with the feeling of their sins. <BR>(<span>c</span>) Who are in the bondage of sin. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa61_2"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/61-2.html">61:2</a></B> To proclaim the <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> acceptable year of the LORD, and the day of <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn; <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>d</span>) The time when it pleased God to show his good favour to man, which Paul calls the fulness of time, ( <a href="/galatians/4-4.html">Galatians 4:4</a> ). <BR>(<span>e</span>) For when God delivers his Church, he punishes his enemies. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa61_3"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/61-3.html">61:3</a></B> To appoint to them that mourn in Zion, to give to them beauty for <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they may be called <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he may be glorified. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) Which was the sign of mourning. <BR>(<span>g</span>) Trees that bring forth good fruits, as in ( <a href="/matthew/3-8.html">Matthew 3:8</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa61_4"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/61-4.html">61:4</a></B> And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> generations. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) That is, for a long time. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa61_5"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/61-5.html">61:5</a></B> And foreigners shall <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the alien [shall be] your plowmen and your vinedressers. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) They will be ready to serve you in all your needs. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa61_6"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/61-6.html">61:6</a></B> But ye shall be named the <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> Priests of the LORD: [men] shall call you the Ministers of our God: ye shall eat the <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> riches of the Gentiles, and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>k</span>) This is accomplished in the time of Christ, by whom all the faithful are made priests and kings, ( <a href="/1-peter/2-9.html">1&nbsp;Peter 2:9</a> ;
