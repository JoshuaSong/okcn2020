As for the shame of the cross, we have to set against that the decree and purpose of God for Christ, foretold by the Prophets, how that first of all he would be crucified here upon the earth, and then he would appear from heaven the judge and restorer of all things, that all believers might be saved, and all unbelievers utterly perish. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ac3_18"></a><B><a href="/acts/3-18.html">3:18</a></B> But those things, which God before had shewed <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) Though there were many Prophets, yet he speaks only of one mouth, to show us the consent and agreement of the Prophets. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ac3_19"></a><a name="Ac3_20"></a><a name="Ac3_21"></a><B><a href="/acts/3-21.html">3:21</a></B> <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) Or, be taken up into heaven. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ac3_22"></a><B><a href="/acts/3-22.html">3:22</a></B> For Moses truly said unto the fathers, <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) This promise referred to an excellent and singular Prophet. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ac3_23"></a><a name="Ac3_24"></a><B><a href="/acts/3-24.html">3:24</a></B> Yea, and all the prophets <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> from Samuel and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) At which time the kingdom of Israel was established. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ac3_25"></a><B><a href="/acts/3-25.html">3:25</a></B> <SUP><span>4</span></SUP> Ye are the <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>4</span>) The Jews that believed are the first begotten in the kingdom of God. <BR>(<span>i</span>) For whom the Prophets were especially appointed. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ac3_26"></a><B><a href="/acts/3-26.html">3:26</a></B> Unto you first God, having <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) Given to the world, or raised from the dead, and advanced to his kingdom. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
