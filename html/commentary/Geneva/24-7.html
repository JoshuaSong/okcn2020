Behold, even I have seen [it], saith the LORD. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>c</span>) As thieves hidden in holes and dens think themselves safe, so when you are in my temple, you think to be covered with the holiness of it, and that I cannot see your wickedness, ( <a href="/matthew/21-13.html">Matthew 21:13</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jer7_12"></a><B><a href="/jeremiah/7-12.html">7:12</a></B> But go ye now to my place which [was] in Shiloh, <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> where I set my name at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>d</span>) Because they depended so much on the temple, which was for his promise, that he would be present and defend them where the ark was, he sends them to Gods judgments against Shiloh, where the ark had remained about 300 years, and after was taken, the priests slain, and the people miserably discomfited, ( <a href="/1-samuel/4-11.html">1&nbsp;Samuel 4:11</a> ;

and I called you, but <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> ye answered not; <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>e</span>) That is, I never ceased to warn you, as in ( <a href="/isaiah/65-2.html">Isaiah 65:2</a> ;  <a href="default.aspx?reference=+1:23"> 1:23</a> ). <BR>(<span>f</span>) He shows the only remedy to redress our faults: to allow God to lead us in the way, and to obey his calling, ( <a href="/isaiah/66-4.html">Isaiah 66:4</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jer7_14"></a><a name="Jer7_15"></a><B><a href="/jeremiah/7-15.html">7:15</a></B> And I will cast <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your brethren, [even] the whole seed of Ephraim. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) I will send you into captivity as I have done Ephraim, that is, the ten tribes. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jer7_16"></a><B><a href="/jeremiah/7-16.html">7:16</a></B> Therefore <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither make intercession to me: for I will not hear thee. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>h</span>) To assure them that God had determined with himself to punish their wickedness, he shows the prayer of the godly cannot help them, while they remain in their obstinacy against God, and will not use the means that he uses to call them to repentance, ( <a href="/jeremiah/11-14.html">Jeremiah 11:14</a>  <a href="/jeremiah/14-11.html">Jeremiah 14:11</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jer7_17"></a><a name="Jer7_18"></a><B><a href="/jeremiah/7-18.html">7:18</a></B> The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead dough, to make cakes to <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings to other gods, that they may provoke me to anger. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>i</span>) That is, they sacrifice to the sun, moon and stars, which they called the queen of heaven, ( <a href="/jeremiah/44-17.html">Jeremiah 44:17</a> ;
