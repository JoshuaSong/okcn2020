Some take it that they should weep for joy. <BR>(<span>n</span>) Where they found no impediments, but abundance of all things. <BR>(<span>o</span>) That is, my dearly beloved as the first child is to the father. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jer31_10"></a><a name="Jer31_11"></a><B><a href="/jeremiah/31-11.html">31:11</a></B> For the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and ransomed him from the hand <SUP><span>p</span></SUP> of [him that was] stronger than he. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>p</span>) That is, from the Babylonians and other enemies. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jer31_12"></a><B><a href="/jeremiah/31-12.html">31:12</a></B> Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow together to the goodness of the LORD, for <SUP><span>q</span></SUP> grain, and for wine, and for oil, and for the young of the flock and of the herd: and their soul shall be as a watered garden; and they shall not sorrow any more at all. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>q</span>) By these temporal benefits he means the spiritual graces which are in the Church, and of which there would ever be plenty, ( <a href="/isaiah/58-11.html">Isaiah 58:11</a>  <a href="/isaiah/58-12.html">Isaiah 58:12</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jer31_13"></a><B><a href="/jeremiah/31-13.html">31:13</a></B> Then shall the virgin rejoice in the <SUP><span>r</span></SUP> dance, both young men and old together: for I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>r</span>) In the company of the faithful, who ever praise God for his benefits. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jer31_14"></a><B><a href="/jeremiah/31-14.html">31:14</a></B> And I will abundantly satisfy the soul of the priests with <SUP><span>s</span></SUP> fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, saith the LORD. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>s</span>) Meaning, the spirit of wisdom, knowledge and zeal. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jer31_15"></a><B><a href="/jeremiah/31-15.html">31:15</a></B> Thus saith the LORD; A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, [and] bitter weeping; <SUP><span>t</span></SUP> Rachel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children, because they [were] not. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>t</span>) To declare the greatness of Gods mercy in delivering the Jews, he shows them that they were like the Benjamites of the Israelites, that is, utterly destroyed and carried away, so much so that if Rachel the mother of Benjamin could have risen again to seek her children she would have found none remaining. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jer31_16"></a><a name="Jer31_17"></a><a name="Jer31_18"></a><B><a href="/jeremiah/31-18.html">31:18</a></B> I have surely heard <SUP><span>u</span></SUP> Ephraim bemoaning himself [thus]; Thou hast chastised me, and I was chastised, as a <SUP><span>x</span></SUP> bull unaccustomed [to the yoke]: <SUP><span>y</span></SUP> turn thou me, and I shall be turned; for thou [art] the LORD my God. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>u</span>) That is, the people who were led captive. <BR>(<span>x</span>) Which was wanton and could not be subject to the yoke. <BR>(<span>y</span>) He shows how the faithful used to pray, that is, desire God to tame them as they cannot turn of themselves. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jer31_19"></a><B><a href="/jeremiah/31-19.html">31:19</a></B> Surely after I was turned, I repented; and after I was instructed, I smote upon [my] <SUP><span>z</span></SUP> thigh: I was ashamed, and even confounded, because I bore the reproach of my youth. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>z</span>) In sign of repentance and detestation of my sin. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jer31_20"></a><B><a href="/jeremiah/31-20.html">31:20</a></B> [Is] Ephraim <SUP><span>a</span></SUP> my dear son? [is he] a pleasant child? for since I spoke against him, I do earnestly <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> remember him still: therefore my heart is troubled for him; I will surely have mercy upon him, saith the LORD. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>a</span>) As though he would say no for by his iniquity he did what lay in him to cast me off. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jer31_21"></a><B><a href="/jeremiah/31-21.html">31:21</a></B> Set thee up <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> waymarks, make thee high heaps: set thy heart toward the highway, [even] the way [which] thou wentest: turn again, O virgin of Israel, turn again to these thy cities. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) Mark by what way you went into captivity and you will turn again by the same. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jer31_22"></a><B><a href="/jeremiah/31-22.html">31:22</a></B> How long wilt thou wander about, O thou backsliding daughter? for the LORD hath created <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> a new thing in the earth, A woman shall encompass a man. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) Because their deliverance from Babylon was a figure of their deliverance from sin, he shows how this would be procured that is, by Jesus Christ, whom a woman would conceive and bear in her womb. Which is a strange thing in earth, because he would be born of a virgin without man or he means that Jerusalem which was like a barren woman in her captivity would be fruitful as she that is joined in marriage and whom God blesses with children. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Jer31_23"></a><a name="Jer31_24"></a><a name="Jer31_25"></a><a name="Jer31_26"></a><B><a href="/jeremiah/31-26.html">31:26</a></B> Upon this I awoke, and beheld;
