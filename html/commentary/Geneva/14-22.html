So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>a</span>) Meaning the Philistines. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ch22_1"</a><B><a href="/2-chronicles/22-2.html">22:2</a></B> <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> Forty and two years old [was] Ahaziah when he began to reign, and he reigned <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> one year in Jerusalem. His mothers name also [was] Athaliah the daughter <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> of Omri. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>b</span>) Read ( <a href="/2-chronicles/21-20.html">2&nbsp;Chronicles 21:20</a> ). <BR>(<span>c</span>) That is, after the death of his father. <BR>(<span>d</span>) She was Ahabs daughter, who was the son of Omri. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ch22_2"</a><a name="2Ch22_3"</a><B><a href="/2-chronicles/22-4.html">22:4</a></B> Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the LORD like the house of Ahab: for they were his <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> counsellors after the death of his father to his destruction. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) He shows that it follows that the rulers are as their counsellors are and that there cannot be a good king who allows wicked counsellors. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ch22_4"</a><a name="2Ch22_5"</a><a name="2Ch22_6"</a><B><a href="/2-chronicles/22-7.html">22:7</a></B> And the destruction of Ahaziah <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> was of God by coming to Joram: for when he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) By this we see that nothing can come to any but by Gods providence and as he has appointed, and therefore he causes everything to serve his purposes. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ch22_7"</a><a name="2Ch22_8"</a><B><a href="/2-chronicles/22-9.html">22:9</a></B> And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him, (for he was hid in Samaria,) and brought him to Jehu: and when they had slain him, they buried him: Because, said they, he [is] the son of <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart. So the house of Ahaziah had no power to keep still the kingdom. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) This was the just plague of God because he joined himself with Gods enemies: yet God to declare the worthiness of Jehoshaphat his grandfather moved them to give him the honour of burial. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ch22_9"</a><B><a href="/2-chronicles/22-10.html">22:10</a></B> But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> destroyed all the seed royal of the house of Judah. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) So that there would be no one to claim the crown and so she might usurp the government. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ch22_10"</a><a name="2Ch22_11"</a><B><a href="/2-chronicles/22-12.html">22:12</a></B> And he was with them hid in the <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> house of God six years: and Athaliah reigned over the <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> land. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) Meaning, in the chamber where the priests and Levites slept, who kept their courses weekly in the temple. <BR>(<span>k</span>) That is, of Judah. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
