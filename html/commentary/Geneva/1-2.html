		<span><B><a href="/genesis/2.html">Chapter 2</a></B></span><P><span><a name="Ge2_1"></a><B><a href="/genesis/2-1.html">2:1</a></B> Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the <SUP><span>a</span></SUP> host of them. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>a</span>) That is, the innumerable abundance of creatures in heaven and earth. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge2_2"></a><B><a href="/genesis/2-2.html">2:2</a></B> And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>b</span>) For he had now finished his creation, but his providence still watches over his creatures and governs them. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge2_3"></a><B><a href="/genesis/2-3.html">2:3</a></B> And God blessed the seventh day, and <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) Appointed it to be kept holy, that man might in it consider the excellency of his works and Gods goodness toward him. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge2_4"></a><a name="Ge2_5"></a><B><a href="/genesis/2-5.html">2:5</a></B> And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> rain upon the earth, and [there was] not a man to till the ground. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) God only opens the heavens and shuts them, he sends drought and rain according to his good pleasure. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge2_6"></a><a name="Ge2_7"></a><B><a href="/genesis/2-7.html">2:7</a></B> And the LORD God formed man <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> [of] the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) He shows what mans body was created from, to the intent that man should not glory in the excellency of his own nature. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge2_8"></a><B><a href="/genesis/2-8.html">2:8</a></B> And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) This was the name of a place, as some think in Mesopotamia, most pleasant and abundant in all things. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge2_9"></a><B><a href="/genesis/2-9.html">2:9</a></B> And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> tree of life also in the midst of the garden, <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> and the tree of knowledge of good and evil. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) Who was a sign of the life received from God. <BR>(<span>h</span>) That is, of miserable experience, which came by disobeying God. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge2_10"></a><a name="Ge2_11"></a><B><a href="/genesis/2-11.html">2:11</a></B> The name of the first [is] Pison: that [is] it which compasseth the whole land <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> of Havilah, where [there is] gold; <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) Havilah is a country adjoining Persia to the east, and inclining towards the west. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge2_12"></a><a name="Ge2_13"></a><a name="Ge2_14"></a><a name="Ge2_15"></a><B><a href="/genesis/2-15.html">2:15</a></B> And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> dress it and to keep it. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) God would not have man idle, though as yet there was no need to labour. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge2_16"></a><B><a href="/genesis/2-16.html">2:16</a></B> And the LORD God <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>l</span>) So that man might know there was a sovereign Lord, to whom he owed obedience. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge2_17"></a><B><a href="/genesis/2-17.html">2:17</a></B> But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely <SUP><span>m</span></SUP> die. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>m</span>) By death he means the separation of man from God, who is our life and chief happiness: and also that our disobedience is the cause of it. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge2_18"></a><a name="Ge2_19"></a><B><a href="/genesis/2-19.html">2:19</a></B> And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought [them] unto <SUP><span>n</span></SUP> Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that [was] the name thereof. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>n</span>) By moving them to come and submit themselves to Adam. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge2_20"></a><a name="Ge2_21"></a><a name="Ge2_22"></a><B><a href="/genesis/2-22.html">2:22</a></B> And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a <SUP><span>o</span></SUP> woman, and brought her unto the man. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>o</span>) Signifying that mankind was perfect, when the woman was created, who before was like an imperfect building. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge2_23"></a><a name="Ge2_24"></a><B><a href="/genesis/2-24.html">2:24</a></B> Therefore shall a man leave <SUP><span>p</span></SUP> his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>p</span>) So marriage requires a greater duty of us toward our wives, than otherwise we are bound to show to our parents. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge2_25"></a><B><a href="/genesis/2-25.html">2:25</a></B> And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not <SUP><span>q</span></SUP> ashamed. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>q</span>) For before sin entered, all things were honest and comely. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
