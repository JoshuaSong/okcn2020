And he said, Yea, I <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> know [it]; hold ye your peace. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>b</span>) So called, because they are begotten anew as it were by the heavenly doctrine. <BR>(<span>c</span>) That is, from being your head any more: for to be as the head, is to be the master, as to be at the feet, is to be a scholar. <BR>(<span>d</span>) For the Lord had revealed it to him. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki2_3"</a><a name="2Ki2_4"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/2-5.html">2:5</a></B> And the sons of the prophets that [were] at <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> Jericho came to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he answered, Yea, I know [it]; hold ye your peace. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) Not only at Bethel, but at Jericho and other places were there prophets, who had scholars, whom they instructed and brought up in the true fear of God. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki2_5"</a><a name="2Ki2_6"</a><a name="2Ki2_7"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/2-8.html">2:8</a></B> And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped [it] together, and smote the <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) That is, of Jordan. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki2_8"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/2-9.html">2:9</a></B> And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) Let your spirit have double force in me, because of these dangerous times: or let me have twice as much as the rest of the prophets: or if your spirit were to be divided into three parts, let me have two. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki2_9"</a><a name="2Ki2_10"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/2-11.html">2:11</a></B> And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, [there appeared] a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> heaven. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) Thus God has left a testimony in all ages (both before the law, in the law and in the gospel). </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki2_11"</a><a name="2Ki2_12"</a><a name="2Ki2_13"</a><a name="2Ki2_14"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/2-15.html">2:15</a></B> And when the sons of the prophets which [were] to view at Jericho saw him, they said, The <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) The Spirit of prophecy was given to him as it was to Elijah. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki2_15"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/2-16.html">2:16</a></B> And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: lest peradventure the Spirit of the LORD hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> Ye shall not send. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>l</span>) Because the fact was extraordinary, they doubted where he had gone, but Elisha was assured that he was taken up to God. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki2_16"</a><a name="2Ki2_17"</a><a name="2Ki2_18"</a><a name="2Ki2_19"</a><a name="2Ki2_20"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/2-21.html">2:21</a></B> And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast <SUP><span>m</span></SUP> the salt in there, and said, Thus saith the LORD, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or barren [land]. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>m</span>) Thus God gave him power, even contrary to nature, to make the water profitable for mans use, which before was hurtful. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki2_21"</a><a name="2Ki2_22"</a><a name="2Ki2_23"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/2-24.html">2:24</a></B> And he turned back, and looked on them, and <SUP><span>n</span></SUP> cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>n</span>) Perceiving their malicious heart against the Lord and his word, he asks God to avenge the injury done to him. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
