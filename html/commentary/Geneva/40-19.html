		<span><B><a href="/matthew/19.html">Chapter 19</a></B></span><P><span><a name="Mt19_1"></a><B><a href="/matthew/19-1.html">19:1</a></B> And it came to pass, [that] when Jesus had finished these sayings, he <SUP><span>a</span></SUP> departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan; <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>a</span>) Passed over the water out of Galilee into the borders of Judea. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mt19_2"></a><a name="Mt19_3"></a><B><a href="/matthew/19-3.html">19:3</a></B> <SUP><span>1</span></SUP> The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> put away his wife for every cause? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>1</span>) The band of marriage ought not to be broken, unless it is because of fornication. <BR>(<span>b</span>) To send her a bill of divorce; see ( <a href="/matthew/1-19.html">Matthew 1:19</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mt19_4"></a><a name="Mt19_5"></a><B><a href="/matthew/19-5.html">19:5</a></B> And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> cleave to his wife: and they <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> twain shall be one flesh? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) The Greek word conveys "to be glued unto", by which it signifies the union by marriage, which is between man and wife, as though they were glued together. <BR>(<span>d</span>) They who were two become one as it were: and this word "flesh" is figuratively taken for the whole man, or the body, after the manner of the Hebrews. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mt19_6"></a><B><a href="/matthew/19-6.html">19:6</a></B> Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> joined together, let not man put asunder. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) Has made them yokefellows, as the marriage itself is called a yoke, by a borrowed kind of speech. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mt19_7"></a><B><a href="/matthew/19-7.html">19:7</a></B> <SUP><span>2</span></SUP> They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>2</span>) Because political laws are adjusted to allow some things, it does not follow that God therefore approves of them. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mt19_8"></a><B><a href="/matthew/19-8.html">19:8</a></B> He saith unto them, Moses <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> because of the hardness of your hearts <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) Being brought about because of the hardness of your hearts. <BR>(<span>g</span>) By a political law, not by the moral law: for the moral law is a perpetual law of Gods justice; the other bows and bends as the carpenters bevel. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mt19_9"></a><B><a href="/matthew/19-9.html">19:9</a></B> And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except [it be] <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) Therefore in these days the laws that were made against adulterers were not regarded: for they would have no need of divorce, if the marriage had been severed by punishment of death. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mt19_10"></a><B><a href="/matthew/19-10.html">19:10</a></B> His disciples say unto him, If the <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> case of the man be so with [his] wife, it is not good to marry. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) If the matter stands in this way between man and wife, or in marriage. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mt19_11"></a><B><a href="/matthew/19-11.html">19:11</a></B> <SUP><span>3</span></SUP> But he said unto them, All [men] cannot <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> receive this saying, save [they] to whom it is given. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>3</span>) The gift of celibacy is peculiar, and therefore no man can set a law to himself of perpetual celibacy. <BR>(<span>k</span>) Receive and admit, as by translation we say, that a straight and narrow place is not able to receive many things. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mt19_12"></a><B><a href="/matthew/19-12.html">19:12</a></B> For there are some <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> eunuchs, which were so born from [their] mothers womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have <SUP><span>m</span></SUP> made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heavens sake. He that is able to receive [it], let him receive [it]. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>l</span>) A man can become a eunuch in one of two ways: the first is by castration or emasculation, and the other by natural causes, such as a rupture. <BR>(<span>m</span>) Who abstain from marriage, and live as celibates through the gift of God. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mt19_13"></a><B><a href="/matthew/19-13.html">19:13</a></B> <SUP><span>4</span></SUP> Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should put [his] hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>4</span>) The elect infants and little children are contained in the free covenant of God. (Ed.) <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mt19_14"></a><a name="Mt19_15"></a><a name="Mt19_16"></a><B><a href="/matthew/19-16.html">19:16</a></B> <SUP><span>5</span></SUP> And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>5</span>) Those who seek to be saved by the law do not even know the law themselves. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mt19_17"></a><a name="Mt19_18"></a><a name="Mt19_19"></a><a name="Mt19_20"></a><a name="Mt19_21"></a><B><a href="/matthew/19-21.html">19:21</a></B> Jesus said unto him, If <SUP><span>n</span></SUP> thou wilt be perfect, go [and] sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come [and] follow me. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>n</span>) The young man did not answer truly in saying that he had kept all the commandments: and therefore Christ sets forth an example of true charity before him, to show the disease that lay lurking in his mind. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mt19_22"></a><a name="Mt19_23"></a><B><a href="/matthew/19-23.html">19:23</a></B> <SUP><span>6</span></SUP> Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>6</span>) Rich men have need of a singular gift of God to escape out of the snares of Satan. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mt19_24"></a><B><a href="/matthew/19-24.html">19:24</a></B> And again I say unto you, It is <SUP><span>o</span></SUP> easier for a <SUP><span>p</span></SUP> camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>o</span>) Literally, "it is of less labour". <BR>(<span>p</span>) Theophylact notes, that by this word is meant a cable rope, but Caninius alleges out of the Talmuds that it is a proverb, and the word "Camel" signifies the beast itself. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mt19_25"></a><a name="Mt19_26"></a><a name="Mt19_27"></a><a name="Mt19_28"></a><B><a href="/matthew/19-28.html">19:28</a></B> <SUP><span>7</span></SUP> And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the <SUP><span>q</span></SUP> regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>7</span>) It is not lost, that is neglected for Gods sake. <BR>(<span>q</span>) The regeneration is understood to mean that day when the elect will begin to live a new life, that is to say, when they will enjoy the heavenly inheritance, both in body and soul. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mt19_29"></a><a name="Mt19_30"></a><B><a href="/matthew/19-30.html">19:30</a></B> <SUP><span>8</span></SUP> But many [that are] first shall be last; and the last [shall be] first. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>8</span>) To have begun well, and not to continue unto the end, is not only unprofitable, but also hurts very much. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
