Here also is declared the zeal of the children of God when they are called. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa2_3"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/2-3.html">2:3</a></B> And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> law, and the word of the LORD from <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> Jerusalem. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) Alluding to mount Zion, where the visible Church then was. <BR>(<span>e</span>) Meaning, the whole doctrine of salvation. <BR>(<span>f</span>) This was accomplished when the gospel was first preached in Jerusalem, and from there went through all the world. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa2_4"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/2-4.html">2:4</a></B> And <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> he shall judge among the nations, and shall <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> rebuke many people: and they shall <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> war any more. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) The Lord, who is Christ, will have all power given to him. <BR>(<span>h</span>) That they may acknowledge their sins, and turn to him. <BR>(<span>i</span>) He shows the fruit of the peace which the gospel should bring, that is, that men should do good to one another, while before they were enemies. <BR>(<span>k</span>) He speaks not against the use of weapons and lawful war, but shows how the hearts of the godly will be affected one toward another, which peace and love begin and grow in this life, but will be perfected when we are joined with our head Jesus Christ. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa2_5"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/2-5.html">2:5</a></B> O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> walk in the light of the LORD. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>l</span>) Seeing the Gentiles will be ready, make haste, and show them the way to worship God. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa2_6"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/2-6.html">2:6</a></B> Therefore thou <SUP><span>m</span></SUP> hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob, because they are <SUP><span>n</span></SUP> filled [with customs] from the east, and [are] soothsayers like the Philistines, <SUP><span>o</span></SUP> and they please themselves in the children of foreigners. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>m</span>) The prophet seeing the small hope that the Jews would convert, complains to God as though he had utterly forsaken them for their sins. <BR>(<span>n</span>) Full of the corruptions that reigned chiefly in the east parts. <BR>(<span>o</span>) They altogether gave themselves to the fashions of other nations. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa2_7"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/2-7.html">2:7</a></B> Their land also is full of <SUP><span>p</span></SUP> silver and gold, neither [is there any] end of their treasures;
