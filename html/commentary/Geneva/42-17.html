<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>4</span>) Seeing that God may rightfully claim for himself both us and all that is ours, he cannot be indebted to us for anything, although we labour mightily until we die. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu17_8"></a><a name="Lu17_9"></a><a name="Lu17_10"></a><B><a href="/luke/17-10.html">17:10</a></B> <SUP><span>5</span></SUP> So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>5</span>) No matter how perfectly we may keep the law, it deserves no reward. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu17_11"></a><B><a href="/luke/17-11.html">17:11</a></B> <SUP><span>6</span></SUP> And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>6</span>) Christ does good even to those who will be unthankful, but the benefits of God to salvation only profit those who are thankful. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu17_12"></a><a name="Lu17_13"></a><a name="Lu17_14"></a><a name="Lu17_15"></a><a name="Lu17_16"></a><a name="Lu17_17"></a><a name="Lu17_18"></a><a name="Lu17_19"></a><a name="Lu17_20"></a><B><a href="/luke/17-20.html">17:20</a></B> <SUP><span>7</span></SUP> And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> observation: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>7</span>) The kingdom of God is not discerned by many although it is most present before their eyes, because they foolishly persuade themselves that it is to come with outward pomp. <BR>(<span>b</span>) With any outward pomp and show of majesty to be known by: for there were still many plain and evident tokens by which men might have understood that Christ was the Messiah, whose kingdom had been so long looked for: but he speaks in this place of those signs which the Pharisees dreamed of, who looked for an earthly Messianic kingdom. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu17_21"></a><B><a href="/luke/17-21.html">17:21</a></B> Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> within you. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) You look around for the Messiah as though he were absent, but he is amongst you in the midst of you. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu17_22"></a><B><a href="/luke/17-22.html">17:22</a></B> <SUP><span>8</span></SUP> And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye shall desire to see <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see [it]. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>8</span>) We often neglect those things when they are present which we afterward desire when they are gone, but in vain. <BR>(<span>d</span>) The time will come when you will seek for the Son of Man with great sorrow of heart, and will not find him. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu17_23"></a><B><a href="/luke/17-23.html">17:23</a></B> <SUP><span>9</span></SUP> And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after [them], nor follow [them]. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>9</span>) Christ forewarns us that false Christs will come, and that his glory will suddenly be spread far and wide through the world after the shame of the cross is put out and extinguished. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu17_24"></a><a name="Lu17_25"></a><a name="Lu17_26"></a><B><a href="/luke/17-26.html">17:26</a></B> <SUP><span>10</span></SUP> And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>10</span>) The world will be taken by surprise with the sudden judgment of God, and therefore the faithful ought to continually watch. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu17_27"></a><a name="Lu17_28"></a><a name="Lu17_29"></a><a name="Lu17_30"></a><a name="Lu17_31"></a><B><a href="/luke/17-31.html">17:31</a></B> <SUP><span>11</span></SUP> In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>11</span>) We must pay careful attention that neither distrust nor the enticements of this world, nor any consideration of friendship hinder us in the least way. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu17_32"></a><a name="Lu17_33"></a><B><a href="/luke/17-33.html">17:33</a></B> Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> preserve it. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) That is, will save it, as Matthew expounds it: for the life that is spoken of here is everlasting salvation. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu17_34"></a><a name="Lu17_35"></a><a name="Lu17_36"></a><a name="Lu17_37"></a><B><a href="/luke/17-37.html">17:37</a></B> <SUP><span>12</span></SUP> And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord?
