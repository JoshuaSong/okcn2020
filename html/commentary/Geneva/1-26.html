And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>a</span>) In the land of Canaan. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge26_2"></a><B><a href="/genesis/26-2.html">26:2</a></B> And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>b</span>) Gods providence always watches to direct the ways of his children. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge26_3"></a><a name="Ge26_4"></a><a name="Ge26_5"></a><B><a href="/genesis/26-5.html">26:5</a></B> Because that Abraham <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) He commends Abrahams obedience, because Isaac should be even more ready to follow the same: for as God made this promise of his free mercy, so does the confirmation of it proceed from the same fountain. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge26_6"></a><a name="Ge26_7"></a><B><a href="/genesis/26-7.html">26:7</a></B> And the men of the place asked [him] of his wife; and he said, She [is] my sister: <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> for he feared to say, [She is] my wife; lest, [said he], the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she [was] fair to look upon. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) By which we see that fear and distrust is found in the most faithful. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge26_8"></a><B><a href="/genesis/26-8.html">26:8</a></B> And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac [was] <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> sporting with Rebekah his wife. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) Or showing some familiar sign of love, by which it might be known that she was his wife. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge26_9"></a><a name="Ge26_10"></a><B><a href="/genesis/26-10.html">26:10</a></B> And Abimelech said, What [is] this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> guiltiness upon us. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) In all ages men were persuaded that Gods vengeance would come on adulterers. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge26_11"></a><a name="Ge26_12"></a><a name="Ge26_13"></a><a name="Ge26_14"></a><B><a href="/genesis/26-14.html">26:14</a></B> For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> envied him. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) The malicious always envy the graces of God in others. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge26_15"></a><a name="Ge26_16"></a><a name="Ge26_17"></a><B><a href="/genesis/26-17.html">26:17</a></B> And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> valley of Gerar, and dwelt there. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) The Hebrew word signifies a flood, or valley, where water at any time runs. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge26_18"></a><a name="Ge26_19"></a><a name="Ge26_20"></a><a name="Ge26_21"></a><a name="Ge26_22"></a><a name="Ge26_23"></a><a name="Ge26_24"></a><B><a href="/genesis/26-24.html">26:24</a></B> And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I [am] the God <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I [am] with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abrahams sake. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) God assures Isaac against all fear by rehearsing the promise made to Abraham. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge26_25"></a><B><a href="/genesis/26-25.html">26:25</a></B> And he builded an <SUP><span>x</span></SUP> altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaacs servants digged a well. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>x</span>) To signify that he would serve no other God, but the God of his father Abraham. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge26_26"></a><a name="Ge26_27"></a><a name="Ge26_28"></a><a name="Ge26_29"></a><B><a href="/genesis/26-29.html">26:29</a></B> <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou [art] now the blessed of the LORD. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>l</span>) The Hebrews in swearing begin commonly with "If" and understand the rest, that is, that God will punish him who breaks the oath: here the wicked show that they are afraid lest that happen to them which they would do to others. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
