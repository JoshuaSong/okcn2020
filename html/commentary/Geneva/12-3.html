And he said, I will go up: <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> I [am] as thou [art], my people as thy people, [and] my horses as thy horses. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) Read ( <a href="/1-kings/22-4.html">1&nbsp;Kings 22:4</a> ). </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki3_7"</a><a name="2Ki3_8"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/3-9.html">3:9</a></B> So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> king of Edom: and they fetched a compass of seven days journey: and there was no water for the host, and for the cattle that followed them. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) Meaning the viceroy, or lieutenant of the king of Judah, ( <a href="/1-kings/22-47.html">1&nbsp;Kings 22:47</a> ). </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki3_9"</a><a name="2Ki3_10"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/3-11.html">3:11</a></B> But Jehoshaphat said, [Is there] not here a prophet of the LORD, that we may enquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of Israels servants answered and said, Here [is] Elisha the son of Shaphat, which <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> poured water on the hands of Elijah. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) That is, who was his servant. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki3_11"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/3-12.html">3:12</a></B> And Jehoshaphat said, <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> The word of the LORD is with him.
