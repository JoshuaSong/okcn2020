		<span><B><a href="/hebrews/13.html">Chapter 13</a></B></span><P><span><a name="Heb13_1"></a><B><a href="/hebrews/13-1.html">13:1</a></B> Let <SUP><span>1</span></SUP> brotherly love continue. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>1</span>) He comes to the second table of the law, the sum of which is charity, especially toward strangers and such as are afflicted. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Heb13_2"></a><a name="Heb13_3"></a><B><a href="/hebrews/13-3.html">13:3</a></B> Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; [and] them which suffer adversity, as <SUP><span>a</span></SUP> being yourselves also in the body. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>a</span>) Be so touched, as if their misery were yours. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Heb13_4"></a><B><a href="/hebrews/13-4.html">13:4</a></B> <SUP><span>2</span></SUP> Marriage [is] honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>2</span>) He commends chaste matrimony in all sorts of men, and threatens utter destruction from God against whoremongers and adulterers. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Heb13_5"></a><B><a href="/hebrews/13-5.html">13:5</a></B> <SUP><span>3</span></SUP> [Let your] conversation [be] without covetousness; [and be] content with such things as ye have: for <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>3</span>) Covetousness is condemned, against which is set a contented mind with that which the Lord has given. <BR>(<span>b</span>) Even the Lord himself. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Heb13_6"></a><B><a href="/hebrews/13-6.html">13:6</a></B> So that we may boldly say, The Lord [is] my helper, and I will not fear what <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> man shall do unto me. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) He contrasts man with God. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Heb13_7"></a><B><a href="/hebrews/13-7.html">13:7</a></B> <SUP><span>4</span></SUP> Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of [their] conversation. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>4</span>) We have to set before us the examples of valiant captains, whom we ought diligently to follow. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Heb13_8"></a><B><a href="/hebrews/13-8.html">13:8</a></B> <SUP><span>5</span></SUP> Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>5</span>) He repeats the sum of the doctrine, that is, the only ground of all precepts of conduct, and that is this: That we ought to quiet and content ourselves in Christ only: for there has never been any man saved without the knowledge of him, neither is there today, nor shall there be ever. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Heb13_9"></a><B><a href="/hebrews/13-9.html">13:9</a></B> Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. <SUP><span>6</span></SUP> For [it is] a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> meats, which have not profited them that have been <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> occupied therein. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>6</span>) He speaks to those who mixed an external worship and especially the difference of meats with the gospel which he clearly condemns as repugnant to the benefit of Christ. <BR>(<span>d</span>) By this one form which concerns the difference of clean and unclean meat, we have to understand all the ceremonial worship. <BR>(<span>e</span>) Who observed the difference of them superstitiously. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Heb13_10"></a><B><a href="/hebrews/13-10.html">13:10</a></B> <SUP><span>7</span></SUP> We have an <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> altar, whereof they have no right to eat which <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> serve the tabernacle. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>7</span>) He refutes their error by an apt and fit comparison. They who in times past served the Tabernacle, did not eat of the sacrifices whose blood was brought for sin into the holy place by the high priest. Moreover these sacrifices represented Christ our offering. Therefore they cannot be partakers of him if they serve the tabernacle, that is, stand in the service of the law: but let us not be ashamed to follow him out of Jerusalem, from which he was cast out and suffered for in this also Christ, who is the truth, answers that type in that he suffered outside the gate. <BR>(<span>f</span>) By the altar, he means the offerings. <BR>(<span>g</span>) Of which they cannot be partakers, who stubbornly retain the rites of the law. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Heb13_11"></a><a name="Heb13_12"></a><a name="Heb13_13"></a><B><a href="/hebrews/13-13.html">13:13</a></B> <SUP><span>8</span></SUP> Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>8</span>) He goes on further in this comparison, and shows that this also signified to us, that the godly followers of Christ must go out of the world bearing his cross. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Heb13_14"></a><a name="Heb13_15"></a><B><a href="/hebrews/13-15.html">13:15</a></B> <SUP><span>9</span></SUP> By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of [our] lips giving thanks to his name. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>9</span>) Now that those physical sacrifices are taken away, he teaches us that the true sacrifices of confession remain, which consist partly in giving thanks, and partly in liberality, with which sacrifices indeed God is now delighted. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Heb13_16"></a><a name="Heb13_17"></a><B><a href="/hebrews/13-17.html">13:17</a></B> <SUP><span>10</span></SUP> Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that [is] unprofitable for you. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>10</span>) We must obey the warnings and admonitions of our ministers and elders, who watch for the salvation of the souls that are committed to them. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Heb13_18"></a><B><a href="/hebrews/13-18.html">13:18</a></B> <SUP><span>11</span></SUP> Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>11</span>) The last part of this epistle, in which he commends his ministry to the Hebrews, and wishes them steadfastness and increase of graces from the Lord: and excuses himself in that he has used but few words to comfort them having spent the epistle in disputing: and salutes certain brethren in a familiar and friendly manner. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Heb13_19"></a><a name="Heb13_20"></a><a name="Heb13_21"></a><B><a href="/hebrews/13-21.html">13:21</a></B> Make you <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> perfect in every good work to do his will, <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom [be] glory for ever and ever. Amen. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) Make you fit or suitable. <BR>(<span>i</span>) From this comes that saying of the fathers, that God crowns his work in us. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
