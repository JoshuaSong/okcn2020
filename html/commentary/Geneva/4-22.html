And Balak the son of Zippor [was] king of the Moabites at that time. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>b</span>) Who were the heads and governors. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Nu22_5"></a><B><a href="/numbers/22-5.html">22:5</a></B> He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor, which [is] by the <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> river of the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) That is, Euphrates, upon which stood this city Pethor. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Nu22_6"></a><a name="Nu22_7"></a><B><a href="/numbers/22-7.html">22:7</a></B> And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) Thinking to bribe him with gifts to curse the Israelites. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Nu22_8"></a><B><a href="/numbers/22-8.html">22:8</a></B> And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the LORD shall speak unto me: and <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> the princes of Moab abode with Balaam. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) Whom before he called elders: meaning the governors, and later calls them servants: that is, subjects to their king. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Nu22_9"></a><a name="Nu22_10"></a><a name="Nu22_11"></a><a name="Nu22_12"></a><B><a href="/numbers/22-12.html">22:12</a></B> And God <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people: for they [are] blessed. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) He warned him by a dream, that he should not consent to the kings wicked request. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Nu22_13"></a><B><a href="/numbers/22-13.html">22:13</a></B> And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak, Get you into your land: for the LORD refuseth to give <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> me leave to go with you. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) Or else he would have been willing, covetousness had so blinded his heart. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Nu22_14"></a><a name="Nu22_15"></a><a name="Nu22_16"></a><B><a href="/numbers/22-16.html">22:16</a></B> And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor, <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) The wicked seek by all means to further their naughty enterprises, though they know that God is against them. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Nu22_17"></a><a name="Nu22_18"></a><a name="Nu22_19"></a><B><a href="/numbers/22-19.html">22:19</a></B> Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the LORD will say unto me <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> more. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) Because he tempted God to require him contrary to his commandment, his petition was granted, but it turned to his own condemnation. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Nu22_20"></a><a name="Nu22_21"></a><a name="Nu22_22"></a><B><a href="/numbers/22-22.html">22:22</a></B> And Gods anger was kindled because he <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> went: and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him.
