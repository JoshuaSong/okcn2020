So the prophet Amos says that the day of the Lord will be darkness; ( <a href="/amos/5-20.html">Amos 5:20</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Mr13_20"></a><a name="Mr13_21"></a><a name="Mr13_22"></a><a name="Mr13_23"></a><a name="Mr13_24"></a><a name="Mr13_25"></a><a name="Mr13_26"></a><a name="Mr13_27"></a><a name="Mr13_28"></a><a name="Mr13_29"></a><a name="Mr13_30"></a><a name="Mr13_31"></a><a name="Mr13_32"></a><B><a href="/mark/13-32.html">13:32</a></B> <SUP><span>2</span></SUP> But of that day and [that] hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>2</span>) The latter day is not to be searched for curiously, which day the Father alone knows: but let us rather take heed that it does not come upon us unaware. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
