for he strengthened [himself] exceedingly. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) That is, they paid tribute in a sign of subjection. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ch26_8"</a><B><a href="/2-chronicles/26-9.html">26:9</a></B> Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> turning [of the wall], and fortified them. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) Where the wall or tower turns. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ch26_9"</a><B><a href="/2-chronicles/26-10.html">26:10</a></B> Also he built towers in the desert, and digged many wells: for he had much cattle, both in the low country, and in the plains: husbandmen [also], and vine dressers in the mountains, and in <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> Carmel: for he loved husbandry. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) That is, in mount Carmel, or as the word signifies in the fruitful field, it is also taken for a green ear of corn when it is full, ( <a href="/leviticus/2-14.html">Leviticus 2:14</a> ). </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ch26_10"</a><a name="2Ch26_11"</a><B><a href="/2-chronicles/26-12.html">26:12</a></B> The whole <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men of valour [were] two thousand and six hundred. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) Of the chief officers of the kings house, or of the captains and sergeants for war. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ch26_12"</a><a name="2Ch26_13"</a><a name="2Ch26_14"</a><a name="2Ch26_15"</a><B><a href="/2-chronicles/26-16.html">26:16</a></B> But when he was strong, his heart <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> was lifted up to [his] destruction: for he transgressed against the LORD his God, and went into the temple of the LORD to burn incense upon the altar of incense. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) Thus prosperity causes men to trust in themselves and by forgetting him who is the author of it, procure their own punishment. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ch26_16"</a><a name="2Ch26_17"</a><B><a href="/2-chronicles/26-18.html">26:18</a></B> And they withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto him, [It appertaineth] not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the LORD, but to the priests the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn incense: <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> go out of the sanctuary; for thou hast trespassed; neither [shall it be] for thine honour from the LORD God. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) Though his zeal seemed to be good and also his intention, yet because they were not governed by the word of God, he did wickedly and was therefore both justly resisted and also punished. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ch26_18"</a><a name="2Ch26_19"</a><a name="2Ch26_20"</a><B><a href="/2-chronicles/26-21.html">26:21</a></B> And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> several house, [being] a leper; for he was cut off from the house of the LORD: and Jotham his son [was] over the kings house, judging the people of the land. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>l</span>) According to the commandment of the Lord, ( <a href="/leviticus/13-46.html">Leviticus 13:46</a> ). </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ch26_21"</a><a name="2Ch26_22"</a><B><a href="/2-chronicles/26-23.html">26:23</a></B> So Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial which [belonged] to the kings; for they said, He <SUP><span>m</span></SUP> [is] a leper: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>m</span>) Therefore was buried apart in the same field but not in the same sepulchre with his predecessors. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
