[them that are] weaned from the milk, [and] drawn from the breasts. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) For there was no one that was able to understand any good doctrine: but were foolish and as unfit as young babes. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa28_10"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/28-10.html">28:10</a></B> For <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> precept [must be] upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, [and] there a little: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) They must have one thing often repeated. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa28_11"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/28-11.html">28:11</a></B> For with stammering <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> lips and another tongue will he speak to this people. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) Let one teach what he can, yet they will no more understand him, than if he spoke in a strange language. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa28_12"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/28-12.html">28:12</a></B> To whom <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> he said, <SUP><span>m</span></SUP> This [is] the rest [with which] ye may <SUP><span>n</span></SUP> cause the weary to rest; and this [is] the refreshing: yet they would not hear. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>l</span>) That is, the prophet, whom God would send. <BR>(<span>m</span>) This is the doctrine on which you ought to stay and rest. <BR>(<span>n</span>) Show to them that are weary and have need of rest, what the true rest is. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa28_13"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/28-13.html">28:13</a></B> But the word of the <SUP><span>o</span></SUP> LORD was to them precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, [and] there a little; that they might go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>o</span>) Because they will not receive the word of God, when it is offered, it comes of their own malice, if after their hearts are so hardened, that they care not for it, as before, ( <a href="/isaiah/6-9.html">Isaiah 6:9</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa28_14"></a><a name="Isa28_15"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/28-15.html">28:15</a></B> Because ye have said, We have made a <SUP><span>p</span></SUP> covenant with death, and with hell are we in agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not reach us: for we have made lies our refuge, and under <SUP><span>q</span></SUP> falsehood have we hid ourselves: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>p</span>) They thought they had shifts to avoid Gods judgments, and that they could escape though all others perished. <BR>(<span>q</span>) Though the prophets condemned their idols and vain fruit of falsehood and vanity, yet the wicked thought in themselves that they would trust in these things. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa28_16"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/28-16.html">28:16</a></B> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a <SUP><span>r</span></SUP> tried stone, a precious corner [stone], a sure foundation: he that believeth <SUP><span>s</span></SUP> shall not make haste. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>r</span>) That is, Christ, by whom all the building must be tried and upheld, ( <a href="/psalms/118-22.html">Psalms 118:22</a> ;

and bring to pass his act, his strange act. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>a</span>) When David overcame the Philistines, ( <a href="/2-samuel/5-20.html">2&nbsp;Samuel 5:20</a> ;  <a href="/1-chronicles/14-11.html">1&nbsp;Chronicles 14:11</a> ). <BR>(<span>b</span>) Where Joshua discomfited five kings of the Amorites, ( <a href="/joshua/10-12.html">Joshua 10:12</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa28_22"></a><a name="Isa28_23"></a><a name="Isa28_24"></a><a name="Isa28_25"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/28-25.html">28:25</a></B> When he hath made <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> even the face of it, doth he not cast abroad the black cummin, and scatter the cummin, and cast in the wheat in rows and the appointed barley and the rye in their place? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) As the plowman has his appointed time, and various instruments for his labour, so has the Lord for his vengeance: for he punishes some at one time, and some at another, some after one sort, and some after another, so that his chosen seed is beaten and tried, but not broken as are the wicked. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
