Blessed [is he whose] transgression [is] <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> forgiven, [whose] sin [is] covered. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>a</span>) Concerning the free remission of sins, which is the chief point of our faith. <BR>(<span>b</span>) To be justified by faith, is to have our sins freely remitted, and to be declared just, ( <a href="/romans/4-6.html">Romans 4:6</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps32_2"></a><a name="Ps32_3"></a><B><a href="/psalms/32-3.html">32:3</a></B> When I kept <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> silence, my bones waxed old through my <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> roaring all the day long. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) Between hope and despair. <BR>(<span>d</span>) Was not eased by silence nor crying, signifying that before the sinner is reconciled to God, he feels a perpetual torment. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps32_4"></a><a name="Ps32_5"></a><B><a href="/psalms/32-5.html">32:5</a></B> I <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) He shows that as Gods mercy is the only cause of forgiveness of sins, so the means of it are repentance and confession which proceed from faith. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps32_6"></a><B><a href="/psalms/32-6.html">32:6</a></B> For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> they shall not come nigh unto him. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>f</span>) When necessity causes him to seek you for help, ( <a href="/isaiah/55-6.html">Isaiah 55:6</a> ). <BR>(<span>g</span>) That is, the waters and great dangers. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps32_7"></a><a name="Ps32_8"></a><B><a href="/psalms/32-8.html">32:8</a></B> I will <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) David promises to make the rest of Gods children partakers of the benefits which he felt, and that he will diligently look and take care to direct them in the way of salvation. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps32_9"></a><B><a href="/psalms/32-9.html">32:9</a></B> Be ye not as the horse, [or] as the mule, [which] have no understanding: whose <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto thee. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) If men can rule brute beasts, do they think that God will not bridle and tame their rage? <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps32_10"></a><a name="Ps32_11"></a><B><a href="/psalms/32-11.html">32:11</a></B> Be glad in the LORD, and <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for joy, all [ye that are] upright in heart. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) He shows that peace and joy of conscience in the Holy Spirit is the fruit of faith. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
