And Amnon said, Have out all men from <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> me. And they went out every man from him. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) That is, she served them on a dish. <BR>(<span>f</span>) For the wicked are ashamed to do that before men, which they are not afraid to commit in the sight of God. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Sa13_9"</a><a name="2Sa13_10"</a><a name="2Sa13_11"</a><a name="2Sa13_12"</a><B><a href="/2-samuel/13-13.html">13:13</a></B> And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee, thou shalt be as one of <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) As a lewd and wicked person. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Sa13_13"</a><a name="2Sa13_14"</a><a name="2Sa13_15"</a><a name="2Sa13_16"</a><a name="2Sa13_17"</a><B><a href="/2-samuel/13-18.html">13:18</a></B> And [she had] a garment of <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> divers colours upon her: for with such robes were the kings daughters [that were] virgins apparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) For that which was of various colours or pieces, in those days was greatly esteemed, ( <a href="/genesis/37-3.html">Genesis 37:3</a> ;  <a href="/judges/5-30.html">Judges 5:30</a> ). </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Sa13_18"</a><a name="2Sa13_19"</a><B><a href="/2-samuel/13-20.html">13:20</a></B> And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> hold now thy peace, my sister: he [is] thy brother; regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absaloms house. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) For though he conceived sudden vengeance in his heart, yet he concealed it till an opportunity arose, and comforted his sister. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Sa13_20"</a><a name="2Sa13_21"</a><a name="2Sa13_22"</a><B><a href="/2-samuel/13-23.html">13:23</a></B> And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baalhazor, which [is] beside Ephraim: and <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> Absalom invited all the kings sons. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) That is, to a banquet, thinking by it to fulfil his wicked purpose. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Sa13_23"</a><a name="2Sa13_24"</a><a name="2Sa13_25"</a><B><a href="/2-samuel/13-26.html">13:26</a></B> Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> Amnon go with us.
