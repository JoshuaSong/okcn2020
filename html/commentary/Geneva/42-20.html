<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) Craftiness is a certain diligence and subtle knowledge to do evil, which is achieved by much use and great practise in matters. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu20_24"></a><a name="Lu20_25"></a><a name="Lu20_26"></a><a name="Lu20_27"></a><B><a href="/luke/20-27.html">20:27</a></B> <SUP><span>4</span></SUP> Then came to [him] certain of the Sadducees, which deny that there is any resurrection; and they asked him, <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>4</span>) The resurrection of the flesh is affirmed against the Sadducees. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu20_28"></a><a name="Lu20_29"></a><a name="Lu20_30"></a><a name="Lu20_31"></a><a name="Lu20_32"></a><a name="Lu20_33"></a><a name="Lu20_34"></a><B><a href="/luke/20-34.html">20:34</a></B> And Jesus answering said unto them, The <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> children of this world marry, and are given in marriage: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>g</span>) "The children of this world" refers here to those who live in this world, and not those that are wholly given to the world (and therefore contrary to the children of light), as above in ( <a href="/luke/16-8.html">Luke 16:8</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu20_35"></a><a name="Lu20_36"></a><B><a href="/luke/20-36.html">20:36</a></B> Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> children of the resurrection. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) That is, men who partake in the resurrection: for as we truly say that they will indeed live who will enjoy everlasting bliss, so do those indeed rise who rise to life; though if this word "resurrection" is taken generally, it refers also to the wicked, who will rise to condemnation, which is not properly life, but death. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu20_37"></a><a name="Lu20_38"></a><B><a href="/luke/20-38.html">20:38</a></B> For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> live unto him. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) That is, before him: a saying to take note of, for the godly do not die, though they die here on earth. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu20_39"></a><a name="Lu20_40"></a><a name="Lu20_41"></a><B><a href="/luke/20-41.html">20:41</a></B> <SUP><span>5</span></SUP> And he said unto them, How say they that Christ is Davids son? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>5</span>) Even though Christ is the son of David according to the flesh he is also his Lord (because he is the everlasting Son of God) according to the spirit. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu20_42"></a><a name="Lu20_43"></a><a name="Lu20_44"></a><a name="Lu20_45"></a><a name="Lu20_46"></a><B><a href="/luke/20-46.html">20:46</a></B> <SUP><span>6</span></SUP> Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts; <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>6</span>) We must avoid the example of the glory-seeking and covetous pastors. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu20_47"></a><B><a href="/luke/20-47.html">20:47</a></B> Which devour widows <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> houses, and for a shew make long prayers: the same shall receive greater damnation. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) By the figure of speech metonymy, "houses" is understood to mean the goods and substance. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
