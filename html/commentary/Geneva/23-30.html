and that <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> cover with a covering, but not of my spirit, that they may add sin to sin: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>a</span>) Who contrary to their promise take not me for their protector and contrary to my commandment seek help from strangers. <BR>(<span>b</span>) They seek shifts to cloak their doings and not godly means. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa30_2"></a><a name="Isa30_3"></a><a name="Isa30_4"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/30-4.html">30:4</a></B> For his <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> princes were at Zoan, and his ambassadors came to Hanes. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) The chief of Israel went into Egypt as an ambassador to seek help and abode at these cities. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa30_5"></a><a name="Isa30_6"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/30-6.html">30:6</a></B> The <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> burden of the beasts of the south: into the land of trouble and anguish, from which [come] the young and the old lion, the viper and flying serpent, they will carry their riches upon the shoulders of young donkeys, and their treasures upon the humps of camels, to a people [that] shall not profit [them]. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) That is, a heavy sentence or prophecy against the beasts that carried their treasures into Egypt, by the wilderness, which was south from Judah, signifying that if the beasts would not be spared, the men would be punished much more grievously. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa30_7"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/30-7.html">30:7</a></B> For the Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no purpose: therefore have I cried <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> concerning this, Their strength <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> [is] to sit still. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) That is, to Jerusalem. <BR>(<span>f</span>) And not to come to and fro to seek help. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa30_8"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/30-8.html">30:8</a></B> Now go, write <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> it before them in a tablet, and note it in a book, that it may be for the <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> time to come for ever and ever: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) That is, this prophecy. <BR>(<span>h</span>) That is may be a witness against them for all posterity. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa30_9"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/30-9.html">30:9</a></B> That this [is] a rebellious people, lying children, children [that] will not <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> hear the law of the LORD: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) He shows what was the cause of their destruction and brings also all misery to man: that is, because they would not hear the word of God, but delighted to be flattered and led in error. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa30_10"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/30-10.html">30:10</a></B> Who say to the seers, See not;
