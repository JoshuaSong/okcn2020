And when he had spoken unto me, I <SUP><span>o</span></SUP> was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>n</span>) He declares by this that God would be merciful to the people of Israel. <BR>(<span>o</span>) Which declares that when God smites his children down, he does not immediately lift them up at once (for now the Angel had touched him twice), but by little and little. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Da10_20"></a><B><a href="/daniel/10-20.html">10:20</a></B> Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I am gone forth, lo, the <SUP><span>p</span></SUP> prince of Grecia shall come. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>p</span>) Meaning that he would not only himself bridle the rage of Cambyses, but also the other kings of Persia by Alexander the King of Macedonia. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Da10_21"></a><B><a href="/daniel/10-21.html">10:21</a></B> But I will shew thee that which is noted in the scripture of truth: <SUP><span>q</span></SUP> and [there is] none that holdeth with me in these things, but Michael your prince. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>q</span>) For this angel was appointed for the defence of the Church under Christ, who is the head of it. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
