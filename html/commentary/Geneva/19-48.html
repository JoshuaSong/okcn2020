Great [is] the LORD, and greatly to be praised in the <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> city of our God, [in] the mountain of his holiness. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>a</span>) Some put this difference between a song and psalm, saying that it is called a song when there is no instrument but the voice, and the song of the psalm is when the instruments begin and the voice follows. <BR>(<span>b</span>) Even though God shows his wonders through all the world, yet he will be chiefly praised in his Church. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps48_2"></a><B><a href="/psalms/48-2.html">48:2</a></B> Beautiful for situation, the <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> joy of the whole earth, [is] mount Zion, [on] the sides of the north, the city of the great King. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) Because the word of salvation came there to all who would believe. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps48_3"></a><B><a href="/psalms/48-3.html">48:3</a></B> God is known in her palaces for a <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> refuge. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) Unless God is the defence of it, neither situation nor munition can prevail. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps48_4"></a><B><a href="/psalms/48-4.html">48:4</a></B> For, lo, the kings were <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> assembled, they passed by together. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) They conspired and went against Gods people. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps48_5"></a><B><a href="/psalms/48-5.html">48:5</a></B> They saw [<SUP><span>f</span></SUP> it, and] so they marvelled; they were troubled, [and] hasted away. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) The enemies were afraid at the sight of the city. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps48_6"></a><a name="Ps48_7"></a><B><a href="/psalms/48-7.html">48:7</a></B> Thou breakest the ships <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> of Tarshish with an east wind. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) That is, of Cilicia or of the Mediterranean sea. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ps48_8"></a><B><a href="/psalms/48-8.html">48:8</a></B> As we have <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever.
