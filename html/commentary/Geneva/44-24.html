see Josephus in the History of the Jewish War, lib. 2, cap. 11. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ac24_11"></a><a name="Ac24_12"></a><a name="Ac24_13"></a><B><a href="/acts/24-13.html">24:13</a></B> Neither can they <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> prove the things whereof they now accuse me. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) They cannot lay forth before you and prove with good reasons. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ac24_14"></a><B><a href="/acts/24-14.html">24:14</a></B> <SUP><span>3</span></SUP> But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>3</span>) Paul proceeds in the case of religion from a conjectural state to a practical state, not only admitting of the religion which he was accused of, but also proving it to be true, to be heavenly and from God, and to be the oldest of all religions. <BR>(<span>i</span>) Here this word "heresy" or "sect" is taken in a good sense. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ac24_15"></a><a name="Ac24_16"></a><a name="Ac24_17"></a><B><a href="/acts/24-17.html">24:17</a></B> <SUP><span>4</span></SUP> Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>4</span>) Paul in conclusion tells the things thing which was truly done, which Tertullus before him had corrupted in various ways. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ac24_18"></a><B><a href="/acts/24-18.html">24:18</a></B> <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> Whereupon certain Jews from <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) And while I was occupied with those things. <BR>(<span>l</span>) By this it is evident that these from Asia were Pauls enemies, and the ones that stirred up the people against him. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ac24_19"></a><a name="Ac24_20"></a><B><a href="/acts/24-20.html">24:20</a></B> Or else let these same [here] say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the <SUP><span>m</span></SUP> council, <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>m</span>) Where the tribune brought me. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ac24_21"></a><a name="Ac24_22"></a><B><a href="/acts/24-22.html">24:22</a></B> <SUP><span>5</span></SUP> And when Felix heard these things, having more <SUP><span>n</span></SUP> perfect knowledge of [that] way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>5</span>) The judge suspends his sentence because the matter is doubtful. <BR>(<span>n</span>) Felix could not judge whether he had done wickedly in the matter of his religion or not until he had a better understanding of the way which Paul professed: and as for other matters with regard to the charge of sedition, he considers it good to defer it until he hears Lysias, and therefore he gives Paul somewhat more liberty. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ac24_23"></a><B><a href="/acts/24-23.html">24:23</a></B> <SUP><span>6</span></SUP> And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let [him] have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>6</span>) God is a most faithful keeper of his servants, and the power of the truth is wonderful, even amongst men who are otherwise profane. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ac24_24"></a><B><a href="/acts/24-24.html">24:24</a></B> And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife <SUP><span>o</span></SUP> Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>o</span>) This Drusilla was Agrippas sister of whom Luke speaks afterwards, a harlot and very licentious woman, and being the wife of Azizus king of the Emesens, who was circumcised, departed from him, and went to this Felix the brother of Pallas, who was at one time the slave of Nero. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ac24_25"></a><a name="Ac24_26"></a><a name="Ac24_27"></a><B><a href="/acts/24-27.html">24:27</a></B> <SUP><span>7</span></SUP> But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix room: and Felix, willing to <SUP><span>p</span></SUP> shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>7</span>) With an evil mind, that is guilty in itself, and although sometimes there is some show of fairness, yet eventually the conscience will be extinguished: but in the meanwhile we have need of continual patience. <BR>(<span>p</span>) For he had behaved himself very wickedly in the province, and had it not been for favour of his brother Pallas, he would have died for it: so that we may gather by this why he would have pleased the Jews. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
