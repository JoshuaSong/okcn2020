Some read, "You intend some mischief". <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ex10_11"></a><a name="Ex10_12"></a><a name="Ex10_13"></a><a name="Ex10_14"></a><a name="Ex10_15"></a><a name="Ex10_16"></a><B><a href="/exodus/10-16.html">10:16</a></B> Then Pharaoh called for <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) The wicked in their misery seek Gods ministers for help, even though they hate and detest them. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ex10_17"></a><a name="Ex10_18"></a><a name="Ex10_19"></a><B><a href="/exodus/10-19.html">10:19</a></B> And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the locusts, and cast them into the <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> Red sea; there remained not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) The water seemed red, because the sand or gravel is red: the Hebrews call it the Sea of bulrushes. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ex10_20"></a><a name="Ex10_21"></a><B><a href="/exodus/10-21.html">10:21</a></B> And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness [which] may be <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> felt. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) Because it was so thick. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ex10_22"></a><a name="Ex10_23"></a><a name="Ex10_24"></a><a name="Ex10_25"></a><a name="Ex10_26"></a><B><a href="/exodus/10-26.html">10:26</a></B> Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> hoof be left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our God; and we know not <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) The ministers of God should not yield one iota to the wicked, in regards to their mission. <BR>(<span>k</span>) That is, with what beasts, or how many. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ex10_27"></a><a name="Ex10_28"></a><B><a href="/exodus/10-28.html">10:28</a></B> And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in [that] day thou seest my face thou shalt <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> die. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>l</span>) Though earlier he admitted Moses was just, yet again in his own heart he threatened to put him to death. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
