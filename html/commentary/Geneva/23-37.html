<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) Which was a city of the Medes. <BR>(<span>k</span>) Called also Charre a city in Mesopotamia, from which Abraham came after his fathers death. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa37_13"></a><a name="Isa37_14"></a><a name="Isa37_15"></a><a name="Isa37_16"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/37-16.html">37:16</a></B> O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, that <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> dwellest [between] the cherubim, thou [art] the God, [even] thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth: thou hast made heaven and earth. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>l</span>) He grounds his prayer on Gods promise, who promised to hear them from between the Cherubims. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa37_17"></a><a name="Isa37_18"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/37-18.html">37:18</a></B> Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations, and <SUP><span>m</span></SUP> their countries, <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>m</span>) Meaning, the ten tribes. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa37_19"></a><a name="Isa37_20"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/37-20.html">37:20</a></B> Now therefore, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, that <SUP><span>n</span></SUP> all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou [art] the LORD, [even] thou only. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>n</span>) He declares for what cause he prayed, that they might be glorified by it through all the world. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa37_21"></a><a name="Isa37_22"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/37-22.html">37:22</a></B> This [is] the word which the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The <SUP><span>o</span></SUP> virgin, the daughter of Zion, hath despised, [and] derided thee; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>o</span>) Whom God had chosen to himself as a chaste virgin, and over whom he had care to preserve her from the lusts of the tyrant, as a father would have over his daughter. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa37_23"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/37-23.html">37:23</a></B> Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted [thy] voice, and lifted thy eyes on high? [even] against the <SUP><span>p</span></SUP> Holy One of Israel. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>p</span>) Declaring by this that they who are enemies to Gods Church fight against him whose quarrel his Church only maintains. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa37_24"></a><a name="Isa37_25"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/37-25.html">37:25</a></B> I have dug, <SUP><span>q</span></SUP> and drank water; and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of the besieged places. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>q</span>) He boasts of his policy in that he can find means to nourish his army: and of his power in that his army is so great, that it is able to dry up whole rivers, and to destroy the waters which the Jews had closed in. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa37_26"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/37-26.html">37:26</a></B> Hast thou not heard long ago, [how] I have done it; [and] of ancient times, <SUP><span>r</span></SUP> that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste fortified cities [into] ruinous heaps. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>r</span>) Signifying that God did not make his Church to destroy it, but to preserve it: and therefore he says that he formed it of old, even in his eternal counsel which cannot be changed. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa37_27"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/37-27.html">37:27</a></B> Therefore their inhabitants [were] of small power, they were dismayed and confounded: they were [as] the grass of the field, and [as] the green herb, [as] the grass on the housetops, and [as grain] blighted <SUP><span>s</span></SUP> before it is grown up. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>s</span>) He shows that the state and power of most flourishing cities endures but a moment in respect to the Church, which will remain forever, because God is the maintainer of it. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa37_28"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/37-28.html">37:28</a></B> But I know thy abode, and thy <SUP><span>t</span></SUP> going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>t</span>) Meaning, his counsels and enterprises. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa37_29"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/37-29.html">37:29</a></B> Because thy rage against me, and thy tumult, is come up into my ears, therefore I will put my <SUP><span>u</span></SUP> hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou <SUP><span>x</span></SUP> camest. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>u</span>) Because Sennacherib showed himself as a devouring fish and furious beast, he uses these similarities to teach how he will take him and guide him. <BR>(<span>x</span>) You will lose your labour. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa37_30"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/37-30.html">37:30</a></B> And this [shall be] a <SUP><span>y</span></SUP> sign to thee, Ye shall eat <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>[this] year such as groweth of itself; and the (<span>z</span>) second year that which springeth of the same: and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them. <BR>(<span>y</span>) God gives signs after two sorts: some go before the thing as the signs that Moses worked in Egypt, which were for the confirmation of their faith, and some go after the thing, as the sacrifice, which they were commanded to make three days after their departure: and these latter are to keep the blessings of God in our remembrance, of which sort this here is. <BR>(<span>z</span>) He promises that for two years the ground would feed them of itself. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa37_31"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/37-31.html">37:31</a></B> And <SUP><span>a</span></SUP> the remnant that hath escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>a</span>) They whom God has delivered out of the hands of the Assyrians will prosper: and this properly belongs to the Church. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa37_32"></a><a name="Isa37_33"></a><a name="Isa37_34"></a><a name="Isa37_35"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/37-35.html">37:35</a></B> For I will defend this city to save it for my own sake, and for my servant <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> Davids sake. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>b</span>) For my promise sake made to David. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa37_36"></a><a name="Isa37_37"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/37-37.html">37:37</a></B> So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> Nineveh. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) Which was the chiefest city of the Assyrians. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa37_38"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/37-38.html">37:38</a></B> And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Armenia: and <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) Who was also called Sardanapalus, in whose days ten years after Sennacheribs death the Chaldeans overcame the Assyrians by Merodach their king. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
