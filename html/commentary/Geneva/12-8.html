And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this [is] the woman, and this [is] her son, whom Elisha restored to life. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) Gods wonderful providence appears in this, that he caused the king to desire to hear him, whom before he contemned and also hereby prepared an entrance to the poor widows suit. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki8_5"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/8-6.html">8:6</a></B> And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed unto her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that [was] hers, and all the <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> fruits of the field since the day that she left the land, even until now. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) The king caused that to be justly restored which was wrongfully withheld from her. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki8_6"</a><a name="2Ki8_7"</a><a name="2Ki8_8"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/8-9.html">8:9</a></B> So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> good thing of Damascus, forty camels burden, and came and stood before him, and said, Thy son Benhadad king of Syria hath sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover of this disease? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) Of all the chiefest and precious things of the country. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki8_9"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/8-10.html">8:10</a></B> And Elisha said unto him, Go, say unto him, Thou mayest certainly <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> recover: howbeit the LORD hath shewed me that he shall surely die. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) Meaning that he would recover of this disease: but he knew that this messenger Hazael would slay him to obtain the kingdom. </BLOCKQUOTE><a name="2Ki8_10"</a><a name="2Ki8_11"</a><a name="2Ki8_12"</a><B><a href="/2-kings/8-13.html">8:13</a></B> And Hazael said, But what, [is] thy servant <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> a dog, that he should do this great thing?
