Joseph, [being] seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad [was] with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his fathers wives: and Joseph brought unto his father their evil <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> report. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>b</span>) He complained of the evil words and injuries which they spoke and did to him. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge37_3"></a><a name="Ge37_4"></a><a name="Ge37_5"></a><B><a href="/genesis/37-5.html">37:5</a></B> And Joseph <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> dreamed a dream, and he told [it] his brethren: and they hated him yet the more. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) God revealed to him by a dream what should come to pass. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge37_6"></a><a name="Ge37_7"></a><a name="Ge37_8"></a><B><a href="/genesis/37-8.html">37:8</a></B> And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) The more God shows himself favourable to his own, the more the malice of the wicked rages against them. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge37_9"></a><a name="Ge37_10"></a><B><a href="/genesis/37-10.html">37:10</a></B> And he told [it] to his father, and to his brethren: and his father <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> rebuked him, and said unto him, What [is] this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) Not despising the vision, but seeking to appease his brethren. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge37_11"></a><B><a href="/genesis/37-11.html">37:11</a></B> And his brethren envied him; but his father <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> observed the saying. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) He knew that God was the author of the dream, but he did not understand the meaning. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge37_12"></a><a name="Ge37_13"></a><a name="Ge37_14"></a><a name="Ge37_15"></a><a name="Ge37_16"></a><a name="Ge37_17"></a><a name="Ge37_18"></a><B><a href="/genesis/37-18.html">37:18</a></B> And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>unto them, they (<span>g</span>) conspired against him to slay him. <BR>(<span>g</span>) The Holy Spirit does not cover the faults of men, as vain writers do, who make virtues out of vices. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge37_19"></a><a name="Ge37_20"></a><a name="Ge37_21"></a><a name="Ge37_22"></a><a name="Ge37_23"></a><a name="Ge37_24"></a><B><a href="/genesis/37-24.html">37:24</a></B> And they took him, and cast <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> him into a pit: and the pit [was] empty, [there was] no water in it. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) Their hypocrisy appears in this that they feared man more than God: and thought it was not murder, if they did not shed his blood or had excuses to cover their fault. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge37_25"></a><a name="Ge37_26"></a><a name="Ge37_27"></a><a name="Ge37_28"></a><B><a href="/genesis/37-28.html">37:28</a></B> Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> Ishmeelites for twenty [pieces] of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>i</span>) Moses writes according to the opinion of those who took the Midianites and Ishmaelites to be one, and here mixes their names: as also appears in ( <a href="/genesis/37-36.html">Genesis 37:36</a>  <a href="/genesis/39-1.html">Genesis 39:1</a> ) or else he was first offered to the Midianites, but sold to the Ishmaelites. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge37_29"></a><a name="Ge37_30"></a><a name="Ge37_31"></a><a name="Ge37_32"></a><B><a href="/genesis/37-32.html">37:32</a></B> And they sent the coat of [many] colours, <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> and they brought [it] to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it [be] thy sons coat or no. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) That is, the messengers who were sent. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Ge37_33"></a><a name="Ge37_34"></a><a name="Ge37_35"></a><a name="Ge37_36"></a><B><a href="/genesis/37-36.html">37:36</a></B> And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> officer of Pharaohs, [and] captain of the guard. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>l</span>) Or "eunuch", which does not always signify a man that is gelded, but also someone that is in some high position. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
