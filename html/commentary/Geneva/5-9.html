( <a href="/numbers/13-26.html">Numbers 13:26</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="De9_3"></a><B><a href="/deuteronomy/9-3.html">9:3</a></B> Understand therefore this day, that the LORD thy God [is] he which <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> goeth over before thee; [as] a consuming fire he shall destroy them, and he shall bring them down before thy face: so shalt thou drive them out, and destroy them quickly, as the LORD hath said unto thee. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) To guide you and govern you. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="De9_4"></a><B><a href="/deuteronomy/9-4.html">9:4</a></B> Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the LORD thy God hath cast them out from before thee, saying, For my <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> righteousness the LORD hath brought me in to possess this land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD doth drive them out from before thee. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) Man by himself deserves nothing but Gods anger, and if God spares anyone it comes from his great mercy. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="De9_5"></a><a name="De9_6"></a><B><a href="/deuteronomy/9-6.html">9:6</a></B> Understand therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou [art] a <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> stiffnecked people. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) Like stubborn oxen who will not endure their masters yoke. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="De9_7"></a><B><a href="/deuteronomy/9-7.html">9:7</a></B> Remember, [and] forget not, how thou provokedst the LORD thy God to wrath in the wilderness: <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> from the day that thou didst depart out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious against the LORD. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) He proves by the length of time, that their rebellion was great and intolerable. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="De9_8"></a><a name="De9_9"></a><a name="De9_10"></a><B><a href="/deuteronomy/9-10.html">9:10</a></B> And the LORD delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> finger of God; and on them [was written] according to all the words, which the LORD spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) That is, miraculously, and not by the hand of men. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="De9_11"></a><a name="De9_12"></a><B><a href="/deuteronomy/9-12.html">9:12</a></B> And the LORD said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> corrupted [themselves]; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>h</span>) As soon as man declines from the obedience of God, his ways are corrupt. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="De9_13"></a><a name="De9_14"></a><B><a href="/deuteronomy/9-14.html">9:14</a></B> <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) Demonstrating that the prayers of the faithful are a bar to restrain Gods anger so that he does not consume all. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="De9_15"></a><a name="De9_16"></a><B><a href="/deuteronomy/9-16.html">9:16</a></B> And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the LORD your God, [and] had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out of the <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> way which the LORD had commanded you. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) That is, from the Law: in which he declares what the cause of our punishment is. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="De9_17"></a><a name="De9_18"></a><a name="De9_19"></a><a name="De9_20"></a><B><a href="/deuteronomy/9-20.html">9:20</a></B> And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron also the same time. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>l</span>) By which he shows the danger they are in who have authority and do not resist wickedness. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="De9_21"></a><B><a href="/deuteronomy/9-21.html">9:21</a></B> And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, [and] ground [it] very small, [even] until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the <SUP><span>m</span></SUP> mount. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>m</span>) Horeb, or Sinai. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="De9_22"></a><a name="De9_23"></a><B><a href="/deuteronomy/9-23.html">9:23</a></B> Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadeshbarnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye <SUP><span>n</span></SUP> rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>n</span>) At the return of the spies. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="De9_24"></a><a name="De9_25"></a><B><a href="/deuteronomy/9-25.html">9:25</a></B> Thus I fell down before the LORD <SUP><span>o</span></SUP> forty days and forty nights, as I fell down [at the first]; because the LORD had said he would destroy you. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>o</span>) By which is signified that God requires earnest continuance in prayer. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="De9_26"></a><a name="De9_27"></a><B><a href="/deuteronomy/9-27.html">9:27</a></B> <SUP><span>p</span></SUP> Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>p</span>) The godly in their prayers ground on Gods promise, and confess their sins. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
