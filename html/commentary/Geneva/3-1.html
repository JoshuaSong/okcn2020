Therefore he ordained various kinds of duties and sacrifices, to assure them of forgiveness for their offences (if they offered them in true faith and obedience.) Also he appointed the priests and levites, their apparel, offices, conversation and portion; he showed what feasts they should observe, and when. Moreover, he declares by these sacrifices and ceremonies that the reward of sin is death, and that without the blood of Christ the innocent Lamb, there can be no forgiveness of sins. Because they should not give priority to their own inventions (which God detested, as appears by the terrible example of Nadab and Abihu) he prescribed even to the least things, what they should do, what beasts they should offer and eat, what diseases were contagious and to be avoided, how they should purge all types of filthiness and pollution, whose company they should flee, what marriages were lawful, and what customs were profitable. After declaring these things, he promised favour and blessing to those who keep his laws, and threatened his curse to those who transgressed them. <BR>(<span>a</span>) By this Moses declares that he taught nothing to the people but that which he received from God. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Le1_2"></a><B><a href="/leviticus/1-2.html">1:2</a></B> Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man of you bring an offering unto the LORD, ye shall bring your offering of the <SUP><span>b</span></SUP> cattle, [even] of the herd, and of the flock. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>b</span>) So they could offer of no other sort, but of those who were commanded. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Le1_3"></a><B><a href="/leviticus/1-3.html">1:3</a></B> If his offering [be] a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) Meaning, within the court of the tabernacle. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Le1_4"></a><a name="Le1_5"></a><B><a href="/leviticus/1-5.html">1:5</a></B> And <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the priests, Aarons sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about upon the <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> altar that [is by] the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) A priest of the Levites. <BR>(<span>e</span>) Of the burnt offering, ( <a href="/exodus/27-1.html">Exodus 27:1</a> ). <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Le1_6"></a><a name="Le1_7"></a><a name="Le1_8"></a><a name="Le1_9"></a><B><a href="/leviticus/1-9.html">1:9</a></B> But his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water: and the priest shall burn all on the altar, [to be] a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> unto the LORD. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) Or a savour of rest, which pacifies the anger of the Lord. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Le1_10"></a><a name="Le1_11"></a><B><a href="/leviticus/1-11.html">1:11</a></B> <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward <SUP><span>h</span></SUP> before the LORD: and the priests, Aarons sons, shall sprinkle his blood round about upon the altar. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>g</span>) Read ( <a href="/leviticus/1-5.html">Leviticus 1:5</a> ). <BR>(<span>h</span>) Before the altar of the Lord. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Le1_12"></a><a name="Le1_13"></a><a name="Le1_14"></a><a name="Le1_15"></a><B><a href="/leviticus/1-15.html">1:15</a></B> And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and <SUP><span>i</span></SUP> wring off his head, and burn [it] on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be wrung out at the side of the altar: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>i</span>) The Hebrew word signifies to pinch off with the nail. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Le1_16"></a><B><a href="/leviticus/1-16.html">1:16</a></B> And he shall pluck away his crop with his feathers, and cast it beside the altar on the <SUP><span>k</span></SUP> east part, by the place of the ashes: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE><BR>(<span>k</span>) On the side of the court gate in the pans which stood with ashes; ( <a href="/exodus/27-3.html">Exodus 27:3</a> ). <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
