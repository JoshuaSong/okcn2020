O my people, they who lead thee cause [thee] to err, and destroy the way of thy paths. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>k</span>) Because the wicked people were more addicted to their princes than to the commandments of God, he shows that he would give them such princes, by whom they would have no help, but that they would be manifest tokens of his wrath, because they would be fools and effeminate. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa3_13"></a><a name="Isa3_14"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/3-14.html">3:14</a></B> The LORD will enter into judgment with the <SUP><span>l</span></SUP> elders of his people, and with their princes: for ye have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor [is] in your houses. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>l</span>) Meaning that the rulers and governors had destroyed his Church and not preserved it, according to their duty. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa3_15"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/3-15.html">3:15</a></B> What mean ye [that] ye beat my people to pieces, <SUP><span>m</span></SUP> and grind the faces of the poor? saith the Lord GOD of hosts. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>m</span>) That is, you show all cruelty against them. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa3_16"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/3-16.html">3:16</a></B> Moreover the LORD saith, <SUP><span>n</span></SUP> Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with <SUP><span>o</span></SUP> extended necks and <SUP><span>p</span></SUP> wanton eyes, walking and <SUP><span>q</span></SUP> mincing [as] they go, and making a <SUP><span>r</span></SUP> tinkling with their feet: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>n</span>) He means the people because of the arrogancy and pride of their women who gave themselves to all wantonness and dissolution. <BR>(<span>o</span>) Which declared their pride. <BR>(<span>p</span>) As a sign that they were not chaste. <BR>(<span>q</span>) Which showed their wantonness. <BR>(<span>r</span>) They delighted then in slippers that creaked or had little plates sewn on them which tinkled as they went. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa3_17"></a><a name="Isa3_18"></a><a name="Isa3_19"></a><a name="Isa3_20"></a><a name="Isa3_21"></a><a name="Isa3_22"></a><a name="Isa3_23"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/3-23.html">3:23</a></B> The mirrors, and the fine linen, and the turbans, and the <SUP><span>s</span></SUP> veils. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>s</span>) In rehearsing all these things particularly he shows the lightness and vanity of such as cannot be content with comely apparel according to their degree. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Isa3_24"></a><a name="Isa3_25"></a><B><a href="/isaiah/3-25.html">3:25</a></B> Thy men shall fall by the <SUP><span>t</span></SUP> sword, and thy mighty in the war. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>t</span>) Meaning that God will not only punish the women but their husbands who have permitted this dissoluteness and also the commonwealth which has not remedied it. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
