A reed shaken with the wind? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>4</span>) That which the prophets showed long before, John shows presently: and Christ himself presents it daily unto us in the gospel, but for the most part in vain, because many seek nothing else than foolish toys and vain glory. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu7_25"></a><a name="Lu7_26"></a><a name="Lu7_27"></a><a name="Lu7_28"></a><a name="Lu7_29"></a><B><a href="/luke/7-29.html">7:29</a></B> And all the people that heard [him], and the publicans, <SUP><span>c</span></SUP> justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>c</span>) Said that he was just, good, faithful and merciful. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu7_30"></a><B><a href="/luke/7-30.html">7:30</a></B> But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God <SUP><span>d</span></SUP> against themselves, being not baptized of him. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) To their own hurt. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu7_31"></a><B><a href="/luke/7-31.html">7:31</a></B> <SUP><span>5</span></SUP> And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like? <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>5</span>) Whatever manner God uses in offering us the gospel, most men bring offences upon themselves: yet nevertheless a Church is gathered together. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu7_32"></a><a name="Lu7_33"></a><a name="Lu7_34"></a><a name="Lu7_35"></a><a name="Lu7_36"></a><B><a href="/luke/7-36.html">7:36</a></B> <SUP><span>6</span></SUP> And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisees house, and sat down to meat. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>6</span>) Proud men deprive themselves of the benefits of the presence of Christ, even when he is at home with them in their houses; and these benefits the humble and base enjoy. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu7_37"></a><a name="Lu7_38"></a><a name="Lu7_39"></a><B><a href="/luke/7-39.html">7:39</a></B> <SUP><span>7</span></SUP> Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw [it], he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman [this is] that toucheth him: <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> for she is a sinner. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>7</span>) Rashness is the companion of pride. <BR>(<span>e</span>) The Pharisee respects the law, which holds that those who touch the defiled are defiled. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu7_40"></a><B><a href="/luke/7-40.html">7:40</a></B> <SUP><span>8</span></SUP> And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>8</span>) To love Christ is a sure and perpetual witness of the remission of sins. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu7_41"></a><a name="Lu7_42"></a><a name="Lu7_43"></a><a name="Lu7_44"></a><a name="Lu7_45"></a><a name="Lu7_46"></a><a name="Lu7_47"></a><B><a href="/luke/7-47.html">7:47</a></B> Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, [the same] loveth little. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) That is, says Theophylact, she has shown her faith abundantly: and Basil in his "Sermon of Baptism" says, "He that owes much has much forgiven him, that he may love much more". And therefore Christs saying is so plain in light of this that it is a wonder to see the enemies of the truth so badly distort and misinterpret this place in such a thorough manner in order to establish their meritorious works: for the greater sum a man has forgiven him, the more he loves him that has been so gracious to him. And this woman shows by deeds of love how great the benefit was she had received: and therefore the charity that is here spoken of is not to be taken as the cause of her forgiveness, but as a sign of it: for Christ does not say as the Pharisees did that she was a sinner, but bears her witness that the sins of her past life are forgiven her. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu7_48"></a><a name="Lu7_49"></a><a name="Lu7_50"></a><B><a href="/luke/7-50.html">7:50</a></B> And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; <SUP><span>g</span></SUP> go in peace. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>g</span>) He confirms with a blessing the benefit which he had bestowed. <BR></span><P>&nbsp;<!--pageCount=1-->
