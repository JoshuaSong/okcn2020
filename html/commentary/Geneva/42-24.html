<BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>d</span>) Some of the old fathers think that the other disciple was the same evangelist who wrote this book, but Epiphanius, writing against the Saturnilians, says it was Nathanael; but none of these are certainties. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu24_19"></a><a name="Lu24_20"></a><B><a href="/luke/24-20.html">24:20</a></B> <SUP><span>5</span></SUP> And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>5</span>) It appears by conferring the prophecies of the prophets that all those things are true and certain which the evangelist have put down in writing about Christ. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu24_21"></a><a name="Lu24_22"></a><a name="Lu24_23"></a><a name="Lu24_24"></a><a name="Lu24_25"></a><a name="Lu24_26"></a><a name="Lu24_27"></a><a name="Lu24_28"></a><a name="Lu24_29"></a><a name="Lu24_30"></a><a name="Lu24_31"></a><B><a href="/luke/24-31.html">24:31</a></B> And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he <SUP><span>e</span></SUP> vanished out of their sight. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>e</span>) Suddenly taken away, and we may not therefore imagine that he was there in an invisible body, but indeed believe that he suddenly changed the place where he was. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu24_32"></a><a name="Lu24_33"></a><a name="Lu24_34"></a><a name="Lu24_35"></a><B><a href="/luke/24-35.html">24:35</a></B> And they told what things [were done] in the way, and how he was known of them in <SUP><span>f</span></SUP> breaking of bread. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>f</span>) When he broke bread, which that people used to do, and as the Jews still do today at the beginning of their meals and say a prayer. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu24_36"></a><B><a href="/luke/24-36.html">24:36</a></B> <SUP><span>6</span></SUP> And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace [be] unto you. <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>(<span>6</span>) The Lord himself shows by certain and necessary signs that he was risen again, and risen in the same body which he had taken upon himself. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE><a name="Lu24_37"></a><a name="Lu24_38"></a><B><a href="/luke/24-38.html">24:38</a></B> And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled?
