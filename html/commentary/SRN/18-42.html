		<span><B>Chapter 42</B></span><P><a href="/job/42-6.html"><B>42&#058;6</B></a>&nbsp; Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><P><B><span>Wherefore I abhor myself</span></B> <P>The problem, of which the book of Job is the profound discussion, finds here its solution. Brought into the presence of God, Job is revealed to himself. In no sense a hypocrite, but godly and possessing a faith which all his afflictions could not shake, Job was yet self-righteous and lacking in humility. Chapter 29 fully discloses this. But in the presence of God he anticipates, as it were, the experience of Paul.  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Philippians+3:4-9">Philippians 3:4-9</a>  and the problem is solved. The godly are afflicted that they may be brought to self-knowledge and self-judgment. Such afflictions are not penal for their sins, but remedial and purifying. The book of Job affords a sublime illustration of the truth announced in ;  <a href="/1-corinthians/11-31.html">1 Corinthians 11:31</a>  <a href="/1-corinthians/11-32.html">1 Corinthians 11:32</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Hebrews+12:7-11">Hebrews 12:7-11</a> . Best of all, such self-knowledge and self-judgment is the prelude to greater fruitfulness. ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Job+42:7-17">Job 42:7-17</a> ;  <a href="/john/15-2.html">John 15:2</a> .
