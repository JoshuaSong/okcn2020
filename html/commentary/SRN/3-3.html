		<span><B>Chapter 3</B></span><P><a href="/leviticus/3-1.html"><B>3&#058;1</B></a>&nbsp; And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offering, if he offer it of the herd; whether it be a male or female, he shall offer it without blemish before the LORD. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>peace-offering</span></B> <P>The peace-offering. The whole work of Christ in relation to the believer's peace is here in type. He made peace,  <a href="/colossians/1-20.html">Colossians 1:20</a>  proclaimed peace,  <a href="/ephesians/2-17.html">Ephesians 2:17</a>  and is our peace,  <a href="/ephesians/2-14.html">Ephesians 2:14</a> . <P>In Christ God and the sinner meet in peace; God is propitiated, the sinner reconciled-- both alike satisfied with what Christ has done. But all this at the cost of blood and fire. The details speak of fellowship. This brings in prominently the thought of fellowship with God through Christ. Hence the peace-offering is set forth as affording food for the priests  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Leviticus+7:31-34">Leviticus 7:31-34</a> . Observe that it is the breast (affections) and shoulders (strength) upon which we as priests  <a href="/1-peter/2-9.html">1&nbsp;Peter 2:9</a>  feed in fellowship with the Father. This it is which makes the peace-offering especially a thank-offering.  <a href="/leviticus/7-11.html">Leviticus 7:11</a>  <a href="/leviticus/7-12.html">Leviticus 7:12</a> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/leviticus/3-4.html"><B>3&#058;4</B></a>&nbsp; And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>caul</span></B> Fat appendage. <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><!--pageCount=1-->
