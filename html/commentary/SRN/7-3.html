The Heb. asherah, trans. grove means also the idol enshrined there.  <a href="/deuteronomy/16-21.html">Deuteronomy 16:21</a> . This idol seems often to have been a sacred tree, the figure of which is constantly found on Assyrian monuments. In apostate Israel, however, such groves were associated with every form of idolatry, e.g.  <a href="/2-kings/17-16.html">2 Kings 17:16</a>  <a href="/2-kings/17-17.html">2 Kings 17:17</a> . <P><I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/1-kings/1-kings-3.html#1Ki3_2">1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;3:2</a>")</I> and Ashtaroth See Scofield " <a href="/judges/2-13.html">Judges 2:13</a> ". <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><!--pageCount=1-->
