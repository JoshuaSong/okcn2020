These Gnostics "came most keenly into conflict with the exalted rank and redeeming rank of Christ, to whom they did not leave His full divine dignity, but assigned to Him merely the highest rank in the order of spirits, while they exalted angels as concerned in bringing the Messianic salvation."--H.A.W. Meyer. Paul's characteristic word in Colossians for the divine revelation is epignosis, i.e. "full knowledge."  <a href="/colossians/1-9.html">Colossians 1:9</a>  <a href="/colossians/1-10.html">Colossians 1:10</a> ;  <a href="/colossians/3-10.html"> 3:10</a>  as against the pretended "knowledge" of the errorists.
