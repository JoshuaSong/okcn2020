		<span><B>Chapter 1</B></span><P><a href="/nahum/1-1.html"><B>1&#058;1</B></a>&nbsp; The burden of Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>Nineveh</span></B> <P>Nineveh stands in Scripture as the representative of apostate religious Gentiledom, as Babylon represents the confusion into which the Gentile political world-system has fallen  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Daniel+2:41-43">Daniel 2:41-43,</a>  <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/isaiah/isaiah-13.html#Isa13_1">Isaiah&nbsp;13:1</a>")</I> , Under the preaching of Jonah, B.C. 862, the city and king had turned to God (Elohim),  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Jonah+3:3-10">Jonah 3:3-10</a>  But in the time of Nahum, more than a century later, the city had wholly apostatized from God. It is this which distinguishes Nineveh from all the other ancient Gentile cities, and which makes her the suited symbol of the present religious Gentile world-system in the last day. Morally, Nineveh is described in  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Romans+1:21-23">Romans 1:21-23</a> . The chief deity of apostate Nineveh was the bull-god, with the face of a man and the wings of a bird: "an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed beasts." <P>The message of Nahum, uttered about one hundred years before the destruction of Nineveh, is, therefore, not a call to repentance, but an unrelieved warning of judgment: "He will make an utter end: affliction shall not rise up the second time."  <a href="/nahum/1-9.html">Nahum 1:9</a> ; see, also,  <a href="/nahum/3-10.html">Nahum 3:10</a> . For there is no remedy for apostasy but utter judgment, and a new beginning. Cf. ;  <a href="/isaiah/1-4.html">Isaiah 1:4</a>  <a href="/isaiah/1-5.html">Isaiah 1:5</a>  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Isaiah+1:24-28">Isaiah 1:24-28</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Hebrews+6:4-8">Hebrews 6:4-8</a> ;  <a href="/proverbs/29-1.html">Proverbs 29:1</a> . <P>It is the way of God; apostasy is punished by catastrophic destruction. Of this the flood and the destruction of Nineveh are witnesses. The coming destruction of apostate Christendom is foreshadowed by these.

He can be "just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus"  <a href="/romans/3-26.html">Romans 3:26</a>  but only because His holy law has been vindicated in the cross. <P><P><P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/nahum/1-7.html"><B>1&#058;7</B></a>&nbsp; The LORD is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he knoweth them that trust in him. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>he knoweth them that trust</span></B>  <a href="/psalms/1-6.html">Psalms 1:6</a> ;  <a href="/2-timothy/2-19.html">2&nbsp;Timothy 2:19</a>  <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/psalms-1-75/psalms-2.html#ps2_12">Psalms&nbsp;2:12</a>")</I> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><!--pageCount=1-->
