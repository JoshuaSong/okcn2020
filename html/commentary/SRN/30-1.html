		<span><B>Chapter 1</B></span><P><a href="/amos/1-2.html"><B>1&#058;2</B></a>&nbsp; And he said, The LORD will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the habitations of the shepherds shall mourn, and the top of Carmel shall wither. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>roar</span></B> <P>"Roar," etc. Cf.  <a href="/isaiah/42-13.html">Isaiah 42:13</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Jeremiah+25:30-33">Jeremiah 25:30-33</a> ;  <a href="/hosea/11-10.html">Hosea 11:10</a>  <a href="/hosea/11-11.html">Hosea 11:11</a> ;  <a href="/joel/3-16.html">Joel 3:16</a> . It will be found that wherever the phrase occurs it is connected with the destruction of Gentile dominion (see "Times of the Gentiles,"  <a href="/luke/21-24.html">Luke 21:24</a> . <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/revelation/revelation-16.html#Re16_19">Revelation&nbsp;16:19</a>")</I> and the blessing of Israel in the kingdom. Without a doubt a near fulfilment upon Syria occurred  <a href="/2-kings/14-28.html">2&nbsp;Kings 14:28</a>  but the expression, "the Lord will roar," looks forward to a vaster fulfilment. See Scofield " <a href="/joel/1-4.html">Joel 1:4</a> ". <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><!--pageCount=1-->
