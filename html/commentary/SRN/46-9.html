		<span><B>Chapter 9</B></span><P><a href="/1-corinthians/9-5.html"><B>9&#058;5</B></a>&nbsp; Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas? <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>sister</span></B> <P>a wife who is a sister. <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/1-corinthians/9-11.html"><B>9&#058;11</B></a>&nbsp; If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things? <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>carnel</span></B> <P>i.e. things for the body. <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/1-corinthians/9-21.html"><B>9&#058;21</B></a>&nbsp; To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>without</span></B> <P>The expression is peculiar and might be literally rendered, " not lawless toward God, but inlawed to Christ." See "Law (of Christ),"  <a href="/galatians/6-2.html">Galatians 6:2</a> ;  <a href="/2-john/1-5.html">2&nbsp;John 1:5</a> . It is another way of saying, "not under the law, but under the rule of grace."  <a href="/romans/6-14.html">Romans 6:14</a> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/1-corinthians/9-22.html"><B>9&#058;22</B></a>&nbsp; To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>save</span></B> <P><I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/romans/romans-1.html#Ro1_16">Romans&nbsp;1:16</a>")</I> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/1-corinthians/9-24.html"><B>9&#058;24</B></a>&nbsp; Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>race</span></B> <P>race-course. <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/1-corinthians/9-27.html"><B>9&#058;27</B></a>&nbsp; But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>castaway</span></B> <P> (Greek - <a href="/lexicons/greek/kjv/adokimos.html"><span class="greek">Admivn</span></a> , "disapproved)." Dokimos, without the private a, is translated "approved" in  <a href="/romans/14-18.html">Romans 14:18</a> ;  <a href="/romans/16-10.html"> 16:10</a> ;  <a href="/1-corinthians/11-19.html">1&nbsp;Corinthians 11:19</a> ;  <a href="/2-corinthians/10-18.html">2&nbsp;Corinthians 10:18</a> ;  <a href="/2-timothy/2-15.html">2&nbsp;Timothy 2:15</a> ;  <a href="/james/1-12.html">James 1:12,</a>  by the word "tried." The prefix simply changes the word to a negative, i.e. not approved, or, disapproved. The apostle is writing of service, not of salvation. He is not expressing fear that he may fail of salvation but of his crown.
