It is by sowing seed, not by mingling leaven. The symbols have, in Scripture, a meaning fixed by inspired usage.

The kingdom of heaven is like a net which, cast into the sea of humanity, gathers of every kind, good and bad, and these remain together in the net (v. 49) and not merely in the sea, until the end of the age. It is not even a converted net, much less a converted sea. Infinite violence has been done to sound exegesis by the notion that the world is to be converted in this age. Against that notion stands our Lord's own interpretation of the parables of the Sower, the Wheat and Tares, and the Net. <P>Such, then, is the mystery form of the kingdom. <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/matthew/matthew-3.html#Mt3_2">Matthew&nbsp;3:2</a>")</I> .

It is defiled by formalism, doubt, and worldliness. But within it Christ sees the true children of the true kingdom who, at the end, are to "shine forth as the sun." In the great field, the world, He sees the redeemed of all ages, but especially His hidden Israel, yet to be restored and blessed, Also, in this form of the kingdom, so unlike that which is to be, He sees the Church, His body and bride, and for joy He sells all that He has  <a href="/2-corinthians/8-9.html">2&nbsp;Corinthians 8:9</a>  and buys the field, the treasure, and the pearl. <P><B><span>heaven</span></B> <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/matthew/matthew-3.html#Mt3_2">Matthew&nbsp;3:2</a>")</I>  <P><P><P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/matthew/13-49.html"><B>13&#058;49</B></a>&nbsp; So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just, <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>end of the</span></B> consummation of the age.  <a href="/matthew/24-3.html">Matthew 24:3</a> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/matthew/13-55.html"><B>13&#058;55</B></a>&nbsp; Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas? <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>James</span></B> <P>Son of Alphaeus. <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/matthew/matthew-4.html#Mt4_21">Matthew&nbsp;4:21</a>")</I>  <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><!--pageCount=1-->
