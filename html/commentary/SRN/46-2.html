This, of necessity, refers to the original documents, not to translations and versions; but the labours of competent scholars have brought our English versions to a degree of perfection so remarkable that we may confidently rest upon them as authoritative. <P>(2)  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=1 Corinthians+2:9-14">1&nbsp;Corinthians 2:9-14</a>  gives the process by which a truth passes from the mind of God to the minds of His people. <P>(a) The unseen things of God are undiscoverable by the natural man ( <a href="/1-corinthians/2-9.html">1&nbsp;Corinthians 2:9</a> ). (b) These unseen things God has revealed to chosen men ( <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=1 Corinthians+2:10-12">1&nbsp;Corinthians 2:10-12</a> ). (c) The revealed things are communicated in Spirit-taught words ( <a href="/1-corinthians/2-13.html">1&nbsp;Corinthians 2:13</a> ). This implies neither mechanical dictation nor the effacement of the writer's personality, but only that the Spirit infallibly guides in the choice of words from the writer's own vocabulary ( <a href="/1-corinthians/2-13.html">1&nbsp;Corinthians 2:13</a> ). (d) These Spirit-taught words, in which the revelation has been expressed, are discerned, as to their true spiritual content, only by the spiritual among believers ;  <a href="/1-corinthians/2-15.html">1 Corinthians 2:15</a>  <a href="/1-corinthians/2-16.html">1 Corinthians 2:16</a> ; <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/revelation/revelation-22.html#Re22_19">Revelation&nbsp;22:19</a>")</I> . <P><P><P><P><P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/1-corinthians/2-14.html"><B>2&#058;14</B></a>&nbsp; But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>natural man</span></B> <P>Paul divides men into three classes: psuchikos, "of the senses"  <a href="/james/3-15.html">James 3:15</a> ;  <a href="/jude/1-19.html">Jude 1:19</a>  or "natural," i.e. the Adamic man, unrenewed through the new birth  <a href="/john/3-3.html">John 3:3</a>  <a href="/john/3-5.html">John 3:5</a>  pneumatikos, "spiritual," i.e. the renewed man as Spirit-filled and walking in the Spirit in full communion with God  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Ephesians+5:18-20">Ephesians 5:18-20</a>  and sarkikos, "carnal," "fleshly," i.e. the renewed man who, walking "after the flesh," remains a babe in Christ  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=1 Corinthians+3:1-4">1&nbsp;Corinthians 3:1-4</a> .
