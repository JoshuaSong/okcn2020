The former Roman empire (the iron kingdom of  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Daniel+2:33-35">Daniel 2:33-35</a>  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Daniel+2:40-44">Daniel 2:40-44</a> ;  <a href="/daniel/7-7.html"> 7:7</a>  will have ten horns (i.e. kings,  <a href="/revelation/17-12.html">Revelation 17:12</a>  corresponding to the ten toes of the image. As Daniel considers this vision of the ten kings, there rises up amongst them a "little horn" (king), who subdues three of the ten kings so completely that the separate identity of their kingdoms is destroyed. Seven kings of the ten are left, and the "little horn." He is the "king of fierce countenance" typified by that other "king of fierce countenance," Antiochus Epiphanes,  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Daniel+8:23-25">Daniel 8:23-25</a>  the "prince that shall come" of  <a href="/daniel/9-26.html">Daniel 9:26</a>  <a href="/daniel/9-27.html">Daniel 9:27</a>  the "king" of  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Daniel+11:36-45">Daniel 11:36-45</a>  the "abomination" of ;  <a href="/daniel/12-11.html">Daniel 12:11</a> ;  <a href="/matthew/24-15.html">Matthew 24:15</a>  the "man of sin" of  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=2 Thessalonians+2:4-8">2&nbsp;Thessalonians 2:4-8</a>  and the "Beast" of  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Revelation+13:4-10">Revelation 13:4-10</a> .
