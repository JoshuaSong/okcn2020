Natural affection is to be, as compared with the believer's devotedness to Christ, as if it were hate. See  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Matthew+12:47-50">Matthew 12:47-50</a>  where Christ illustrates this principle in His own person. But in the Lord the natural affections are sanctified and lifted to the level of the divine love (cf) ;  <a href="/john/19-26.html">John 19:26</a>  <a href="/john/19-27.html">John 19:27</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Ephesians+5:25-28">Ephesians 5:25-28</a> . <P><P><P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><!--pageCount=1-->
