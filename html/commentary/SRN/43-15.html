On the other hand, the abiding one takes all burdens to Him, and draws all wisdom, life and strength from Him. It is not unceasing consciousness of these things, and of Him, but that nothing is allowed in the life which separates from Him. <P>See "Fellowship,"  <a href="/1-john/1-3.html">1&nbsp;John 1:3</a> .
