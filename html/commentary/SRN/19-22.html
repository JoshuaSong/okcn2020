The bones (of the hands, arms, shoulders, and pelvis) out of joint ( <a href="/psalms/22-14.html">Psalms 22:14</a> ) the profuse perspiration caused by intense suffering (v. 14); the action of the heart affected (v .14); strength exhausted, and extreme thirst ( <a href="/psalms/22-15.html">Psalms 22:15</a> ); the hands and feet pierced ( <a href="/psalms/22-16.html">Psalms 22:16</a> ) partial nudity with hurt to modesty ( <a href="/psalms/22-17.html">Psalms 22:17</a> ), are all incidental to that mode of death. The accompanying circumstances are precisely those fulfilled in the crucifixion of Christ.  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Psalms+22:14-17">Psalms 22:14-17</a> .
