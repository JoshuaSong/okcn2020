In both passages the context, as in  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Zechariah+14:1-3">Zechariah 14:1-3</a>  associates the earthquake with the Gentile invasion under the Beast ;  <a href="/daniel/7-8.html">Daniel 7:8</a> ;  <a href="/revelation/19-20.html">Revelation 19:20</a> . Surely, in a land seamed by seismic disturbances it should not be difficult to believe that another earthquake might cleave the little hill called the Mount of Olives. Not one of the associated events of Zech. 14 occurred at the first coming of Christ, closely associated though He then was with the Mount of Olives. <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/zechariah/14-9.html"><B>14&#058;9</B></a>&nbsp; And the LORD shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall there be one LORD, and his name one. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>king over all the earth</span></B> <P>The final answer to the prayer of  <a href="/matthew/6-10.html">Matthew 6:10</a> .
