God forbid. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>What then</span></B> <P>The old relation to the law and sin, and the new relation to Christ and life are illustrated by the effect of death upon servitude  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Romans+6:16-23">Romans 6:16-23</a>  and marriage  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Romans+7:1-6">Romans 7:1-6</a> . <P>(1) The old servitude was nominally to the law, but, since the law had no delivering power, the real master continued to be sin in the nature. The end was death. The law could not give life, and "sin" (here personified as the old self) is in itself deathful. But death in another form, ie., crucifixion with Christ, has intervened to free the servant from his double bondage to sin ( <a href="/romans/6-6.html">Romans 6:6</a>  <a href="/romans/6-7.html">Romans 6:7</a> ), and to the law  <a href="/romans/7-4.html">Romans 7:4</a>  <a href="/romans/7-6.html">Romans 7:6</a>  <P>(2) This effect of death is further illustrated by widowhood. Death dissolves the marriage relation  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Romans+7:1-3">Romans 7:1-3</a> . As natural death frees a wife from the law of her husband, so crucifixion with Christ sets the believer free from the law. <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/galatians/galatians-3.html#Ga3_24">Galatians&nbsp;3:24</a>")</I>  <P><P><P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/romans/6-16.html"><B>6&#058;16</B></a>&nbsp; Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness? <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>sin</span></B> Sin. <P><I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/romans/romans-3.html#Ro3_23">Romans&nbsp;3:23</a>")</I> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/romans/6-17.html"><B>6&#058;17</B></a>&nbsp; But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>sin</span></B> Sin. <P><I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/romans/romans-3.html#Ro3_23">Romans&nbsp;3:23</a>")</I>  <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/romans/6-18.html"><B>6&#058;18</B></a>&nbsp; Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>sin</span></B> <P>Sin. <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/romans/romans-3.html#Ro3_23">Romans&nbsp;3:23</a>")</I> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/romans/6-19.html"><B>6&#058;19</B></a>&nbsp; I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>holiness</span></B> <P>sanctification. <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/revelation/revelation-22.html#Re22_11">Revelation&nbsp;22:11</a>")</I>  <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/romans/6-22.html"><B>6&#058;22</B></a>&nbsp; But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><P><B><span>sin</span></B> Sin. <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/romans/romans-3.html#Ro3_23">Romans&nbsp;3:23</a>")</I> . <P><B><span>holiness</span></B> sanctification. <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/revelation/revelation-22.html#Re22_11">Revelation&nbsp;22:11</a>")</I> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/romans/6-23.html"><B>6&#058;23</B></a>&nbsp; For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>sin</span></B> <P>Sin. <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/romans/romans-3.html#Ro3_23">Romans&nbsp;3:23</a>")</I> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><!--pageCount=1-->
