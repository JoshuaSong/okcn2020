Christian position in grace is the result of the work of Christ, and is fully entered the moment that Christ is received by faith ;  <a href="/john/1-12.html">John 1:12</a>  <a href="/john/1-13.html">John 1:13</a> ;  <a href="/romans/8-1.html">Romans 8:1</a>  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Romans+8:15-17">Romans 8:15-17</a> ;  <a href="/1-corinthians/1-2.html">1 Corinthians 1:2</a>  <a href="/1-corinthians/1-30.html">1 Corinthians 1:30</a> ;  <a href="/1-corinthians/12-12.html">1 Corinthians 12:12</a>  <a href="/1-corinthians/12-13.html">1 Corinthians 12:13</a> ;  <a href="/galatians/3-26.html">Galatians 3:26</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Ephesians+1:3-14">Ephesians 1:3-14</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Ephesians+2:4-9"> 2:4-9</a> ;  <a href="/1-peter/2-9.html">1&nbsp;Peter 2:9</a> ;  <a href="/revelation/1-6.html">Revelation 1:6</a> ;  <a href="/revelation/5-9.html">Revelation 5:9</a>  <a href="/revelation/5-10.html">Revelation 5:10</a> . The weakest, most ignorant, and fallible believer has precisely the same relationships in grace as the most illustrious saint.
