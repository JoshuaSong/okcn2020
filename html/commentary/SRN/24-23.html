At His first advent Christ, David's righteous Branch  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Luke+1:31-33">Luke 1:31-33</a>  did not "execute justice and judgment in the earth," but was crowned with thorns and crucified. Neither was Israel the nation restored, nor did the Jewish people say, "The Lord our righteousness." Cf.  <a href="/romans/10-3.html">Romans 10:3</a> .
