		<span><B>Chapter 35</B></span><P><a href="/genesis/35-7.html"><B>35&#058;7</B></a>&nbsp; And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel: because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother. <BLOCKQUOTE><P>1 {El-beth-el] <P>i.e. the God of Bethel. Cf.  <a href="/genesis/28-19.html">Genesis 28:19</a> . There it was the place as the scene of the ladder vision which impressed jacob. He called the place "Bethel," i.e. the house of God. Now it is the God of the place, rather than the place, and he calls it El-Bethel, i.e. "the God of the house of God." Cf.  <a href="/genesis/33-20.html">Genesis 33:20</a> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/genesis/35-14.html"><B>35&#058;14</B></a>&nbsp; And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>drink offering</span></B> <P>The first mention of the drink-offering. It is not mentioned among the Levitical offerings of Lev 1.-7., though included in the instructions for sacrifice in the land  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Numbers+15:5-7">Numbers 15:5-7</a> . It was always "poured out," never drunk, and may be considered a type of Christ in the sense of ;  <a href="/psalms/22-14.html">Psalms 22:14</a> ;  <a href="/isaiah/53-12.html">Isaiah 53:12</a> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/genesis/35-18.html"><B>35&#058;18</B></a>&nbsp; And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him Benjamin.  <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>Benjamin</span></B> <P>i.e. son of my right hand. Benjamin, "son of sorrow" to his mother, but "son of my right hand" to his father, becomes thus a double type of Christ. As Ben-oni He was the suffering One because of whom a sword pierced His mother's heart  <a href="/luke/2-35.html">Luke 2:35</a>  as Benjamin, head of the warrior tribe  <a href="/genesis/49-27.html">Genesis 49:27</a>  firmly joined to Judah the kingly tribe ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Genesis+49:8-12">Genesis 49:8-12</a> ;  <a href="/1-kings/12-21.html">1&nbsp;Kings 12:21</a>  he becomes a type of the victorious One. It is noteworthy that Benjamin was especially honoured among the Gentiles  <a href="/genesis/45-22.html">Genesis 45:22</a> . <P>So manifold are the distinctions of Christ that many personal types of Him are needed. Joseph is not complete, Benjamin standing only for Christ the sorrowful One  <a href="/isaiah/53-3.html">Isaiah 53:3</a>  <a href="/isaiah/53-4.html">Isaiah 53:4</a>  yet have power on earth.
