And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? <BLOCKQUOTE><P>The literary form of Lamentations is necessarily obscured in the translation. It is an acrostic dirge, the line arranged in couplets or triplet, each of which begins with a letter of the Hebrew alphabet. In the third Lament, which consists of sixty-six stanzas instead of twenty-two, each line of each triplet begins with the same letter, so that the entire sixty six verses are required to give the twenty-two letters of the alphabet. Thus verses 1-3 or our version form but three lines of the original, each line beginning with A, etc. <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/lamentations/3-58.html"><B>3&#058;58</B></a>&nbsp; O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>redeemed</span></B> <P>Heb.
