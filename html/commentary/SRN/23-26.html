"Body" is in the plural, "bodies."  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Isaiah+26:19-21">Isaiah 26:19-21</a>  with chapter 27., constitute Jehovah's answer to the plaint of Israel,  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Isaiah+26:11-18">Isaiah 26:11-18</a> . Verse 19 should read: "Thy dead shall live: my dead bodies shall rise" (i.e. the dead bodies of Jehovah's people). The restoration and re-establishment of Israel as a nation is also spoken of as a resurrection  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Ezekiel+37:1-11">Ezekiel 37:1-11</a>  and many hold that no more than this is meant in  <a href="/isaiah/26-19.html">Isaiah 26:19</a> . But since the first resurrection is unto participation in the kingdom  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Revelation+20:4-6">Revelation 20:4-6</a>  it seems the better view that both meanings are here. <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><!--pageCount=1-->
