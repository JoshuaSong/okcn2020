The altar of burnt offering is double the height of the mercy-seat. The atonement more than saves us-- it glorifies God  <a href="/john/17-14.html">John 17:14</a> . <P><B><span>shittim</span></B> i.e. acacia. <P><B><span>wood</span></B> The wood (Christ's humanity), completely inclosed in brass, must have become completely charred by sacrificial fires. Cf.  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Hebrews+10:5-7">Hebrews 10:5-7</a> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/exodus/27-2.html"><B>27&#058;2</B></a>&nbsp; And thou shalt make the horns of it upon the four corners thereof: his horns shall be of the same: and thou shalt overlay it with brass. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>brass</span></B> <P>Cf.  <a href="/numbers/21-9.html">Numbers 21:9</a> ;  <a href="/john/3-14.html">John 3:14</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=John+12:31-33"> 12:31-33</a>  thus fixing the symbolic meaning of brass as divine manifestation in judgment. <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/exodus/27-6.html"><B>27&#058;6</B></a>&nbsp; And thou shalt make staves for the altar, staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with brass. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>shittim</span></B> <P>i.e. acacia. <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/exodus/27-9.html"><B>27&#058;9</B></a>&nbsp; And thou shalt make the court of the tabernacle: for the south side southward there shall be hangings for the court of fine twined linen of an hundred cubits long for one side: <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>fine twined linen</span></B> <P>The fine linen commonly typifies personal righteousness  <a href="/exodus/26-1.html">Exodus 26:1</a>  ref. (d), and in the hangings of the court stands for that measure of righteousness which God demands of any who would, in his own righteousness, approach. Christ, figuratively speaking, put up the hangings of the court in  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Luke+10:25-28">Luke 10:25-28</a> . The only way of approach was the "gate" ;  <a href="/exodus/27-16.html">Exodus 27:16</a> ;  <a href="/john/10-9.html">John 10:9</a> . The hangings of the court bar out equally the self-righteous man and the open sinner, for the height was above seven feet.  <a href="/exodus/27-18.html">Exodus 27:18</a> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/exodus/27-16.html"><B>27&#058;16</B></a>&nbsp; And for the gate of the court shall be an hanging of twenty cubits, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, wrought with needlework: and their pillars shall be four, and their sockets four. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>gate</span></B> <P>In the hangings of the court ( <a href="/exodus/27-9.html">Exodus 27:9</a> ), representing that practical righteousness which God demands in the law, and which, therefore, bars out all men ;  <a href="/romans/3-19.html">Romans 3:19</a>  <a href="/romans/3-20.html">Romans 3:20</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Romans+10:3-5"> 10:3-5</a> . No colours are inwrought. But the "gate" is Christ  <a href="/john/10-9.html">John 10:9</a>  and so the colours reappear as in the veil  <a href="/exodus/26-31.html">Exodus 26:31</a> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/exodus/27-17.html"><B>27&#058;17</B></a>&nbsp; All the pillars round about the court shall be filleted with silver; their hooks shall be of silver, and their sockets of brass. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>pillars</span></B> <P>The fillets and hooks upholding the linen hangings are of silver <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/exodus/exodus-38.html#Ex38_27">Exodus&nbsp;38:27</a>")</I> for it is in virtue of His redemptive work that Christ is our way of access, and not by virtue of His righteous life (symbolized by the fine linen); but the pillars of the court rest upon brass sockets, not silver as in the case of the boards See Scofield " <a href="/exodus/26-19.html">Exodus 26:19</a> " and brass symbolizes divine righteousness in judgment See Scofield " <a href="/numbers/21-9.html">Numbers 21:9</a> ". Redemption not only displays God's mercy, but vindicates His righteousness in showing that mercy.  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Romans+3:21-26">Romans 3:21-26</a> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/exodus/27-19.html"><B>27&#058;19</B></a>&nbsp; All the vessels of the tabernacle in all the service thereof, and all the pins thereof, and all the pins of the court, shall be of brass. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>brass</span></B> <P><I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/numbers/numbers-21.html#Nu21_9">Numbers&nbsp;21:9</a>")</I> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/exodus/27-20.html"><B>27&#058;20</B></a>&nbsp; And thou shalt command the children of Israel, that they bring thee pure oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamp to burn always. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>oil</span></B> <P>Oil is a symbol of the Holy Spirit (Cf)  <a href="/john/3-34.html">John 3:34</a> ;  <a href="/hebrews/1-9.html">Hebrews 1:9</a> . In Christ the oil- fed Light ever burns, the Light of the world  <a href="/john/8-12.html">John 8:12</a> . But here we have not the world, but the sanctuary. It is a question, not of testimony in and to the world, but of our communion and worship as believer-priests in the holiest  <a href="/hebrews/10-19.html">Hebrews 10:19</a>  <a href="/hebrews/10-20.html">Hebrews 10:20</a> . In the Tabernacle there were two compartments, two lights: the holy place with the candlestick <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/exodus/exodus-25.html#Ex25_31">Exodus&nbsp;25:31</a>")</I> the holy of holies with the shekinah, or manifested glory of God. These two places are now one ;  <a href="/matthew/27-50.html">Matthew 27:50</a>  <a href="/matthew/27-51.html">Matthew 27:51</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Hebrews+9:6-8">Hebrews 9:6-8</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Hebrews+10:19-21"> 10:19-21</a>  but it is important to see that there are still two lights: Christ, the Light of life  <a href="/john/8-12.html">John 8:12</a>  through the Spirit giving light upon the holy things of God, the showbread and altar of incense; and also the shekinah, now on the face of Jesus Christ  <a href="/2-corinthians/4-6.html">2&nbsp;Corinthians 4:6</a> . Into this twofold light we, as believer- priests, are brought  <a href="/1-peter/2-9.html">1&nbsp;Peter 2:9</a> . We "walk in the light," not merely which He gives, but in which He lives  <a href="/1-john/1-7.html">1&nbsp;John 1:7</a> . But what of the command to "bring pure oil"  <a href="/exodus/27-20.html">Exodus 27:20</a> . Because our access, apprehension, communion, and transformation are by the Spirit ;  <a href="/ephesians/2-18.html">Ephesians 2:18</a> ;  <a href="/1-corinthians/2-14.html">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>  <a href="/1-corinthians/2-15.html">1 Corinthians 2:15</a> ;  <a href="/2-corinthians/13-14.html">2&nbsp;Corinthians 13:14</a> ;  <a href="/philippians/2-1.html">Philippians 2:1</a> ;  <a href="/2-corinthians/3-18.html">2&nbsp;Corinthians 3:18</a> . Our title to His presence is the blood  <a href="/ephesians/2-13.html">Ephesians 2:13</a>  but only as filled with the Spirit  <a href="/ephesians/5-18.html">Ephesians 5:18</a>  do we really walk in the light. <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><!--pageCount=1-->
