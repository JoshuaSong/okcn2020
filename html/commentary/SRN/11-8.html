The temple, like the believer  <a href="/1-thessalonians/5-23.html">1&nbsp;Thessalonians 5:23</a>  was threefold: the court, that which was outward, visible, answered to the body; the holy place, where everything appealed to the sacred emotions, answered to the soul; the holy of holies, the place of communion with God  <a href="/exodus/25-22.html">Exodus 25:22</a>  answered to the spirit of man. The ark was the most all- inclusive type of Christ of any one of the vessels of the tabernacle. <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/exodus/exodus-25.html#Ex25_9">Exodus&nbsp;25:9</a>")</I> . When, therefore, the priests brought the ark into the court, the holy place, and the holy of holies, they were, in type, enthroning Christ over the body, with its powers and appetites; the soul, seat of the emotions and desires; and the mind, seat of the capacity to know and commune with God. See Scofield " <a href="/genesis/1-26.html">Genesis 1:26</a> " note 3.
