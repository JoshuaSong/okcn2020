I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>Simon</span></B> <P>See  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=James+2:14-26">James 2:14-26</a> . When Jesus would justify the woman in the eyes of Simon, He points to her works, for only through her works could Simon see the proof of her faith; but when He would send the woman away in peace, He points to her faith, not her works. See ;  <a href="/titus/2-14.html">Titus 2:14</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Titus+3:4-8"> 3:4-8</a> . His own works can never be to the believer his own ground of assurance, which must rest upon the work of Christ (cf.  <a href="/matthew/7-22.html">Matthew 7:22</a>  <a href="/matthew/7-23.html">Matthew 7:23</a> ).
