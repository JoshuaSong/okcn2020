The Psalm begins with the joy of Christ in resurrection ( <a href="/psalms/40-1.html">Psalms 40:1</a>  <a href="/psalms/40-2.html">Psalms 40:2</a> ). He has been in the horrible pit of the grave, but has been brought up. Verses 3-5 are His resurrection testimony, His "new song." Verses 6 and 7 are retrospective. When sacrifice and offering had become abominable because of the wickedness of the people  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Isaiah+1:10-15">Isaiah 1:10-15</a>  then the obedient Servant came to make the pure offering ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Psalms+40:7-17">Psalms 40:7-17</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Hebrews+10:5-17">Hebrews 10:5-17</a> .
