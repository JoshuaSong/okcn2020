A discrepancy has been imagined.  <a href="/1-corinthians/10-8.html">1&nbsp;Corinthians 10:8</a> . gives the number of deaths in "one day";  <a href="/numbers/25-9.html">Numbers 25:9,</a>  the total number of deaths "in the plague." Some discrepant statements concerning numbers are, however, found in the existing manuscripts of the Hebrew Scriptures. These are most naturally ascribed to the fact that the Hebrews used letters in the place of numerals. The letters for Koph to Tau express hundreds up to four hundred. Five certain Hebrew letters, written in a different form, carry hundreds up to nine hundred, while thousands are expressed by two dots over the proper unit letter: e.g. the letter Teth, used alone, stands for 9; with two dots it stands for nine thousand. Error in transcription of Hebrew numbers thus becomes easy, preservation of numerical accuracy difficult. <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/1-corinthians/10-20.html"><B>10&#058;20</B></a>&nbsp; But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><P><B><span>devils</span></B>  (Greek - <a href="/lexicons/greek/kjv/adokimos.html"><span class="greek">Admivn</span></a> ;  <a href="/1-corinthians/10-21.html">1&nbsp;Corinthians 10:21,</a>  <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/matthew/matthew-7.html#Mt7_22">Matthew&nbsp;7:22</a>")</I> . <P><B><span>fellowship</span></B>  <a href="/1-corinthians/10-16.html">1&nbsp;Corinthians 10:16</a> . trans. communion. <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/1-corinthians/10-33.html"><B>10&#058;33</B></a>&nbsp; Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>saved</span></B> <P><I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/romans/romans-1.html#Ro1_16">Romans&nbsp;1:16</a>")</I> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><!--pageCount=1-->
