		<span><B>Chapter 16</B></span><P><a href="/leviticus/16-5.html"><B>16&#058;5</B></a>&nbsp; And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel two kids of the goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt offering. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>goats</span></B> <P>The two goats. The offering of the high priest for himself has no anti-type in Christ  <a href="/hebrews/7-26.html">Hebrews 7:26</a>  <a href="/hebrews/7-27.html">Hebrews 7:27</a> . The typical interest centres upon the two goats and the high priest. Typically <P>(1) all is done by the high priest  <a href="/hebrews/1-3.html">Hebrews 1:3</a>  "by Himself"), the people only bring the sacrifice ;  <a href="/matthew/26-47.html">Matthew 26:47</a> ;  <a href="/matthew/27-24.html">Matthew 27:24</a>  <a href="/matthew/27-25.html">Matthew 27:25</a> . <P>(2) The goat slain (Jehovah's lot) is that aspect of Christ's work which vindicates the holiness and righteousness of God as expressed in the law  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Romans+3:24-26">Romans 3:24-26</a>  and is expiatory. <P>(3) The living goat typifies that aspect of Christ's work which puts away our sins from before God  <a href="/hebrews/9-26.html">Hebrews 9:26</a> ;  <a href="/romans/8-33.html">Romans 8:33</a>  <a href="/romans/8-34.html">Romans 8:34</a> . <P>(4) The high priest entering the holiest, typifies Christ entering "heaven itself" with "His own blood" for us  <a href="/hebrews/9-11.html">Hebrews 9:11</a>  <a href="/hebrews/9-12.html">Hebrews 9:12</a> . His blood makes that to be a "throne of grace," and "mercy seat" which else must have been a throne of judgment. <P>(5) For us, the priests of the New Covenant, there is what Israel never had, a rent veil  <a href="/matthew/27-51.html">Matthew 27:51</a> ;  <a href="/hebrews/10-19.html">Hebrews 10:19</a>  <a href="/hebrews/10-20.html">Hebrews 10:20</a> . So that, for worship and blessing, we enter, in virtue of His blood, where He is, into the holiest ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Hebrews+4:14-16">Hebrews 4:14-16</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Hebrews+10:19-22"> 10:19-22</a> . The atonement of Christ, as interpreted by the O.T. sacrificial types, has these necessary elements: <P>(1) It is substitutionary--the offering takes the offerer's place in death. <P>(2) The law is not evaded but honored--every sacrificial death was an execution of the sentence of the law. <P>(3) The sinlessness of Him who bore our sins is expressed in every animal sacrifice--it must be without blemish. <P>(4) The effect of the atoning work of Christ is typified <P>(a) in the promises, "it shall be forgiven him"; and (b) in the peace-offering, the expression of fellowship--the highest privilege of the saint. <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/exodus/exodus-29.html#Ex29_33">Exodus&nbsp;29:33</a>")</I>  <P><P><P><P><P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/leviticus/16-6.html"><B>16&#058;6</B></a>&nbsp; And Aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin offering, which is for himself, and make an atonement for himself, and for his house. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><P><B><span>Atonement</span></B> <P>Atonement. The biblical use and meaning of the word must be sharply distinguished from its use in theology. In theology it is term which covers the whole sacrificial and redemptive work of Christ. In the O.T. atonement is the English word used to translate the Hebrew words which mean "cover," "coverings," or "to cover." Atonement (at-one-ment) is, therefore, not a translation of the hebrew, but a purely theologic concept. The Levitical offerings "covered" the sins of Israel until, and in anticipation of the Cross, but did not "take away"  <a href="/hebrews/10-4.html">Hebrews 10:4</a>  those sins. These were the "sins done aforetime" ("covered" meantime by the Levitical sacrifices), which God "passed over"  <a href="/romans/3-25.html">Romans 3:25</a>  for which "passing over" God's righteousness was never vindicated until, in the Cross, Jesus Christ was "set forth a propitiation." See "Propitiation," <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/romans/romans-3.html#Ro3_25">Romans&nbsp;3:25</a>")</I> . It was the Cross, not the Levitical sacrifices which made "at-one-ment." The O.T. sacrifices enabled God to go on with a guilty people because they typified the Cross. To the offerer they were the confession of his desert of death, and the expression of his faith; to God they were the "shadows"  <a href="/hebrews/10-1.html">Hebrews 10:1</a>  of which Christ was the reality. <P><B><span>atonement</span></B> <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/exodus/exodus-29.html#Ex29_33">Exodus&nbsp;29:33</a>")</I> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/leviticus/16-11.html"><B>16&#058;11</B></a>&nbsp; And Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering, which is for himself, and shall make an atonement for himself, and for his house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering which is for himself: <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>atonement</span></B> <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/exodus/exodus-29.html#Ex29_33">Exodus&nbsp;29:33</a>")</I> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/leviticus/16-16.html"><B>16&#058;16</B></a>&nbsp; And he shall make an atonement for the holy place, because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions in all their sins: and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation, that remaineth among them in the midst of their uncleanness. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>atonement</span></B> <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/exodus/exodus-29.html#Ex29_33">Exodus&nbsp;29:33</a>")</I> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/leviticus/16-18.html"><B>16&#058;18</B></a>&nbsp; And he shall go out unto the altar that is before the LORD, and make an atonement for it; and shall take of the blood of the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>out unto the altar</span></B> <P>Dispensationally, for Israel, this is yet future; the High Priest is still in the holiest.
