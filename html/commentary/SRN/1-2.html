		<span><B>Chapter 2</B></span><P><a href="/genesis/2-3.html"><B>2&#058;3</B></a>&nbsp; And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>sanctified</span></B> <P>In the O.T. the same Hebrew word (qodesh) is translated sanctify, consecrate, dedicate, and holy. It means, set apart for the service of God. See refs. following "Sanctify," <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/genesis/genesis-2.html#Ge2_3">Genesis&nbsp;2:3</a>")</I> . <P><P><P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/genesis/2-4.html"><B>2&#058;4</B></a>&nbsp; These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens, <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>Lord</span></B> <P><B><span>Lord God</span></B> <P><B><span>Lord</span></B> <P>LORD (Heb. Jehovah) <P>(1) The primary meaning of the name LORD (Jehovah) is the "self-existent One." Literally (as in  <a href="/exodus/3-14.html">Exodus 3:14</a> ), "He that is who He is, therefore the eternal I AM:" <P>But Havah, from which Jehovah, or Yahwe, is formed, signifies also "to become," that is, to become known, thus pointing to a continuous and increasing self-revelation. Combining these meanings of Havah, we arrive at the meaning of the name Jehovah. He is "the self- existent One who reveals Himself." The name is, in itself, an advance upon the name "God" (El, Elah, Elohim), which suggests certain attributes of Deity, as strength, etc., rather than His essential being. <P>(2) It is significant that the first appearance of the name Jehovah in Scripture follows the creation of man. It was God (Elohim) who said, "Let us make man in our image" ( <a href="/genesis/1-26.html">Genesis 1:26</a> ); but when man, as in the second chapter of Genesis, is to fill the scene and become dominant over creation, it is the Lord God (Jehovah Elohim) who acts. This clearly indicates a special relation of Deity, in His Jehovah character, to man, and all Scripture emphasizes this. <P>(3) Jehovah is distinctly the redemption name of Deity. When sin entered and redemption became necessary, it was Jehovah Elohim who sought the sinning ones  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Genesis+3:9-13">Genesis 3:9-13</a>  and clothed them with "coats of skins"  <a href="/genesis/3-21.html">Genesis 3:21</a>  a beautiful type of righteousness provided by the Lord God through sacrifice  <a href="/romans/3-21.html">Romans 3:21</a>  <a href="/romans/3-22.html">Romans 3:22</a> . The first distinct revelation of Himself by His name Jehovah was in connection with the redemption of the covenant people out of Egypt  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Exodus+3:13-17">Exodus 3:13-17</a> . As Redeemer, emphasis is laid upon those attributes of Jehovah which the sin and salvation of man bring into exercise. These are: <P>(a) His holiness  <a href="/leviticus/11-44.html">Leviticus 11:44</a>  <a href="/leviticus/11-45.html">Leviticus 11:45</a> ;  <a href="/leviticus/19-1.html">Leviticus 19:1</a>  Leviticus 220:26 ;  <a href="/habakkuk/1-12.html">Habakkuk 1:12</a>  <a href="/habakkuk/1-13.html">Habakkuk 1:13</a>  (b) His hatred and judgment of sin ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Deuteronomy+32:35-42">Deuteronomy 32:35-42</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Genesis+6:5-7">Genesis 6:5-7</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Psalms+11:4-6">Psalms 11:4-6</a> ;  <a href="/psalms/66-18.html"> 66:18</a> ;  <a href="/exodus/34-6.html">Exodus 34:6</a>  <a href="/exodus/34-7.html">Exodus 34:7</a>  (c) His love for and redemption of sinners, but always righteously ;  <a href="/genesis/3-21.html">Genesis 3:21</a> ;  <a href="/genesis/8-20.html">Genesis 8:20</a>  <a href="/genesis/8-21.html">Genesis 8:21</a> ;  <a href="/exodus/12-12.html">Exodus 12:12</a>  <a href="/exodus/12-13.html">Exodus 12:13</a> ;  <a href="/leviticus/16-2.html">Leviticus 16:2</a>  <a href="/leviticus/16-3.html">Leviticus 16:3</a> ;  <a href="/isaiah/53-5.html">Isaiah 53:5</a>  <a href="/isaiah/53-6.html">Isaiah 53:6</a>  <a href="/isaiah/53-10.html">Isaiah 53:10</a>  Salvation by Jehovah apart from sacrifice is unknown to Scripture. <P><P><P><P><P>(4) In his redemptive relation to man, Jehovah has seven compound names which reveal Him as meeting every need of man from his lost state to the end. These compound names are: <P>(a) Jehovah-jireh, "the Lord will provide"  <a href="/genesis/22-13.html">Genesis 22:13</a>  <a href="/genesis/22-14.html">Genesis 22:14</a>  i.e., will provide a sacrifice; (b) Jehovah-rapha, "the Lord that healeth"  <a href="/exodus/15-26.html">Exodus 15:26</a> . That this refers to physical healing the context shows, but the deeper healing of soul malady is implied. (c) Jehovah-nissi, "the Lord our banner"  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Exodus+17:8-15">Exodus 17:8-15</a> . The name is interpreted by the context. The enemy was Amalek, a type of the flesh, and the conflict that day stands for the conflict of  <a href="/galatians/5-17.html">Galatians 5:17</a>  the war of the Spirit against the flesh. Victory was wholly due to divine help. (d) Jehovah-Shalom, "the Lord our peace," or "the Lord send peace"  <a href="/judges/6-24.html">Judges 6:24</a> . Almost the whole ministry of Jehovah finds expression and illustration in that chapter. Jehovah hates and judges sin  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Genesis+2:1-5">Genesis 2:1-5</a> . Jehovah loves and saves sinners  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Genesis+2:7-18">Genesis 2:7-18</a>  but only through sacrifice  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Genesis+2:19-21">Genesis 2:19-21</a>  see also ;  <a href="/romans/5-1.html">Romans 5:1</a> ;  <a href="/ephesians/2-14.html">Ephesians 2:14</a> ;  <a href="/colossians/1-20.html">Colossians 1:20</a> . (e) Jehovah-ra-ah, "the Lord my shepherd" (Psa 23.). In Ps. 22 Jehovah makes peace by the blood of the cross; in Ps 23. Jehovah is shepherding His own who are in the world. <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/john/john-10.html#Joh10_7">John&nbsp;10:7</a>")</I> (f) Jehovah-tsidkenu, "the Lord our righteousness"  <a href="/jeremiah/23-6.html">Jeremiah 23:6</a> . This name of Jehovah occurs in a prophecy concerning the future restoration and conversion of Israel. Then Israel will hail him as Jehovah-tsidkenu--"the Lord our righteousness." (g) Jehovah-shammah, "the Lord is present"  <a href="/ezekiel/48-35.html">Ezekiel 48:35</a> . This name signifies Jehovah's abiding presence with His people ;  <a href="/exodus/33-14.html">Exodus 33:14</a>  <a href="/exodus/33-15.html">Exodus 33:15</a> ;  <a href="/1-chronicles/16-27.html">1 Chronicles 16:27</a>  <a href="/1-chronicles/16-33.html">1 Chronicles 16:33</a> ;  <a href="/psalms/16-11.html">Psalms 16:11</a> ;  <a href="/psalms/97-5.html"> 97:5</a> ;  <a href="/matthew/28-20.html">Matthew 28:20</a> ;  <a href="/hebrews/13-5.html">Hebrews 13:5</a>  <P>(5) Lord (Jehovah) is also the distinctive name of Deity as in covenant with Israel  <a href="/exodus/19-3.html">Exodus 19:3</a> ;  <a href="/exodus/20-1.html">Exodus 20:1</a>  <a href="/exodus/20-2.html">Exodus 20:2</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Jeremiah+31:31-34">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a> . <P>(6) Lord God (Heb. Jehovah Elohim) is the first of the compound names of Deity. Lord God is used distinctly: <P>(1) of the relation of Deity to man (a) as Creator  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Genesis+2:7-15">Genesis 2:7-15</a>  (b) as morally in authority over man  <a href="/genesis/2-16.html">Genesis 2:16</a>  <a href="/genesis/2-17.html">Genesis 2:17</a>  (c) as creating and governing the earthly relationships of man ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Genesis+2:18-24">Genesis 2:18-24</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Genesis+3:16-19">Genesis 3:16-19</a>  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Genesis+3:22-24">Genesis 3:22-24</a>  and (d) as redeeming man  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Genesis+3:8-15">Genesis 3:8-15</a>  <a href="/genesis/3-21.html">Genesis 3:21</a>  <P>(2) of the relation of Deity to Israel  <a href="/genesis/24-7.html">Genesis 24:7</a> ;  <a href="/genesis/28-13.html"> 28:13</a> ;  <a href="/exodus/3-15.html">Exodus 3:15</a>  <a href="/exodus/3-18.html">Exodus 3:18</a> ;  <a href="/exodus/4-5.html"> 4:5</a> ;  <a href="/exodus/5-1.html"> 5:1</a> ;  <a href="/exodus/7-6.html"> 7:6</a> ;  <a href="/deuteronomy/1-11.html">Deuteronomy 1:11</a>  <a href="/deuteronomy/1-21.html">Deuteronomy 1:21</a> ;  <a href="/deuteronomy/4-1.html"> 4:1</a> ;  <a href="/deuteronomy/6-3.html"> 6:3</a> ;  <a href="/deuteronomy/12-1.html"> 12:1</a> ;  <a href="/joshua/7-13.html">Joshua 7:13</a>  <a href="/joshua/7-19.html">Joshua 7:19</a>  <a href="/joshua/7-20.html">Joshua 7:20</a> ;  <a href="/joshua/10-40.html">Joshua 10:40</a>  <a href="/joshua/10-42.html">Joshua 10:42</a> ;  <a href="/judges/2-12.html">Judges 2:12</a> ;  <a href="/1-samuel/2-30.html">1&nbsp;Samuel 2:30</a> ;  <a href="/1-kings/1-48.html">1&nbsp;Kings 1:48</a> ;  <a href="/2-kings/9-6.html">2&nbsp;Kings 9:6</a> ;  <a href="/2-kings/10-31.html">2&nbsp;Kings 10:31</a> ;  <a href="/1-chronicles/22-19.html">1&nbsp;Chronicles 22:19</a> ;  <a href="/2-chronicles/1-9.html">2&nbsp;Chronicles 1:9</a> ;  <a href="/ezra/1-3.html">Ezra 1:3</a> ;  <a href="/isaiah/21-17.html">Isaiah 21:17</a>  See other names of Deity, <P><I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/genesis/genesis-1.html#Ge1_1">Genesis&nbsp;1:1</a>")</I> See Scofield " <a href="/genesis/14-18.html">Genesis 14:18</a> " See Scofield " <a href="/genesis/15-2.html">Genesis 15:2</a> " See Scofield " <a href="/genesis/17-1.html">Genesis 17:1</a> " See Scofield " <a href="/genesis/21-33.html">Genesis 21:33</a> " See Scofield " <a href="/1-samuel/1-3.html">1&nbsp;Samuel 1:3</a> " <P><P><P><P><P><B><span>Lord God</span></B> Deity (names of God) <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/malachi/malachi-3.html#Mal3_18">Malachi&nbsp;3:18</a>")</I>  <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/genesis/2-14.html"><B>2&#058;14</B></a>&nbsp; And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria.
