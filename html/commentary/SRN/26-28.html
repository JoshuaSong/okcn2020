		<span><B>Chapter 28</B></span><P><a href="/ezekiel/28-12.html"><B>28&#058;12</B></a>&nbsp; Son of man, take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>Thou</span></B> <P>Here ( <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Ezekiel+28:12-15">Ezekiel 28:12-15</a> ), as in  <a href="/isaiah/14-12.html">Isaiah 14:12</a>  the language goes beyond the king of Tyre to Satan, inspirer and unseen ruler of all such pomp and pride as that of Tyre. Instances of thus indirectly addressing Satan are: ;  <a href="/genesis/3-14.html">Genesis 3:14</a>  <a href="/genesis/3-15.html">Genesis 3:15</a> ;  <a href="/matthew/16-23.html">Matthew 16:23</a> . The unfallen state of Satan is here described; his fall in  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Isaiah+14:12-14">Isaiah 14:12-14</a> . <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/revelation/revelation-20.html#Re20_10">Revelation&nbsp;20:10</a>")</I> . But there is more. The vision is not of Satan in his own person, but of Satan fulfilling himself in and through an earthly king who arrogates to himself divine honours, so that the prince of Tyrus foreshadows the Beast. ;  <a href="/daniel/7-8.html">Daniel 7:8</a> ;  <a href="/revelation/19-20.html">Revelation 19:20</a> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><!--pageCount=1-->
