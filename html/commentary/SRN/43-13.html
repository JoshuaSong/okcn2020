His feet would contract defilement and require cleansing, but not his body. So the believer is cleansed as before the law from all sin "once for all"  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Hebrews+10:1-12">Hebrews 10:1-12</a>  but needs ever to bring his daily sins to the Father in confession, that he may abide in unbroken fellowship with the Father and with the Son  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=1 John+1:1-10">1&nbsp;John 1:1-10</a> . The blood of Christ answers forever to all the law could say as to the believer's guilt, but he needs constant cleansing from the defilement of sin, ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Ephesians+5:25-27">Ephesians 5:25-27</a> ;  <a href="/1-john/5-6.html">1&nbsp;John 5:6</a> .

See, also, the order in  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Exodus+30:17-21">Exodus 30:17-21</a> . Christ cannot have communion with a defiled saint, but He can and will cleanse him. <P><B><span>washed</span></B> Lit. bathed. The Greek word signifies a complete ablution.
