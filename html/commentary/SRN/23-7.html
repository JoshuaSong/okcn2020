And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>Ephraim</span></B> <P>In the prophetic books "Ephraim" and "Israel" are the collective names of the ten tribes who, under Jeroboam, established the northern kingdom, subsequently called Samaria  <a href="/1-kings/16-24.html">1&nbsp;Kings 16:24</a>  and were (B.C. 722) sent into an exile which still continues.  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=2 Kings+17:1-6">2&nbsp;Kings 17:1-6</a> . <P>They are distinguished as "the outcasts of Israel" from "the dispersed of Judah."  <a href="/isaiah/11-12.html">Isaiah 11:12</a> . "Hidden" in the world  <a href="/matthew/13-44.html">Matthew 13:44</a>  they, with Judah, are yet to be restored to Palestine and made one nation again. ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Jeremiah+23:5-8">Jeremiah 23:5-8</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Ezekiel+37:11-24">Ezekiel 37:11-24</a> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/isaiah/7-3.html"><B>7&#058;3</B></a>&nbsp; Then said the LORD unto Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou, and Shearjashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field;  <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>Shearjashub</span></B> <P>Meaning, a remnant shall return.  <a href="/isaiah/8-3.html">Isaiah 8:3</a> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/isaiah/7-13.html"><B>7&#058;13</B></a>&nbsp; And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David; Is it a small thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God also? <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>Hear ye now</span></B> <P>The prophecy is not addressed to the faithless Ahaz, but to the whole "house of David." The objection that such a far-off event as the birth of Christ could be no "sign" to Ahaz, is, therefore, puerile. It was a continuing prophecy addressed to the Davidic family, and accounts at once for the instant assent of Mary.  <a href="/luke/1-38.html">Luke 1:38</a> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/isaiah/7-15.html"><B>7&#058;15</B></a>&nbsp; Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>Butter and honey</span></B> <P>Indicating the plainness and simplicity of the life in which the young Immanuel should be brought up. <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><!--pageCount=1-->
