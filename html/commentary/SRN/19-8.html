Christ was presented as Jehovah's Son and King, rejected and crucified but yet to reign in Zion. In Psa 8., while His deity is fully recognized ( <a href="/psalms/8-1.html">Psalms 8:1</a> ), Psa. 110 with  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Matthew+22:41-46">Matthew 22:41-46</a>  He is seen as Son of man  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Psalms+8:4-6">Psalms 8:4-6</a>  who, "made for a little while lower than the angels, " is to have dominion over the redeemed creation  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Hebrews+2:6-11">Hebrews 2:6-11</a> . The authority here is racial and Adamic, rather than purely divine as in Psa 2., or Davidic as in Psa 89. That which the first man lost, the second man and "last Adam" more than regained.  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Hebrews+2:6-11">Hebrews 2:6-11</a>  in connection with Psa. 8., and  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Romans+8:17-21">Romans 8:17-21</a>  show that the "many sons" whom He is bringing to glory, are joint heirs with Him in both the royal right of Psa. 2. and the human right of Heb. 2.
