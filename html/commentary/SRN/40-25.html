		<span><B>Chapter 25</B></span><P><a href="/matthew/25-1.html"><B>25&#058;1</B></a>&nbsp; Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><P><B><span>shall</span></B> <P>This part of the Olivet discourse goes beyond the "sign" questions of the disciples  <a href="/matthew/24-3.html">Matthew 24:3</a>  and presents our Lord's return in three aspects: <P>(1) As testing profession,  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Matthew+25:1-13">Matthew 25:1-13</a>  <P>(2) as testing service,  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Matthew+25:14-30">Matthew 25:14-30</a> ; <P>(3) as testing the Gentile nations,  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Matthew+25:31-46">Matthew 25:31-46</a> . <P><B><span>virgins</span></B> <P>The kingdom of heaven here is the sphere of profession, as in Mat 13. All alike have lamps, but two facts fix the real status of the foolish virgins: They "took no oil," and the Lord said, "I know you not." Oil is the symbol of the Holy Spirit, and "If any man have not the spirit of Christ, he is none of his"  <a href="/romans/8-9.html">Romans 8:9</a>  <P>Nor could the Lord say to any believer, however unspiritual, "I know you not." <P><B><span>heaven</span></B> <P><I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/matthew/matthew-3.html#Mt3_2">Matthew&nbsp;3:2</a>")</I>  <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/matthew/25-13.html"><B>25&#058;13</B></a>&nbsp; Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>Son of man</span></B> <P>Also  <a href="/matthew/24-31.html">Matthew 24:31</a> . <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/matthew/matthew-8.html#Mt8_20">Matthew&nbsp;8:20</a>")</I> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/matthew/25-14.html"><B>25&#058;14</B></a>&nbsp; For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>the kingdom of heaven is</span></B> <P>Omit the italicised words, "the kingdom of heaven is". <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/matthew/25-21.html"><B>25&#058;21</B></a>&nbsp; His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>Well done</span></B> <P>The Lord's commendation may be earned by the weakest of His servants; it is given for faithful service. <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/matthew/25-23.html"><B>25&#058;23</B></a>&nbsp; His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>Well done</span></B> <P>The same commendation is gained by the servant with two talents as by him with five; he was equally faithful though his gift was less. <P><P><P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/matthew/25-31.html"><B>25&#058;31</B></a>&nbsp; When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: <BLOCKQUOTE><P><P><B><span>Son of man</span></B> <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/matthew/matthew-8.html#Mt8_20">Matthew&nbsp;8:20</a>")</I> . <P><B><span>angels</span></B> <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/hebrews/hebrews-1.html#Heb1_4">Hebrews&nbsp;1:4</a>")</I>  <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/matthew/25-32.html"><B>25&#058;32</B></a>&nbsp; And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats: <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>And before him</span></B> <P>This judgment is to be distinguished from the judgment of the great white throne. Here there is no resurrection; the persons judged are living nations; no books are opened; three classes are present, sheep, goats, and brethren; the time is at the return of Christ ( <a href="/matthew/25-31.html">Matthew 25:31</a> ); and the scene is on the earth. All these particulars are in contrast with  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Revelation+20:11-15">Revelation 20:11-15</a> . <P>The test in this judgment is the treatment accorded by the nations to those whom Christ here call "my brethren." These "brethren" are the Jewish Remnant who will have preached the Gospel of the kingdom to all nations during the tribulation. See "Remnant"  <a href="/isaiah/1-9.html">Isaiah 1:9</a> ;  <a href="/romans/11-5.html">Romans 11:5</a> . <P>The test in  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Revelation+20:11-15">Revelation 20:11-15</a>  is the possession of eternal life.
