		<span><B>Chapter 18</B></span><P><a href="/revelation/18-1.html"><B>18&#058;1</B></a>&nbsp; And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>angel</span></B> <P><I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/hebrews/hebrews-1.html#Heb1_4">Hebrews&nbsp;1:4</a>")</I> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/revelation/18-2.html"><B>18&#058;2</B></a>&nbsp; And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>Babylon</span></B> <P>Babylon, "confusion," is repeatedly used by the prophets in a symbolic sense (<I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/isaiah/isaiah-13.html#Isa13_2">Isaiah&nbsp;13:2</a>")</I> ), note 2. Two "Babylons" are to be distinguished in the Revelation: ecclesiastical babylon, which is apostate Christendom, headed up under the Papacy; and political babylon, which is the Beast's confederated empire, the last form of Gentile world-dominion. Ecclesiastical Babylon is "the great whore"  <a href="/revelation/17-1.html">Revelation 17:1</a>  and is destroyed by political Babylon  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Revelation+17:15-18">Revelation 17:15-18</a>  that the beast may be the alone object of worship. ;  <a href="/2-thessalonians/2-3.html">2 Thessalonians 2:3</a>  <a href="/2-thessalonians/2-4.html">2 Thessalonians 2:4</a> ;  <a href="/revelation/13-15.html">Revelation 13:15</a> . The power of political Babylon is destroyed by the return of the Lord in glory. (See "Armageddon,") ;  <a href="/revelation/16-14.html">Revelation 16:14</a> ;  <a href="/revelation/19-17.html"> 19:17</a> . The notion of a literal Babylon to be rebuilt on the site of ancient Babylon is in conflict with  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Isaiah+13:19-22">Isaiah 13:19-22</a> . But the language of  <a href="/revelation/18-10.html">Revelation 18:10</a>  <a href="/revelation/18-16.html">Revelation 18:16</a>  <a href="/revelation/18-18.html">Revelation 18:18</a>  seems beyond question to identify "Babylon," the "city" of luxury and traffic, with "Babylon" the ecclesiastical centre, viz. Rome. The very kings who hate ecclesiastical Babylon deplore the destruction of commercial Babylon. <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/revelation/18-4.html"><B>18&#058;4</B></a>&nbsp; And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>sins</span></B> <P>Sin. <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/romans/romans-3.html#Ro3_23">Romans&nbsp;3:23</a>")</I> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/revelation/18-5.html"><B>18&#058;5</B></a>&nbsp; For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>sins</span></B> <P>Sin. <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/romans/romans-3.html#Ro3_23">Romans&nbsp;3:23</a>")</I> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/revelation/18-10.html"><B>18&#058;10</B></a>&nbsp; Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas, that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment come. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>Babylon</span></B> <P><I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/isaiah/isaiah-13.html#Isa13_1">Isaiah&nbsp;13:1</a>")</I> , note 2. <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/revelation/18-22.html"><B>18&#058;22</B></a>&nbsp; And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman, of whatsoever craft he be, shall be found any more in thee; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee; <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>voice</span></B> <P>Cf.  <a href="/isaiah/24-8.html">Isaiah 24:8</a>  contra,  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Revelation+14:1-3">Revelation 14:1-3</a> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><!--pageCount=1-->
