In what sense, then, could he be called in Luke "the son of Heli"? He could not be by natural generation the son both of Jacob and of Heli. But in Luke it is not said that Heli begat Joseph, so that the natural explanation is that Joseph was the son-in-law of Heli, who was, like himself, a descendant of David. That he should in that case be called "son of Heli" ("son" is not in the Greek, but rightly supplied by the translators) would be in accord with Jewish usage. <P>(CF)  <a href="/1-samuel/24-16.html">1&nbsp;Samuel 24:16</a>  The conclusion is therefore inevitable that in Luke we have Mary's genealogy; and Joseph was "son of Heli" because espoused to Heli's daughter. The genealogy in Luke is Mary's, whose father, Heli, was descended from David. <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/luke/3-36.html"><B>3&#058;36</B></a>&nbsp; Which was the son of Cainan, which was the son of Arphaxad, which was the son of Sem, which was the son of Noe, which was the son of Lamech, <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>Arphaxad</span></B> <P>Arphaxad.  <a href="/genesis/10-22.html">Genesis 10:22</a> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><!--pageCount=1-->
