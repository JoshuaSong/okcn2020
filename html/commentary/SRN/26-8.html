The visions are retrospective; Israel had done these things, hence the captivities. This strain continues to  <a href="/ezekiel/33-20.html">Ezekiel 33:20</a> . It is the divine view of the national sinfulness and apostasy, revealed to Ezekiel in a series of visions so vivid that though the prophet was by the river Chebar, ;  <a href="/ezekiel/1-1.html">Ezekiel 1:1</a>  <a href="/ezekiel/1-3.html">Ezekiel 1:3</a> ;  <a href="/ezekiel/3-23.html"> 3:23</a> ;  <a href="/ezekiel/10-15.html">Ezekiel 10:15</a>  <a href="/ezekiel/10-20.html">Ezekiel 10:20</a>  <a href="/ezekiel/10-22.html">Ezekiel 10:22</a> ;  <a href="/ezekiel/43-3.html"> 43:3</a>  It was as if he were transported back to Jerusalem, and to the time when these things were occurring.
