		<span><B>Chapter 2</B></span><P><a href="/haggai/2-1.html"><B>2&#058;1</B></a>&nbsp; In the seventh month, in the one and twentieth day of the month, came the word of the LORD by the prophet Haggai, saying, <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>seventh month</span></B> <P>i.e. October. <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/haggai/2-3.html"><B>2&#058;3</B></a>&nbsp; Who is left among you that saw this house in her first glory? and how do ye see it now? is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing? <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>house in her first glory</span></B> <P>The prophet calls upon the old men who remembered Solomon's temple to witness to the new generation how greatly that structure exceeded the present in magnificence; and then utters a prophecy ( <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Haggai+1:7-9">Haggai 1:7-9</a> ) which can only refer to the future kingdom temple described by Ezekiel. It is certain that the restoration temple and all subsequent structures, including Herod's, were far inferior in costliness and splendour to Solomon's. The present period is described in  <a href="/hosea/3-4.html">Hosea 3:4</a>  <a href="/hosea/3-5.html">Hosea 3:5</a> . Verse 6 is quoted in  <a href="/hebrews/12-26.html">Hebrews 12:26</a>  <a href="/hebrews/12-27.html">Hebrews 12:27</a> . Verse 7: "I will shake all nations," refers to the great tribulation and is followed by the coming of Christ in glory, as in  <a href="/matthew/24-29.html">Matthew 24:29</a>  <a href="/matthew/24-30.html">Matthew 24:30</a> . "The desire of all nations" is Christ. <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/malachi/malachi-3.html#Mal3_1">Malachi&nbsp;3:1</a>")</I> . <P><P><P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/haggai/2-9.html"><B>2&#058;9</B></a>&nbsp; The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, saith the LORD of hosts: and in this place will I give peace, saith the LORD of hosts. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><P><B><span>latter house</span></B> <P>In a sense all the temples (i.e Solomon's; Ezra's; Herod's; that which will be used by the unbelieving Jews under covenant with the Beast  <a href="/daniel/9-27.html">Daniel 9:27</a> ;  <a href="/matthew/24-15.html">Matthew 24:15</a> ;  <a href="/2-thessalonians/2-3.html">2 Thessalonians 2:3</a>  <a href="/2-thessalonians/2-4.html">2 Thessalonians 2:4</a>  and Ezekiel's future kingdom temple Ez 40.-47.), are treated as one "house"-- the "house of the Lord," since they all profess to be that. For that reason Christ purified the temple of His day, erected though it was by an Idumean usurper to please the Jews.  <a href="/matthew/21-12.html">Matthew 21:12</a>  <a href="/matthew/21-13.html">Matthew 21:13</a> . <P><B><span>glory</span></B> Or, the future glory of this house shall be greater than the former. <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/haggai/2-12.html"><B>2&#058;12</B></a>&nbsp; If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any meat, shall it be holy? And the priests answered and said, No. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>holy flesh</span></B> <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/jeremiah/jeremiah-11.html#Jer11_15">Jeremiah&nbsp;11:15</a>")</I> . <!--pageCount=1-->
