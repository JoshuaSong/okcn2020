It could not be said of a self-righteous, Christ rejecting pharisee, that the kingdom of God, as to its spiritual content, was within him. Our Lord's whole answer, designedly enigmatic to the Pharisees (cf)  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Matthew+13:10-13">Matthew 13:10-13</a>  had a dispensational meaning. The kingdom in its outward form, as covenanted to David  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=2 Samuel+7:8-17">2&nbsp;Samuel 7:8-17</a>  and described by the prophets <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/zechariah/zechariah-12.html#Zec12_8">Zechariah&nbsp;12:8</a>")</I> had been rejected by the Jews; so that, during this present age, it would not "come with observation" (lit. "outward show") but in the hearts of men (cf) ;  <a href="/luke/19-11.html">Luke 19:11</a>  <a href="/luke/19-12.html">Luke 19:12</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Acts+1:6-8">Acts 1:6-8</a> . <P><I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/acts/acts-1.html#Ac1_6">Acts&nbsp;1:6</a>")</I> .
