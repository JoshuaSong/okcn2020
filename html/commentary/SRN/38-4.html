That which marks the ministry of the "two witnesses"  <a href="/revelation/11-3.html">Revelation 11:3</a>  <a href="/revelation/11-4.html">Revelation 11:4</a>  is power. (Cf  <a href="/zechariah/4-6.html">Zechariah 4:6</a> ). In measure this power would rest upon Zerubbabel, who, having begun the restoration temple of Zechariah's time, would finish it (v.9) laying the "headstone" amid the shoutings of the people. The whole scene forms a precursive fulfilment of the ministry of the two witnesses of Rev. 11. and of the coming of the true "headstone," Prince Messiah, of whom prince Zerubbabel is a type. Oil is a uniform symbol of the Spirit. <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/acts/acts-2.html#Ac2_4">Acts&nbsp;2:4</a>")</I> . Joshua and Zerubbabel were doubtless the two olive trees for that day, as the two witnesses of Rev. 11. may, in turn, but point to Christ as Priest-King in the kingdom- age.  <a href="/zechariah/6-12.html">Zechariah 6:12</a>  <a href="/zechariah/6-13.html">Zechariah 6:13</a> . <P><P><P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/zechariah/4-10.html"><B>4&#058;10</B></a>&nbsp; For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel with those seven; they are the eyes of the LORD, which run to and fro through the whole earth.  <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>eyes</span></B> <P><I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/zechariah/zechariah-3.html#Zec3_9">Zechariah&nbsp;3:9</a>")</I>  <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><!--pageCount=1-->
