Hence the word is used to express the eternal duration of the being of God,  <a href="/psalms/90-2.html">Psalms 90:2</a> . "From everlasting to everlasting"), and is the Hebrew synonym of the Greek "aion," age or dispensation. <P><I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/genesis/genesis-1.html#Ge1_26">Genesis&nbsp;1:26</a>")</I> , note (4). <P>(2) The ideas therefore of things kept secret and of indefinite duration combine in this word. Both ideas inhere in the doctrine of the dispensations or ages. They are among the "mysteries" of God  <a href="/ephesians/1-9.html">Ephesians 1:9</a>  <a href="/ephesians/1-10.html">Ephesians 1:10</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Ephesians+3:2-6"> 3:2-6</a> ;  <a href="/matthew/13-11.html">Matthew 13:11</a> . The "everlasting" God (El Olam) is therefore that name of Deity in virtue of which He is the God whose wisdom has divided all time and eternity into the mystery of successive ages or dispensations. It is not merely that He is everlasting, but that He is God over everlasting things.
