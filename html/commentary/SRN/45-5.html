The demonstration is simple. <P>(1) Death is universal ( <a href="/romans/4-12.html">Romans 4:12</a>  <a href="/romans/4-14.html">Romans 4:14</a> ), all die: sinless infants, moral people, religious people, equally with the depraved. For a universal effect there must be a universal cause; that cause is a state of universal sin ( <a href="/romans/5-12.html">Romans 5:12</a> ). <P>(2) But this universal state must have had a cause. It did. The consequence of Adam's sin was that "the many were made sinners" ( <a href="/romans/5-19.html">Romans 5:19</a> )--"By the offence of one judgment came upon all men unto condemnation" ( <a href="/romans/5-18.html">Romans 5:18</a> ). <P>(3) Personal sins are not meant here. From Adam to Moses death reigned ( <a href="/romans/5-14.html">Romans 5:14</a> ), although, there being no law, personal guilt was not imputed ( <a href="/romans/5-13.html">Romans 5:13</a> ). Accordingly, from  <a href="/genesis/4-7.html">Genesis 4:7</a>  to  <a href="/exodus/29-14.html">Exodus 29:14</a>  the sin-offering is not once mentioned. Then, since physical death from Adam to Moses was not due to the sinful acts of those who die ( <a href="/romans/5-13.html">Romans 5:13</a> ), it follows that it was due to a universal sinful state, or nature, and that state is declared to be out inheritance from Adam. <P>(4) the moral state of fallen man is described in Scripture  <a href="/genesis/6-5.html">Genesis 6:5</a> ;  <a href="/1-kings/8-46.html">1&nbsp;Kings 8:46</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Psalms+14:1-3">Psalms 14:1-3</a> ;  <a href="/psalms/39-5.html"> 39:5</a> ;  <a href="/jeremiah/17-9.html">Jeremiah 17:9</a> ;  Matthew 18:11 ;  <a href="/mark/7-20.html">Mark 7:20</a>  <a href="/mark/7-23.html">Mark 7:23</a> ;  <a href="/romans/1-21.html">Romans 1:21</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Romans+2:1-29"> 2:1-29</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Romans+3:9-19"> 3:9-19</a>  ;  <a href="/romans/7-24.html"> 7:24</a> ;  <a href="/romans/8-7.html"> 8:7</a> ;  <a href="/john/3-6.html">John 3:6</a> ;  <a href="/1-corinthians/2-14.html">1&nbsp;Corinthians 2:14</a> ;  <a href="/2-corinthians/3-14.html">2&nbsp;Corinthians 3:14</a> ;  <a href="/2-corinthians/4-4.html"> 4:4</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Galatians+5:19-21">Galatians 5:19-21</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Ephesians+2:1-3">Ephesians 2:1-3</a>  <a href="/ephesians/2-11.html">Ephesians 2:11</a>  <a href="/ephesians/2-12.html">Ephesians 2:12</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Ephesians+4:18-22"> 4:18-22</a> ;  <a href="/colossians/1-21.html">Colossians 1:21</a> ;  <a href="/hebrews/3-13.html">Hebrews 3:13</a> ;  <a href="/james/4-14.html">James 4:14</a> ;  <a href="/1-corinthians/15-22.html">1&nbsp;Corinthians 15:22</a> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/romans/5-14.html"><B>5&#058;14</B></a>&nbsp; Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>Adam to Moses</span></B> <P>Broadly, the contrast is: Adam: sin, death; Christ: righteousness, life.
