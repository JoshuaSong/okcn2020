		<span><B>Chapter 4</B></span><P><a href="/ezra/4-2.html"><B>4&#058;2</B></a>&nbsp; Then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the fathers, and said unto them, Let us build with you: for we seek your God, as ye do; and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assur, which brought us up hither. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>for we seek</span></B> <P>The people of the land sought to hinder the work in three ways: <P>(1) by seeking to draw the Jews into an unreal union,  <a href="/ezra/4-3.html">Ezra 4:3</a> . (cf)  <a href="/2-kings/17-32.html">2&nbsp;Kings 17:32</a> . <P>(2) by "weakening the hands of the people of Judah,"  <a href="/ezra/4-4.html">Ezra 4:4</a>  i.e, by withholding supplies, etc.; and <P>(3) by accusations lodged with Ahasuerus and Darius. The first was by far the most subtle and dangerous. The lives of Ezra and Nehemiah afford many illustrations of true separation.  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=2 Corinthians+6:14-18">2&nbsp;Corinthians 6:14-18</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=2 Timothy+2:19-21">2&nbsp;Timothy 2:19-21</a> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/ezra/4-6.html"><B>4&#058;6</B></a>&nbsp; And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they unto him an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>Ahasuerus</span></B> <P>The Cambyses of secular history (529-521 BC); not the Ahasuerus of Esther, who is the Xerxes of secular history (485 BC). <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/daniel/daniel-5.html#Da5_31">Daniel&nbsp;5:31</a>")</I> . <P><P><P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/ezra/4-7.html"><B>4&#058;7</B></a>&nbsp; And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of their companions, unto Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the writing of the letter was written in the Syrian tongue, and interpreted in the Syrian tongue.  <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>Artaxerxes</span></B> <P>The Artaxerxes of  <a href="/ezra/4-7.html">Ezra 4:7</a>  is identical with Ahasuerus of  <a href="/ezra/4-6.html">Ezra 4:6,</a>  i.e. the Cambyses of profane history. The Artaxerxes of  <a href="/ezra/7-1.html">Ezra 7:1</a>  is the Longimanus of secular history, BC 418. But <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/daniel/daniel-5.html#Da5_31">Daniel&nbsp;5:31</a>")</I> . <P><P><P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/ezra/4-21.html"><B>4&#058;21</B></a>&nbsp; Give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not builded, until another commandment shall be given from me. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>Give</span></B> <P>Chald. make a new decree. <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><!--pageCount=1-->
