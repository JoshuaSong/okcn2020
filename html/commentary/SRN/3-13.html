The anti-type as applied to the people of God is "sin," demanding self-judgment  <a href="/1-corinthians/11-31.html">1&nbsp;Corinthians 11:31</a>  and "sins," demanding confession and cleansing.  <a href="/1-john/1-9.html">1&nbsp;John 1:9</a> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/leviticus/13-3.html"><B>13&#058;3</B></a>&nbsp; And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh: and when the hair in the plague is turned white, and the plague in sight be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is a plague of leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>priest</span></B> <P>Some have found in the regulations of this chapter concerning an inquest by the priest of a case of leprosy, elaborate provisions for the exercise of discipline in the local church. No little self-righteousness and cruelty have come in thereby. The explicit instructions of the N.T. are the alone and sufficient rule of discipline. <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><!--pageCount=1-->
