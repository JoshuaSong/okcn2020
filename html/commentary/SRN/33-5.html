		<span><B>Chapter 5</B></span><P><a href="/micah/5-1.html"><B>5&#058;1</B></a>&nbsp; Now gather thyself in troops, O daughter of troops: he hath laid siege against us: they shall smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>Now</span></B> <P>The "word of the Lord that came to Micah"  <a href="/micah/4-1.html">Micah 4:1</a>  having described the future kingdom  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Micah+4:1-8">Micah 4:1-8</a>  and glanced at the Babylonian captivities  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Micah+4:9-10">Micah 4:9-10</a>  goes forward into the last days to refer to the great battle (see "Armageddon,")  <a href="/revelation/16-14.html">Revelation 16:14,</a>  <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/revelation/revelation-19.html#Re19_17">Revelation&nbsp;19:17</a>")</I> which immediately precedes the setting up of the Messianic kingdom (see "Kingdom (O.T.),"  <a href="/genesis/1-26.html">Genesis 1:26</a>  See Scofield " <a href="/zechariah/12-8.html">Zechariah 12:8</a> " also, "Kingdom (N.T.), ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Luke+1:31-33">Luke 1:31-33</a> ;  <a href="/1-corinthians/15-28.html">1&nbsp;Corinthians 15:28</a> . <P> <a href="/micah/5-1.html">Micah 5:1</a>  <a href="/micah/5-2.html">Micah 5:2</a>  forms a parenthesis in which the "word of the Lord" goes back from the time of the great battle (yet future) to the birth and rejection of the King, Messiah-Christ  <a href="/matthew/27-24.html">Matthew 27:24</a>  <a href="/matthew/27-25.html">Matthew 27:25</a>  <a href="/matthew/27-37.html">Matthew 27:37</a> . This is followed by the statement that He will "give them up until the time that she which travaileth hath brought forth" ( <a href="/micah/5-3.html">Micah 5:3</a> ). There is a twofold "travail" of Israel: <P>(1) that which brings forth the "man child" (Christ)  <a href="/revelation/12-1.html">Revelation 12:1</a>  <a href="/revelation/12-2.html">Revelation 12:2</a>  and <P>(2) that which, in the last days, brings forth a believing "remnant" out of the still dispersed and unbelieving nation  <a href="/micah/5-3.html">Micah 5:3</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Jeremiah+30:6-14">Jeremiah 30:6-14</a> ;  <a href="/micah/4-10.html">Micah 4:10</a> . Both aspects are combined in Isa. 66. In  <a href="/micah/5-7.html">Micah 5:7</a>  we have the "man-child" (Christ) of  <a href="/revelation/12-1.html">Revelation 12:1</a>  <a href="/revelation/12-2.html">Revelation 12:2</a>  in  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Micah+5:8-24">Micah 5:8-24</a>  the remnant, established in kingdom blessing. The meaning of  <a href="/micah/5-3.html">Micah 5:3</a>  is that, from the rejection of Christ at His first coming Jehovah will give Israel up till the believing remnant appears; then He stands and feeds in His proper strength as Jehovah ( <a href="/micah/5-4.html">Micah 5:4</a> ); He is the defence of His people as in  <a href="/micah/4-3.html">Micah 4:3</a>  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Micah+4:11-13">Micah 4:11-13</a>  and afterward the remnant go as missionaries to Israel and to all the world. ;  <a href="/micah/5-7.html">Micah 5:7</a>  <a href="/micah/5-8.html">Micah 5:8</a> ;  <a href="/zechariah/8-23.html">Zechariah 8:23</a> . <P><P><P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/micah/5-2.html"><B>5&#058;2</B></a>&nbsp; But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting.  <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>everlasting</span></B> <P>Cf.  <a href="/isaiah/7-13.html">Isaiah 7:13</a>  <a href="/isaiah/7-14.html">Isaiah 7:14</a> ;  <a href="/isaiah/9-6.html">Isaiah 9:6</a>  <a href="/isaiah/9-7.html">Isaiah 9:7</a> .

Turning to the Lord in the great tribulation  <a href="/psalms/2-5.html">Psalms 2:5</a> . See Scofield " <a href="/revelation/7-14.html">Revelation 7:14</a> ", the remnant takes up the beautiful gospel of the kingdom. See Scofield " <a href="/revelation/14-6.html">Revelation 14:6</a> " and proclaims it under awful persecution "unto all nations, for a witness."  <a href="/matthew/24-14.html">Matthew 24:14</a> . The result is seen in  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Revelation+7:4-14">Revelation 7:4-14</a>  This is the "dew" aspect, and is followed by the "day of the Lord" ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Isaiah+2:10-22">Isaiah 2:10-22</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Revelation+19:11-21">Revelation 19:11-21</a> . In the morning of which the kingdom is set up in power. Again there is a world-wide preaching to Jew and Gentile, but now it is the word that the King is on His holy hill of Zion (Psa. 2.), and the unrepentant will be broken with His rod of iron.  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Psalms+2:6-9">Psalms 2:6-9</a> . The preaching is given in  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Psalms+2:10-12">Psalms 2:10-12</a> . This is the "lion" aspect of the remnant's testimony.  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Revelation+2:26-28">Revelation 2:26-28</a> . The full kingdom-age of blessing follows the "rod of iron" aspect. <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><!--pageCount=1-->
