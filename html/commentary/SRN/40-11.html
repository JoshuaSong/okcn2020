Cf.  <a href="/john/15-20.html">John 15:20</a> ;  <a href="/isaiah/42-3.html">Isaiah 42:3</a> . <P><P><P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/matthew/11-11.html"><B>11&#058;11</B></a>&nbsp; Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><P><B><span>greater</span></B> <P>Positionally greater, not morally. John the Baptist was as great morally, as any man "born of woman," but as to the kingdom he but announced it at hand. The kingdom did not then come, but was rejected, and John was martyred, and the King presently crucified.

Both things are true. The King and His herald suffered violence, and this is the primary and greater meaning, but also, some were resolutely becoming disciples.

The places chosen for the testing of the nation, Chorazin, Bethsaida, etc. having rejected both John and Jesus, the rejected King now speaks of judgment. The final official rejection is later.  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Matthew+27:31-37">Matthew 27:31-37</a> . <P>For Another Point of View: See Topic 301190 <P>For Additional Factors See Topic 301199 <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/matthew/11-23.html"><B>11&#058;23</B></a>&nbsp; And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>hell</span></B> <P><I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/luke/luke-16.html#Lu16_23">Luke&nbsp;16:23</a>")</I> . <P><P><P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/matthew/11-27.html"><B>11&#058;27</B></a>&nbsp; All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>All things</span></B> <P>Kingdom, <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/matthew/matthew-12.html#Mt12_3">Matthew&nbsp;12:3</a>")</I> . <P><P><P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/matthew/11-28.html"><B>11&#058;28</B></a>&nbsp; Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>Come</span></B> <P>The new message of Jesus. The rejected King now turns from the rejecting nation and offers, not the kingdom, but rest and service to such in the nation as are conscious of the need. It is a pivotal point in the ministry of Jesus. <P><P><P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><!--pageCount=1-->
