		<span><B>Chapter 4</B></span><P><a href="/matthew/4-1.html"><B>4&#058;1</B></a>&nbsp; Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>Then was Jesus</span></B> <P>The temptation of Christ, the "last Adam"  <a href="/1-corinthians/15-45.html">1&nbsp;Corinthians 15:45</a>  is best understood when contrasted with that of the "first man Adam." Adam was tempted in his place of lord of creation, a lordship with but one reservation, the knowledge of good and evil ;  <a href="/genesis/1-26.html">Genesis 1:26</a> ;  <a href="/genesis/2-16.html">Genesis 2:16</a>  <a href="/genesis/2-17.html">Genesis 2:17</a> . Through the woman he was tempted to add that also to his dominion. Falling, he lost all. But Christ had taken the place of a lowly Servant, acting only from and in obedience to the Father. ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Philippians+2:5-8">Philippians 2:5-8</a> ;  <a href="/john/5-19.html">John 5:19</a> ;  <a href="/john/6-57.html"> 6:57</a> ;  <a href="/john/8-28.html">John 8:28</a>  <a href="/john/8-54.html">John 8:54</a>  <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/isaiah/isaiah-41.html#Isa41_8">Isaiah&nbsp;41:8</a>")</I> that He might redeem a fallen race and a creation under the curse ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Genesis+3:17-19">Genesis 3:17-19</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Romans+8:19-23">Romans 8:19-23</a> . Satan's one object in the threefold temptation was to induce Christ to act from Himself, in independency of His Father. The first two temptations were a challenge to Christ from the god of this world to prove Himself indeed the Son of God ( <a href="/matthew/4-3.html">Matthew 4:3</a>  <a href="/matthew/4-6.html">Matthew 4:6</a> ). The third was the offer of the usurping prince of this world to divest himself of that which rightfully belonged to Christ as Son of man and Son of David, on the condition that He accept the sceptre on Satan's world-principles (cf.  <a href="/john/18-36.html">John 18:36</a> ). See Scofield " <a href="/revelation/13-8.html">Revelation 13:8</a> ". Christ defeated Satan by a means open to His humblest follower, the intelligent use of the word of God ( <a href="/matthew/4-4.html">Matthew 4:4</a>  <a href="/matthew/4-7.html">Matthew 4:7</a> ). In his second temptation Satan also used Scripture, but a promise available only to one in the path of obedience. The scene give emphasis to the vital importance of "rightly dividing the word of truth"  <a href="/2-timothy/2-15.html">2&nbsp;Timothy 2:15</a> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/matthew/4-5.html"><B>4&#058;5</B></a>&nbsp; Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple, <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>holy city</span></B> <P>In the N.T. one Greek word, hagios, in its various forms, is rendered, "holy," "holiness," "sanctify," "sanctified," "sanctification."

The word for chaotic, unorganized humanity--the mere mass of man is thalassa, the "sea" of men (e.g.)  <a href="/revelation/13-1.html">Revelation 13:1</a>  <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/revelation/revelation-13.html#Re13_8">Revelation&nbsp;13:8</a>")</I> .

When Christ appeared to the Jewish people, the next thing in the order of revelation as it then stood, should have been the setting up of the Davidic kingdom. In the knowledge of God, not yet disclosed, lay the rejection of the kingdom (and King), the long period of the mystery-form of the kingdom, the world-wide preaching of the cross, and the out-calling of the Church. But this was as yet locked up in the secret counsels of God.  <a href="/matthew/13-11.html">Matthew 13:11</a>  <a href="/matthew/13-17.html">Matthew 13:17</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Ephesians+3:3-10">Ephesians 3:3-10</a> . <P><B><span>kingdom</span></B> See note 2, <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/matthew/matthew-5.html#Mt5_2">Matthew&nbsp;5:2</a>")</I> . <P><B><span>is at hand</span></B> <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/matthew/matthew-3.html#Mt3_2">Matthew&nbsp;3:2</a>")</I> .

He was, therefore, a cousin of the Lord Jesus. He is called James "the less"  <a href="/mark/15-40.html">Mark 15:40</a>  lit. little, i.e. of shorter stature than James the son of Zebedee). He was an apostle.  <a href="/matthew/10-3.html">Matthew 10:3</a>  It has been conjectured that "Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus"  <a href="/matthew/10-3.html">Matthew 10:3</a>  was identical with the Juda of  <a href="/luke/6-16.html">Luke 6:16</a>  who is there called "of [i.e. 'son' or 'brother' as is has been variously translated] James." A Juda is mentioned with a James and Joses and Simon in  <a href="/mark/6-3.html">Mark 6:3</a>  as "brother" of our Lord (See Scofield " <a href="/matthew/13-55.html">Matthew 13:55,</a>  marg.).  <a href="/matthew/13-55.html">Matthew 13:55</a> . The Gospels mention no other James who could be called the brother of the Lord Jesus, but James the less was certainly the son of Alphaeus and Mary the sister of our Lord's mother.
