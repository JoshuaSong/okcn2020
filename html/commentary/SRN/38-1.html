		<span><B>Chapter 1</B></span><P><a href="/zechariah/1-1.html"><B>1&#058;1</B></a>&nbsp; In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying, <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>eighth month</span></B> <P>i.e. November. <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/zechariah/1-7.html"><B>1&#058;7</B></a>&nbsp; Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying, <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>Sebat</span></B> <P>Eleventh month i.e. February. <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/zechariah/1-8.html"><B>1&#058;8</B></a>&nbsp; I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom; and behind him were there red horses, speckled, and white. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><P><B><span>I saw</span></B> <P>The "man" ( <a href="/zechariah/1-8.html">Zechariah 1:8</a> ) is the "my lord," "the angel that talked with me" ( <a href="/zechariah/1-9.html">Zechariah 1:9</a> ), and "the angel of the Lord" ( <a href="/zechariah/1-10.html">Zechariah 1:10</a>  <a href="/zechariah/1-11.html">Zechariah 1:11</a> ). The "man" "stood among the myrtle trees" ( <a href="/zechariah/1-8.html">Zechariah 1:8</a> ). The prophet addresses him as "my lord" (cf)  <a href="/genesis/19-2.html">Genesis 19:2</a>  but when the "man" answers he perceives that he has addressed an angel--"the angel that talked with me" ( <a href="/zechariah/1-9.html">Zechariah 1:9</a> ). In  <a href="/zechariah/1-10.html">Zechariah 1:10</a>  the being of the vision is again "the man that stood among the myrtle trees." In  <a href="/zechariah/1-11.html">Zechariah 1:11</a>  he is called "the angel of the Lord," and to him the (riders on the) "red horses, speckled with white" say: "We have walked to and fro," etc. Then ( <a href="/zechariah/1-12.html">Zechariah 1:12</a> ) "the angel of the Lord" (i.e. the "man," "my lord," "the angel that talked with me") intercedes for the land against a world at ease. The date of the intercession was at the end of the 70 years' captivity of Judah.  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Zechariah+1:9-12">Zechariah 1:9-12</a> . <P>Taken as a whole  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Zechariah+1:8-17">Zechariah 1:8-17</a>  Zechariah's first vision reveals Judah in dispersion; Jerusalem under adverse possession; and the Gentile nations at rest about it. This condition still continues, and Jehovah's answer to the intercession of the angel sweeps on to the end-time of Gentile domination, when "the Lord shall yet comfort Zion," etc. ( <a href="/zechariah/1-16.html">Zechariah 1:16</a>  <a href="/zechariah/1-17.html">Zechariah 1:17</a> ). <P> <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Isaiah+40:1-5">Isaiah 40:1-5</a> .
