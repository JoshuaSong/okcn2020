They were the spiritual ancestors of the prophets; that is to say, men raised up of God, the theocratic King, to represent Him in the nation. They were patriots and religious reformers because national security and prosperity were inseparably connected with loyalty and obedience to Jehovah. Not one of the chosen deliverers had anything whereof to glory in the flesh. Othniel was but the son of the younger brother of Caleb; Ehud was a left-handed man and an assassin; Shamgar, a rustic with an ox-goad; Deborah, a woman; Gideon, of an obscure family in the smallest tribe, etc. Each of the classes mentioned in  <a href="/1-corinthians/1-27.html">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>  <a href="/1-corinthians/1-28.html">1 Corinthians 1:28</a>  is illustrated among the judges. <P><P><P><B><span>repented</span></B> <P><I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/zechariah/zechariah-8.html#Zec8_14">Zechariah&nbsp;8:14</a>")</I> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><!--pageCount=1-->
