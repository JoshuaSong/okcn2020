		<span><B>Chapter 22</B></span><P><a href="/numbers/22-5.html"><B>22&#058;5</B></a>&nbsp; He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor, which is by the river of the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me: <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>Balaam</span></B> <P>Balaam is the typical hireling prophet, seeking only to make a market of his gift. This is "the way of Balaam"  <a href="/2-peter/2-15.html">2&nbsp;Peter 2:15</a>  and characterizes false teachers. The "error" of Balaam"  <a href="/jude/1-11.html">Jude 1:11</a>  was that he could see only the natural morality--a holy God, he reasoned, must curse such a people as Israel. Like all false teachers he was ignorant of the higher morality of vicarious atonement, by which God could be just and yet the justifier of believing sinners  <a href="/romans/3-26.html">Romans 3:26</a> . The "doctrine of Balaam"  <a href="/revelation/2-14.html">Revelation 2:14</a>  refers to his teaching Balak to corrupt the people whom he could not curse ;  <a href="/numbers/31-16.html">Numbers 31:16</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Numbers+25:1-3"> 25:1-3</a> ;  <a href="/james/4-4.html">James 4:4</a> . Spiritually, Balaamism in teaching never rises above natural reasonings; in practice, it is easy world- conformity.

Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><P><B><span>anger</span></B> <P>(Cf) <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/genesis/genesis-46.html#Ge46_3">Genesis&nbsp;46:3</a>")</I> . In  <a href="/numbers/22-12.html">Numbers 22:12</a>  the directive will of Jehovah is made known to Balaam, in  <a href="/numbers/22-20.html">Numbers 22:20</a>  Jehovah's permissive will. The prophet is now free to go, but knows the true mind of the Lord about it. The matter is wholly one between Jehovah and His servant. The permission of  <a href="/numbers/22-20.html">Numbers 22:20</a>  really constitutes a testing of Balaam. He chose the path of self-will and self- advantage, and Jehovah could not but gravely disapprove. The whole scene,  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Numbers+22:22-35">Numbers 22:22-35</a>  prepared Balaam for what was to follow. <P><B><span>angel</span></B> <P><I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/hebrews/hebrews-1.html#Heb1_4">Hebrews&nbsp;1:4</a>")</I>  <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/numbers/22-34.html"><B>22&#058;34</B></a>&nbsp; And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>angel</span></B> <P><I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/hebrews/hebrews-1.html#Heb1_4">Hebrews&nbsp;1:4</a>")</I>  <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/numbers/22-41.html"><B>22&#058;41</B></a>&nbsp; And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he might see the utmost part of the people. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>utmost</span></B> <P>"Utmost part," etc., means the end of the encampment, the "fourth part of Israel"  <a href="/numbers/23-10.html">Numbers 23:10</a> . Balak's thought, as Grant (following Keil) points out, was not at all to permit Balaam to see the whole of the Hebrew host. In bringing Balaam to Pisgah  <a href="/numbers/22-13.html">Numbers 22:13</a>  <a href="/numbers/22-14.html">Numbers 22:14</a> .

But when the hireling sees the whole camp he must utter a grander word than before, "He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob," and that with the nation in full view!
