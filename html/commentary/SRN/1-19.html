Lot was a great man  <a href="/deuteronomy/21-19.html">Deuteronomy 21:19</a>  <a href="/deuteronomy/21-20.html">Deuteronomy 21:20</a>  in a place devoted to judgment.

And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>And they said</span></B> <P>The world's contempt for a worldly believer. <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/genesis/19-14.html"><B>19&#058;14</B></a>&nbsp; And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>Lot</span></B> <P>Lot had utterly lost his testimony. In gaining influence  <a href="/genesis/19-1.html">Genesis 19:1</a>  he had lost power, even in his own family. <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/genesis/19-15.html"><B>19&#058;15</B></a>&nbsp; And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.  <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>angel</span></B> <P><I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/hebrews/hebrews-1.html#Heb1_4">Hebrews&nbsp;1:4</a>")</I> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/genesis/19-29.html"><B>19&#058;29</B></a>&nbsp; And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>when God</span></B> <P><I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/genesis/genesis-19.html#Ge19_36">Genesis&nbsp;19:36</a>")</I> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/genesis/19-32.html"><B>19&#058;32</B></a>&nbsp; Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>Come</span></B> <P>Lot "pitched toward Sodom"  <a href="/genesis/13-12.html">Genesis 13:12</a>  for worldly advantage; then became a great man in Sodom  <a href="/genesis/19-1.html">Genesis 19:1</a>  at the cost of his daughter's accepting the morals of Sodom. <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/genesis/19-36.html"><B>19&#058;36</B></a>&nbsp; Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>Thus were</span></B> <P>Abraham and Lot are contrasted characters.
