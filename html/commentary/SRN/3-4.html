		<span><B>Chapter 4</B></span><P><a href="/leviticus/4-3.html"><B>4&#058;3</B></a>&nbsp; If the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the people; then let him bring for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish unto the LORD for a sin offering. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>sin-offering</span></B> <P>The sin-offering, though still Christ, is Christ seen laden with the believer's sin, absolutely in the sinner's place and stead, and not, as in the sweet savour offerings, in His own perfections. It is Christ's death as viewed in  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Isaiah+53:1-12">Isaiah 53:1-12</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Psalms+22:1-31">Psalms 22:1-31</a> ;  <a href="/matthew/26-28.html">Matthew 26:28</a> ;  <a href="/1-peter/2-24.html">1&nbsp;Peter 2:24</a> ;  <a href="/1-peter/3-18.html"> 3:18</a> . <P>But note  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Leviticus+6:24-30">Leviticus 6:24-30</a>  how the essential holiness of Him who was "made sin for us"  <a href="/2-corinthians/5-21.html">2&nbsp;Corinthians 5:21</a>  is guarded. The sin-offerings are expiatory, substitutional, efficacious  <a href="/leviticus/4-12.html">Leviticus 4:12</a>  <a href="/leviticus/4-29.html">Leviticus 4:29</a>  <a href="/leviticus/4-35.html">Leviticus 4:35</a>  and have in view the vindication of the law through substitutional sacrifice. <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/leviticus/4-12.html"><B>4&#058;12</B></a>&nbsp; Even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn him on the wood with fire: where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt.  <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>without the camp</span></B> <P>Cf.  <a href="/exodus/29-14.html">Exodus 29:14</a> ;  <a href="/leviticus/16-27.html">Leviticus 16:27</a> ;  <a href="/numbers/19-3.html">Numbers 19:3</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Hebrews+13:10-13">Hebrews 13:10-13</a> . The last passage is the interpretative one. The "camp" was Judaism-- a religion of forms and ceremonies. "Jesus, also, that He might sanctify separate, or set apart for God] the people with or 'through' His own blood, suffered without the gate" temple gate, city gate, i.e. Judaism civil and religious];  <a href="/hebrews/13-12.html">Hebrews 13:12</a>  but how does this sanctify, or set apart, a people? "Let us go forth therefore unto Him without the camp Judaism then, Judaized Christianity now--anything religious which denies Him as our sin-offering] bearing His reproach"  <a href="/hebrews/13-13.html">Hebrews 13:13</a> . The sin- offering, "burned without the camp," typifies this aspect of the death of Christ. The cross becomes a new altar, in a new place, where, without the smallest merit in themselves, the redeemed gather to offer, as believer-priests, spiritual sacrifices. ;  <a href="/hebrews/13-15.html">Hebrews 13:15</a> ;  <a href="/1-peter/2-5.html">1&nbsp;Peter 2:5</a> . The bodies of the sin-offering beasts were not burned without the camp, as some have fancied, because "saturated with sin," and unfit for a holy camp. Rather, an unholy camp was an unfit place for a holy sin-offering. The dead body of our Lord was not "saturated with sin," though in it our sins had been borne  <a href="/1-peter/2-24.html">1&nbsp;Peter 2:24</a> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/leviticus/4-20.html"><B>4&#058;20</B></a>&nbsp; And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock for a sin offering, so shall he do with this: and the priest shall make an atonement for them, and it shall be forgiven them. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>atonement</span></B> <P><I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/exodus/exodus-29.html#Ex29_33">Exodus&nbsp;29:33</a>")</I> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/leviticus/4-26.html"><B>4&#058;26</B></a>&nbsp; And he shall burn all his fat upon the altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall make an atonement for him as concerning his sin, and it shall be forgiven him. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>atonement</span></B> <P><I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/exodus/exodus-29.html#Ex29_33">Exodus&nbsp;29:33</a>")</I>  <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><!--pageCount=1-->
