Summary: In the O.T. "righteous" and "just" are English words used to translate the Hebrew words yasher, "upright"; tsadiq, "just"; tsidkah, "righteous." In all of these words but one idea inheres: the righteous, or just, man is so called, because he is right with God; and he is right with God because he has walked "in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless"  <a href="/luke/1-6.html">Luke 1:6</a> ;  <a href="/romans/10-5.html">Romans 10:5</a> ;  Philemon 3:6 . The O.T. righteous man was not sinless  <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-20.html">Ecclesiastes 7:20,</a>  but one who, for all his sins, resorted to the ordinances, and offered in faith the required sacrifice (e.g.)  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Leviticus+4:27-35">Leviticus 4:27-35</a>  CF.
