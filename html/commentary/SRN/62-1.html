"All things. . .are made manifest by the light"  <a href="/ephesians/5-13.html">Ephesians 5:13</a>  The presence of God brings the consciousness of sin in the nature  <a href="/1-john/1-8.html">1&nbsp;John 1:8</a>  and sins in the life  <a href="/1-john/1-9.html">1 John 1:9</a>  <a href="/1-john/1-10.html">1 John 1:10</a> . The blood of Christ is the divine provision for both. To walk in the light is to live in fellowship with the Father and the Son. Sin interrupts, but confession restores that fellowship. Immediate confession keeps the fellowship unbroken. <P><B><span>light</span></B> <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/exodus/exodus-27.html#Ex27_20">Exodus&nbsp;27:20</a>")</I>  <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><!--pageCount=1-->
