		<span><B>Chapter 14</B></span><P><a href="/genesis/14-14.html"><B>14&#058;14</B></a>&nbsp; And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.  <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>when Abram</span></B> <P>It is Abram the separated man who has power to help. See  <a href="/genesis/19-29.html">Genesis 19:29</a> ;  <a href="/2-timothy/2-20.html">2 Timothy 2:20</a>  <a href="/2-timothy/2-21.html">2 Timothy 2:21</a>  <P><P><P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/genesis/14-18.html"><B>14&#058;18</B></a>&nbsp; And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><P><P><B><span>Melchizedek</span></B> <P>1 Melchizedek, type of Christ the King-Priest. The type strictly applies to the priestly work of Christ in resurrection, since Melchizedek presents only the memorials of sacrifice, bread and wine. "After the order of Melchizedek"  <a href="/hebrews/6-20.html">Hebrews 6:20</a>  refers to the royal authority and unending duration of Christ's high priesthood  <a href="/hebrews/7-23.html">Hebrews 7:23</a>  <a href="/hebrews/7-24.html">Hebrews 7:24</a> . The Aaronic priesthood was often interrupted by death. Christ is a priest after the order of Melchizedek, as King of righteousness, King of peace ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Isaiah+11:4-9">Isaiah 11:4-9</a> ;  <a href="/hebrews/7-2.html">Hebrews 7:2</a>  and in the endlessness of his priesthood; but the Aaronic priesthood typifies His priestly work. <P><B><span>most high God</span></B> <P>2 "Most high," or "most high God" (Heb. El Elyon). "Elyon means simply "highest." <P>(1) The first revelation of this name ( <a href="/genesis/14-8.html">Genesis 14:8</a> ) indicates its distinctive meanings. Abram, returning from his victory over the confederated kings  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Genesis+14:1-17">Genesis 14:1-17</a>  is met by Melchizedek, King of Salem. . . the "priest of the most high God" (El Elyon), who blesses Abram in the name of El Elyon, "possessor of heaven and earth." This revelation produced a remarkable impression upon the patriarch. Not only did he at once give Melchizedek "tithes of all" the spoil of the battle, but when the King of Sodom offered other of that spoil to Abram, his answer was; "I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord Jehovah, the most high God El-Elyon, the possessor of heaven and earth, that I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet," etc.  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Genesis+14:18-23">Genesis 14:18-23</a> . <P>(a) The Lord (Jehovah) is know to a Gentile king (Melchizedek) by the name "most high god" El Elyon); <P>(b) a Gentile is the priest of El Elyon and <P>(c) His distinctive character as most high God is "possessor of heaven and earth." <P>Appropriately to this Gentile knowledge of God by His name "Most High," we read that "the Most High divided to the nations i.e. Gentiles] their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam," etc.  <a href="/deuteronomy/32-8.html">Deuteronomy 32:8</a> . As "possessor heaven and earth," it was the prerogative of the Most High to distribute the earth among the nations according to whatever principle He chose. That principle is declared  <a href="/deuteronomy/32-8.html">Deuteronomy 32:8</a> . To the same purport is the use of the name in Daniel, the book of Gentile prophecy ;  <a href="/daniel/3-26.html">Daniel 3:26</a> ;  <a href="/daniel/4-17.html">Daniel 4:17</a>  <a href="/daniel/4-24.html">Daniel 4:24</a>  <a href="/daniel/4-25.html">Daniel 4:25</a>  <a href="/daniel/4-32.html">Daniel 4:32</a>  <a href="/daniel/4-34.html">Daniel 4:34</a>  <a href="/daniel/4-35.html">Daniel 4:35</a> ;  <a href="/daniel/5-18.html">Daniel 5:18</a>  <a href="/daniel/5-21.html">Daniel 5:21</a> . <P>(2) As "possessor of heaven and earth," the most high God has and exercises authority in both spheres: <P>(a) the heavenly authority of El Elyon (e.g.  <a href="/daniel/4-35.html">Daniel 4:35</a>  <a href="/daniel/4-37.html">Daniel 4:37</a> ;  <a href="/isaiah/14-13.html">Isaiah 14:13</a>  <a href="/isaiah/14-14.html">Isaiah 14:14</a> ;  <a href="/matthew/28-18.html">Matthew 28:18</a>  <P>(b) the earthly authority of El Elyon (e.g).  <a href="/deuteronomy/32-8.html">Deuteronomy 32:8</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Psalms+9:2-5">Psalms 9:2-5</a> ;  <a href="/psalms/21-7.html"> 21:7</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Psalms+47:2-4"> 47:2-4</a> ;  <a href="/psalms/56-2.html">Psalms 56:2</a>  Psalms 382:6  <a href="/psalms/56-8.html">Psalms 56:8</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Psalms+83:16-18"> 83:16-18</a>  ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Psalms+91:9-12"> 91:9-12</a> ;  <a href="/2-samuel/22-14.html">2 Samuel 22:14</a>  <a href="/2-samuel/22-15.html">2 Samuel 22:15</a> ;  <a href="/daniel/5-18.html">Daniel 5:18</a>  <P>See, for other names of Deity: <P><I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/genesis/genesis-1.html#Ge1_1">Genesis&nbsp;1:1</a>")</I> See Scofield " <a href="/genesis/2-4.html">Genesis 2:4</a> " <P> <a href="/genesis/2-7.html">Genesis 2:7</a>  <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/genesis/genesis-15.html#Ge15_2">Genesis&nbsp;15:2</a>")</I>  <P><I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/genesis/genesis-17.html#Ge17_1">Genesis&nbsp;17:1</a>")</I> See Scofield " <a href="/genesis/21-33.html">Genesis 21:33</a> " <P><I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/1-samuel/1-samuel-1.html#1Sa1_3">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;1:3</a>")</I>  <P><B><span>Melchizedek</span></B> Meaning King of Righteousness.
