It includes the ruins of Petra, and is bounded on the north by Moab. Peopled by descendants of Esau  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Genesis+36:1-9">Genesis 36:1-9</a> . Edom has a remarkable prominence in the prophetic word as (together with Moab) the scene of the final destruction of Gentile world-power in the day of the Lord. See "Armageddon" ;  <a href="/revelation/16-14.html">Revelation 16:14</a> ;  <a href="/revelation/19-21.html">Revelation 19:21</a>  and "Times of the Gentiles" ;  <a href="/luke/21-24.html">Luke 21:24</a> ;  <a href="/revelation/16-14.html">Revelation 16:14</a> .

The principle is stated in  <a href="/1-corinthians/15-46.html">1&nbsp;Corinthians 15:46</a> . First things are "natural," man's best, and always fail; second things are "spiritual," God's things, and succeed. Adam--Christ; Cain--Abel; Cain's posterity--Seth's posterity; Saul--David; Israel--the true Church, etc. <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><!--pageCount=1-->
