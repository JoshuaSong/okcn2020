		<span><B>Chapter 14</B></span><P><a href="/revelation/14-1.html"><B>14&#058;1</B></a>&nbsp; And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's name written in their foreheads. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>written in</span></B> <P>See,  <a href="/revelation/7-3.html">Revelation 7:3</a> ;  <a href="/revelation/22-4.html"> 22:4</a>  contra:  <a href="/revelation/13-16.html">Revelation 13:16</a> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/revelation/14-4.html"><B>14&#058;4</B></a>&nbsp; These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were redeemed from among men, being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>redeemed</span></B> <P><I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/romans/romans-3.html#Ro3_24">Romans&nbsp;3:24</a>")</I> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/revelation/14-6.html"><B>14&#058;6</B></a>&nbsp; And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, <BLOCKQUOTE><P><P><B><span>gospel</span></B> <P>Gospel. This great theme may be summarized as follows: <P>I. In itself the word Gospel means good news. <P>II. Four forms of the Gospel are to be distinguished" <P>(1) The Gospel of the kingdom. This is the good news that God purposes to set up on the earth, in fulfilment of the Davidic Covenant  <a href="/2-samuel/7-16.html">2&nbsp;Samuel 7:16</a>  a kingdom, political, spiritual, Israelitish, universal, over which God's Son, David's heir, shall be King, and which shall be, for one thousand years, the manifestation of the righteousness of God in human affairs. <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/matthew/matthew-3.html#Mt3_2">Matthew&nbsp;3:2</a>")</I> . <P>Two preachings of this Gospel are mentioned, one past, beginning with the ministry of John the Baptist, continued by our Lord and His disciples, and ending with the Jewis rejection of the King. The other is yet future  <a href="/matthew/24-14.html">Matthew 24:14</a>  during the great tribulation, and immediately preceding the coming of the King in glory. <P>(2) The Gospel of the grace of God. This is the good news that Jesus Christ, the rejected King, has died on the cross for the sins of the world, that He was raised from the dead for our justification, and that by Him all that believe are justified from all things. This form of the Gospel is described in many ways. It is the Gospel "of God"  <a href="/romans/1-1.html">Romans 1:1</a>  because it originates in His love; "of Christ"  <a href="/2-corinthians/10-14.html">2&nbsp;Corinthians 10:14</a>  because it flows from His sacrifice, and because He is the alone Object of Gospel faith; of the "grace of God"  <a href="/acts/20-24.html">Acts 20:24</a>  because it saves those whom the law curses; of "the glory" ;  <a href="/1-timothy/1-11.html">1&nbsp;Timothy 1:11</a> ;  <a href="/2-corinthians/4-4.html">2&nbsp;Corinthians 4:4</a>  because it concerns Him who is in the glory, and who is bringing the many sons to glory  <a href="/hebrews/2-10.html">Hebrews 2:10</a>  of "our salvation"  <a href="/ephesians/1-13.html">Ephesians 1:13</a>  because it is the "power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth"  <a href="/romans/1-16.html">Romans 1:16</a>  of "the uncircumcision"  <a href="/galatians/2-7.html">Galatians 2:7</a>  because it saves wholly apart from forms and ordinances of "peace"  <a href="/ephesians/6-15.html">Ephesians 6:15</a>  because through Christ it makes peace between the sinner and God, and imparts inward peace. <P>(3) The everlasting Gospel  <a href="/revelation/14-6.html">Revelation 14:6</a> . This is to be preached to the earth-dwellers at the very end of the great tribulation and immediately preceding the judgment of the nations  <a href="/matthew/15-31.html">Matthew 15:31</a> . It is neither the Gospel of the kingdom, nor of grace. Though its burden is judgment, not salvation, it is good news to Israel and to those who, during the tribulation, have been saved ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Revelation+7:9-14">Revelation 7:9-14</a> ;  <a href="/luke/21-28.html">Luke 21:28</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Psalms+96:11-13">Psalms 96:11-13</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Isaiah+35:4-10">Isaiah 35:4-10</a> . <P>(4) That which Paul calls, "my Gospel"  <a href="/romans/2-16.html">Romans 2:16</a> . This is the Gospel of the grace of God in its fullest development, but includes the revelation of the result of that Gospel in the outcalling of the church, her relationships, position, privileges, and responsibility. It is the distinctive truth of Ephesians and Colossians, but interpenetrates all of Paul's writings. <P>III. There is "another Gospel"  <a href="/galatians/1-6.html">Galatians 1:6</a> ;  <a href="/2-corinthians/11-4.html">2&nbsp;Corinthians 11:4</a>  "which is not another," but a perversion of the Gospel of the grace of God, against which we are warned. It has many seductive forms, but the test is one--it invariably denies the sufficiency of grace alone to save, keep, and perfect, and mingles with grace some kind of human merit. In Galatia it was law, in Colosse fanaticism  <a href="/colossians/2-18.html">Colossians 2:18,</a>  etc. In any form its teachers lie under the awful anathema of God. <P><B><span>angel</span></B> <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/hebrews/hebrews-1.html#Heb1_4">Hebrews&nbsp;1:4</a>")</I> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/revelation/14-8.html"><B>14&#058;8</B></a>&nbsp; And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>angel</span></B> <P><I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/hebrews/hebrews-1.html#Heb1_4">Hebrews&nbsp;1:4</a>")</I> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/revelation/14-9.html"><B>14&#058;9</B></a>&nbsp; And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>angel</span></B> <P><I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/hebrews/hebrews-1.html#Heb1_4">Hebrews&nbsp;1:4</a>")</I>  <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/revelation/14-10.html"><B>14&#058;10</B></a>&nbsp; The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb: <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>angels</span></B> <P><I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/hebrews/hebrews-1.html#Heb1_4">Hebrews&nbsp;1:4</a>")</I> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/revelation/14-11.html"><B>14&#058;11</B></a>&nbsp; And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>no rest</span></B> <P>Contra,  <a href="/revelation/4-8.html">Revelation 4:8</a> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/revelation/14-14.html"><B>14&#058;14</B></a>&nbsp; And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>like unto the Son</span></B> <P>Cf.  <a href="/matthew/26-64.html">Matthew 26:64,</a>  Contra,  <a href="/1-thessalonians/4-16.html">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>  <a href="/1-thessalonians/4-17.html">1 Thessalonians 4:17</a>  <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/revelation/14-15.html"><B>14&#058;15</B></a>&nbsp; And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.  <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>angel</span></B> <P><I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/hebrews/hebrews-1.html#Heb1_4">Hebrews&nbsp;1:4</a>")</I> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/revelation/14-17.html"><B>14&#058;17</B></a>&nbsp; And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>angel</span></B> <P><I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/hebrews/hebrews-1.html#Heb1_4">Hebrews&nbsp;1:4</a>")</I> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/revelation/14-18.html"><B>14&#058;18</B></a>&nbsp; And another angel came out from the altar, which had power over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>angel</span></B> <P><I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/hebrews/hebrews-1.html#Heb1_4">Hebrews&nbsp;1:4</a>")</I> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/revelation/14-19.html"><B>14&#058;19</B></a>&nbsp; And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>angel</span></B> <P><I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/hebrews/hebrews-1.html#Heb1_4">Hebrews&nbsp;1:4</a>")</I>  <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><!--pageCount=1-->
