		<span><B>Chapter 2</B></span><P><a href="/song-of-solomon/2-2.html"><B>2&#058;2</B></a>&nbsp; As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>so is</span></B> <P>How poor are the similes of the bride as compared with those of the Bridegroom. To Him she is a "lily among thorns; she can only say that He is "as the apple tree among the trees of the wood." <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/song-of-solomon/2-9.html"><B>2&#058;9</B></a>&nbsp; My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he standeth behind our wall, he looketh forth at the windows, shewing himself through the lattice. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>our wall</span></B> <P>"Our wall." The bride had returned to her own home: the Bridegroom seeks her. <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/song-of-solomon/2-14.html"><B>2&#058;14</B></a>&nbsp; O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>dove</span></B> <P>There is beautiful order here. First we have what the bride is as seen in Christ, "My dove." In herself most faulty; in Him "blameless and harmless"  <a href="/philippians/2-15.html">Philippians 2:15</a>  the very character of the dove. The bride's place of safety, "in the clefts of the rock"--hidden, so to speak, in the wounds of Christ. Thirdly, her privilege. "Stairs" speaks of access. It is not "secret places," as in A.V., but "the secret of the stairs"--the way and privilege of access to His presence ;  <a href="/ephesians/2-18.html">Ephesians 2:18</a> ;  <a href="/colossians/3-1.html">Colossians 3:1</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Hebrews+10:19-22">Hebrews 10:19-22</a> . Fourthly, the order of approach: she is to come near before she speaks, "Let me see thy countenance," then "Let me hear thy voice." Lastly, now that she is near and has spoken, He speaks a tender word of admonition: "Take us the foxes," etc. <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><!--pageCount=1-->
