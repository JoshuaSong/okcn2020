Certain dates are mentioned (e.g.  <a href="/jeremiah/32-1.html">Jeremiah 32:1</a> ;  <a href="/jeremiah/33-1.html"> 33:1</a> ;  <a href="/jeremiah/34-1.html">Jeremiah 34:1</a>  <a href="/jeremiah/34-8.html">Jeremiah 34:8</a> ;  <a href="/jeremiah/35-1.html"> 35:1</a>  but retrospectively. The narrative, so far as Jeremiah gives a narrative, is resumed at  <a href="/jeremiah/37-1.html">Jeremiah 37:1</a> . These chapters constitute a kind of summary of prophecy concerning Israel as a nation, looking on especially to the last days, the day of the Lord, and the kingdom-age to follow. If the marginal references are carefully followed the order will become clear. But these prophecies are interspersed with much historical matter concerning Jeremiah and his time. <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/jeremiah/30-2.html"><B>30&#058;2</B></a>&nbsp; Thus speaketh the LORD God of Israel, saying, Write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>Write</span></B> <P>Three "writings" by Jeremiah are to be distinguished: <P>(1) This is impersonal--a general prophecy, and probably the earliest.  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Jeremiah+30:1-24;Jeremiah+30:40">Jeremiah 30:1-31:40</a> . <P>(2) The prophecy destroyed by Jehoiakim.  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Jeremiah+1:1-19;Jeremiah+1:23">Jeremiah 1:1-36:23</a> . <P>(3) The destroyed writing re-written doubtless the writing preserved to us.  <a href="/jeremiah/36-27.html">Jeremiah 36:27</a> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/jeremiah/30-6.html"><B>30&#058;6</B></a>&nbsp; Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child? wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness? <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>travail</span></B> <P><I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/micah/micah-5.html#Mic5_1">Micah&nbsp;5:1</a>")</I> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><!--pageCount=1-->
