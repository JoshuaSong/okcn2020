		<span><B>Chapter 11</B></span><P><a href="/daniel/11-2.html"><B>11&#058;2</B></a>&nbsp; And now will I shew thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than they all: and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of Grecia. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><P>The spirit of prophecy here returns to that which more immediately concerned Daniel and his royal masters--the near future of the empire in which he was so great a personage. Four kings were yet to follow in Media-Persia. Then will come Alexander the "mighty king" of Grecia (v.3). The division of Alexander's empire into four parts (v.4) as already predicted  <a href="/daniel/8-22.html">Daniel 8:22</a>  is foretold. The troublous course of affairs in two parts of the disintegrated Alexandrian empire, Syria and Egypt, is then traced down to verse 20. Here Antiochus Epiphanes, the "little horn" of Chapter 8., occupies the vision down to verse 36. His pollution of the sanctuary is again mentioned. (Cf) <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/daniel/daniel-8.html#Da8_9">Daniel&nbsp;8:9</a>")</I> .

Syria and Egypt, to the time of Antiochus Epiphanes, and having described his career, overleaps the centuries to "the time of the end," when he of whom Antiochus Epiphanes was a type, the "little horn" of  <a href="/daniel/7-8.html">Daniel 7:8</a>  the "Beast out of the sea" of  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Revelation+13:4-10">Revelation 13:4-10</a>  shall appear (cf) <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/daniel/daniel-7.html#Da7_8">Daniel&nbsp;7:8</a>")</I> . Prophecy does not concern itself with history as such, but only with history as it affects Israel and the Holy Land. Antiochus Epiphanes was insignificant as compared with historical personages whom the Bible does not mention, but he scourged the covenant people and defiled God's altar, thus coming into prophetic light. From verse 36 the "little horn" of  <a href="/daniel/7-8.html">Daniel 7:8</a>  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Daniel+7:24-26">Daniel 7:24-26</a>  fills the scene. His prosperity lasts until "the indignation" (the "time of trouble" of ;  <a href="/daniel/12-1.html">Daniel 12:1</a> ;  <a href="/matthew/24-21.html">Matthew 24:21</a>  is accomplished ( <a href="/daniel/11-36.html">Daniel 11:36</a> ). This is parallel with ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Revelation+17:10-14">Revelation 17:10-14</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Revelation+19:19-21"> 19:19-21</a> .  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Daniel+11:37-45">Daniel 11:37-45</a>  supply details not mentioned in the N.T. The expression "God of his fathers" ( <a href="/daniel/11-37.html">Daniel 11:37</a> ) has been held to indicate that the "king" is an apostate Jew, but this does not accord with  <a href="/daniel/9-26.html">Daniel 9:26</a>  which was fulfilled by the Gentile armies of Rome. The "little horn" is an apostate, but from Christianity, not Judaism (cf)  <a href="/1-john/2-18.html">1 John 2:18</a>  <a href="/1-john/2-19.html">1 John 2:19</a> .  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Daniel+11:38-45">Daniel 11:38-45</a>  describe his career. Substituting "the god of forces" (i.e. forces of nature) for the true God ( <a href="/daniel/11-38.html">Daniel 11:38</a>  <a href="/daniel/11-39.html">Daniel 11:39</a> ), he soon presents himself as that god (cf)  <a href="/2-thessalonians/2-3.html">2 Thessalonians 2:3</a>  <a href="/2-thessalonians/2-4.html">2 Thessalonians 2:4</a> . While his career lasts he is an irresistible conqueror  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Daniel+11:40-44">Daniel 11:40-44</a> ). He established his palace in Jerusalem, probably at the time of his supreme act of blasphemous impiety ;  <a href="/daniel/9-27.html">Daniel 9:27</a> ;  <a href="/daniel/12-11.html"> 12:11</a> ;  <a href="/matthew/24-15.html">Matthew 24:15</a> ;  <a href="/2-thessalonians/2-4.html">2&nbsp;Thessalonians 2:4</a> .
