These assemblies were not destitute of elders; but were "wanting," in that they were not duly appointed. There is a progress of doctrine in respect of the appointing of elders. Cf. v. 5, note. <P><B><span>elders</span></B> <P>Elder (presbuteros) and bishop (episcopos = "overseer") designate the same office (cf  <a href="/titus/1-7.html">Titus 1:7</a> ;  <a href="/acts/20-17.html">Acts 20:17</a> ;  <a href="/acts/20-28.html"> 20:28</a>  the former referring to the man, the latter to a function of the office. The eldership in the apostolic local churches was always plural. There is no instance of one elder in a local church. The functions of the elders are: to rule ;  <a href="/1-timothy/3-4.html">1 Timothy 3:4</a>  <a href="/1-timothy/3-5.html">1 Timothy 3:5</a> ;  <a href="/1-timothy/5-17.html"> 5:17</a>  to guard the body of revealed truth from perversion and error  <a href="/titus/1-9.html">Titus 1:9</a>  to "oversee" the church as a shepherd his flock ;  <a href="/acts/20-28.html">Acts 20:28</a> ;  <a href="/john/21-16.html">John 21:16</a> ;  <a href="/hebrews/13-17.html">Hebrews 13:17</a> .  <a href="/1-peter/5-2.html">1&nbsp;Peter 5:2</a> .
