		<span><B>Chapter 10</B></span><P><a href="/leviticus/10-1.html"><B>10&#058;1</B></a>&nbsp; And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered strange fire before the LORD, which he commanded them not. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><P>Strange fire. Fire "from before the Lord" had kindled upon the altar of burnt-offering the fire which the care of the priests was to keep burning  <a href="/leviticus/6-12.html">Leviticus 6:12</a> . No commandment had yet been given  <a href="/leviticus/16-12.html">Leviticus 16:12</a>  how the incense should be kindled. The sin of Nadab and Abihu was in acting in the things of God without seeking the mind of God. It was "will worship"  <a href="/colossians/2-23.html">Colossians 2:23</a>  which often has a "show of wisdom and humility." It typifies any use of carnal means to kindle the fire of devotion and praise. <P><P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/leviticus/10-4.html"><B>10&#058;4</B></a>&nbsp; And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Come near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><P>Mish-a-el, 'one with God.'
