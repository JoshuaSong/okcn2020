And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me these things. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>angel</span></B> <P><I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/hebrews/hebrews-1.html#Heb1_4">Hebrews&nbsp;1:4</a>")</I> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/revelation/22-11.html"><B>22&#058;11</B></a>&nbsp; He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><P>See definitions O.T. righteousness  <a href="/luke/2-25.html">Luke 2:25</a>  N.T. righteousness <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/romans/romans-3.html#Ro3_21">Romans&nbsp;3:21</a>")</I> ,  <a href="/romans/10-10.html">Romans 10:10</a>  righteous living  <a href="/1-john/3-7.html">1&nbsp;John 3:7</a>  self-righteousness  <a href="/romans/10-3.html">Romans 10:3</a> . <P><B><span>holy</span></B> <P>Sanctification, holiness, Summary: <P>(1) In both Testaments the same Hebrew and Greek words are rendered by the English works "sanctify" and "holy," in their various grammatical forms. The one uniform meaning is, "to set apart for God." <P>(2) In both Testaments the words are used of "things" and "persons". <P>(3) When used of things no moral quality is implied; they are sanctified or made holy because set apart for God. <P>(4) Sanctification when used of persons has a threefold meaning. <P>(a) In position, believers are eternally set apart for God by redemption, "through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once"  <a href="/hebrews/10-9.html">Hebrews 10:9</a>  <a href="/hebrews/10-10.html">Hebrews 10:10</a> . Positionally, therefore, believers are "saints" and "holy" from the moment of believing ;  <a href="/philippians/1-1.html">Philippians 1:1</a> ;  <a href="/hebrews/3-1.html">Hebrews 3:1</a> . <P>(b) In experience, the believer is being sanctified by the work of the Holy Spirit through the Scriptures  <a href="/john/17-17.html">John 17:17</a> ;  <a href="/2-corinthians/3-18.html">2&nbsp;Corinthians 3:18</a> ;  <a href="/ephesians/5-25.html">Ephesians 5:25</a>  <a href="/ephesians/5-26.html">Ephesians 5:26</a> ;  <a href="/1-thessalonians/5-23.html">1 Thessalonians 5:23</a>  <a href="/1-thessalonians/5-24.html">1 Thessalonians 5:24</a>  <P>(c) In consummation, the believer's complete sanctification awaits the appearing of the Lord  <a href="/ephesians/5-27.html">Ephesians 5:27</a> ;  <a href="/1-john/3-2.html">1&nbsp;John 3:2</a>  See "Salvation," <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/romans/romans-1.html#Ro1_16">Romans&nbsp;1:16</a>")</I> . <P><P><P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/revelation/22-19.html"><B>22&#058;19</B></a>&nbsp; And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><P>Inspiration: Summary. The testimony of the Bible to itself. <P>(1) The writers affirm, where they speak of the subject at all, they speak by direct divine authority. <P>(2) They invariably testify that the words, and not the ideas merely, are inspired. The most important passage is  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=1 Corinthians+2:7-15">1&nbsp;Corinthians 2:7-15</a>  which see. <P>(3) The whole attitude of Jesus Christ toward the Old Testament, as disclosed in His words, both before His death and after His resurrection, confirms its truth and divine origin, and He explicitly ascribes the Pentateuch to Moses. <P>(4) In promising subsequent revelations after the predicted advent of the Spirit  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=John+16:12-15">John 16:12-15</a>  our Lord prepared the way for the New Testament. <P>(5) The writers of the New Testament invariably treat the Old Testament as authoritative and inspired. <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/2-peter/2-peter-1.html#2Pe1_19">2&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;1:19</a>")</I> . See Scofield " <a href="/1-corinthians/2-13.html">1&nbsp;Corinthians 2:13</a> ". <P><B><span>life</span></B> Eternal life, Summary of the teaching: <P>(1) The life is called "eternal" because it was from the eternity which is past unto the eternity which is to come--it is the life of God revealed in Jesus Christ, who is God  <a href="/john/1-4.html">John 1:4</a> ;  <a href="/john/5-26.html"> 5:26</a> ;  <a href="/1-john/1-1.html">1 John 1:1</a>  <a href="/1-john/1-2.html">1 John 1:2</a>  <P>(2) This life of God, which was revealed in Christ, is imparted in a new birth by the Holy Spirit, acting upon the word of God, to every believer on the Lord Jesus Christ  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=John+3:3-15">John 3:3-15</a> . <P>(3) The life thus imparted was from the beginning."
