		<span><B>Chapter 1</B></span><P><a href="/1-samuel/1-3.html"><B>1&#058;3</B></a>&nbsp; And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were there. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>Lord of hosts</span></B> <P>Jehovah (Lord) of Hosts, Heb. Jehovah Sabaoth. For the distinctive meanings of Jehovah, <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/genesis/genesis-2.html#Ge2_4">Genesis&nbsp;2:4</a>")</I> . Sabaoth means simply host or hosts, but with especial reference to warfare or service. In use the two ideas are united; Jehovah is LORD of (warrior) hosts. It is the name, therefore, of Jehovah in manifestation of power. "The Lord of Hosts, He is the King of glory"  <a href="/psalms/24-10.html">Psalms 24:10</a>  and accordingly in the Old Testament Scripture this name is revealed in the time of Israel's need. It is never found in the Pentateuch, nor directly in Joshua or Judges, and occurs but rarely in the Psalms; but Jeremiah, the prophet of approaching national judgment, uses the name about eighty times. Haggai in two chapters uses the name fourteen times, Zechariah in fourteen chapters calls upon the Lord of hosts about fifty times. In Malachi the name occurs about twenty five times. In the utmost extremity, the Psalmist twice comforts his heart with the assurance "the Lord of hosts is with us."  <a href="/psalms/46-7.html">Psalms 46:7</a>  <a href="/psalms/46-11.html">Psalms 46:11</a> . <P>The meanings and uses of this name may thus be summarized: <P>(1) The "hosts" are heavenly. Primarily the angels are meant, but the name gathers into itself the idea of all divine or heavenly power as available for the need of God's people  <a href="/genesis/32-1.html">Genesis 32:1</a>  <a href="/genesis/32-2.html">Genesis 32:2</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Isaiah+6:1-5">Isaiah 6:1-5</a> ;  <a href="/1-kings/22-19.html">1&nbsp;Kings 22:19</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Luke+2:13-15">Luke 2:13-15</a> . <P>(2) In use this is the distinctive name of Deity for Israel's help and comfort in the time of her division and failure  <a href="/1-kings/18-15.html">1&nbsp;Kings 18:15</a> ;  <a href="/1-kings/19-14.html"> 19:14</a> ;  <a href="/isaiah/1-9.html">Isaiah 1:9</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Isaiah+8:11-14"> 8:11-14</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Isaiah+9:13-19"> 9:13-19</a>  ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Isaiah+10:24-27"> 10:24-27</a> ;  <a href="/isaiah/31-4.html">Isaiah 31:4</a>  <a href="/isaiah/31-5.html">Isaiah 31:5</a> ;  <a href="/haggai/2-4.html">Haggai 2:4</a> ;  <a href="/malachi/3-16.html">Malachi 3:16</a>  <a href="/malachi/3-17.html">Malachi 3:17</a> ;  <a href="/james/5-4.html">James 5:4</a> . <P>See other names of Deity, <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/genesis/genesis-1.html#Ge1_1">Genesis&nbsp;1:1</a>")</I> See Scofield " <a href="/genesis/2-4.html">Genesis 2:4</a> "  <a href="/genesis/2-7.html">Genesis 2:7</a>  See Scofield " <a href="/genesis/14-18.html">Genesis 14:18</a> " See Scofield " <a href="/genesis/15-2.html">Genesis 15:2</a> " See Scofield " <a href="/genesis/17-1.html">Genesis 17:1</a> " See Scofield " <a href="/genesis/21-33.html">Genesis 21:33</a> " <P><P><P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><!--pageCount=1-->
