		<span><B>Chapter 5</B></span><P><a href="/song-of-solomon/5-2.html"><B>5&#058;2</B></a>&nbsp; I sleep, but my heart waketh: it is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>sleep</span></B> <P>The bride is satisfied with her washed feet while the Bridegroom, His "head filled with dew," and His "locks with the drops of night," is toiling for others. See  <a href="/luke/6-12.html">Luke 6:12</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Luke+14:21-23"> 14:21-23</a> . The state of the bride is not one of sin, but of neglect of service. She is preoccupied with the graces and perfections which she has in Christ through the Spirit ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=1 Corinthians+12:4-11">1&nbsp;Corinthians 12:4-11</a> ;  <a href="/galatians/5-22.html">Galatians 5:22</a>  <a href="/galatians/5-23.html">Galatians 5:23</a> . It is mysticism, unbalanced by the activities of the Christian warfare. Her feet are washed, her hands drop with sweet smelling myrrh; but He has gone on, and now she must seek Him (cf.  <a href="/luke/2-44.html">Luke 2:44</a>  <a href="/luke/2-45.html">Luke 2:45</a> ). <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/song-of-solomon/5-6.html"><B>5&#058;6</B></a>&nbsp; I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>I sought him</span></B> <P>Observe, it is now the Bridegroom Himself who occupies her heart, not His gifts-- myrrh and washed feet  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=John+13:2-9">John 13:2-9</a> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/song-of-solomon/5-12.html"><B>5&#058;12</B></a>&nbsp; His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters, washed with milk, and fitly set. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>fitly set</span></B> Heb.
