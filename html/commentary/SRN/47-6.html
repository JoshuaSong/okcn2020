The underlying principle is that in a moral universe it is impossible for God to fully bless and use His children who are in compromise or complicity with evil. The unequal yoke is anything which unites a child of God and an unbeliever in a common purpose  <a href="/deuteronomy/22-10.html">Deuteronomy 22:10</a> . <P>(2) Separation from evil implies (a) separation in desire, motive, and act, from the world, in the ethically bad sense of this present world-system. <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/revelation/revelation-13.html#Re13_8">Revelation&nbsp;13:8</a>")</I> and (b) separation from believers, especially false teachers, who are "vessels unto dishonour"  <a href="/2-timothy/2-20.html">2 Timothy 2:20</a>  <a href="/2-timothy/2-21.html">2 Timothy 2:21</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=2 John+1:9-11">2&nbsp;John 1:9-11</a> . <P>(3) Separation is not from contact with evil in the world or the church, but from complicity with and conformity to  <a href="/john/17-15.html">John 17:15</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=2 Corinthians+6:14-18">2&nbsp;Corinthians 6:14-18</a> ;  <a href="/galatians/6-1.html">Galatians 6:1</a> . <P>(4) The reward of separation is the full manifestation of the divine fatherhood  <a href="/2-corinthians/6-17.html">2 Corinthians 6:17</a>  <a href="/2-corinthians/6-18.html">2 Corinthians 6:18</a>  unhindered communion and worship  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Hebrews+13:13-15">Hebrews 13:13-15</a>  and fruitful service  <a href="/2-timothy/2-21.html">2&nbsp;Timothy 2:21</a>  as world-conformity involves the loss of these, though not of salvation. Here, as in all else, Christ is the model. He was "holy, harmless, undefiled, and separate from sinners"  <a href="/hebrews/7-26.html">Hebrews 7:26</a>  and yet in such contact with them for their salvation that the Pharisees, who illustrate the mechanical and ascetic conception of separation <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/matthew/matthew-3.html#Mt3_7">Matthew&nbsp;3:7</a>")</I> , judged Him as having lost His Nazarite character.  <a href="/luke/7-39.html">Luke 7:39</a>  Cf ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=1 Corinthians+9:19-23">1&nbsp;Corinthians 9:19-23</a> ;  <a href="/1-corinthians/10-27.html"> 10:27</a> . <P><P><P><P><P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><!--pageCount=1-->
