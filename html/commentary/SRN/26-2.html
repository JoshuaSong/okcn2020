		<span><B>Chapter 2</B></span><P><a href="/ezekiel/2-1.html"><B>2&#058;1</B></a>&nbsp; And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak unto thee. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>Son of man</span></B> <P>"Son of man," used by our Lord of Himself seventy-nine times, is used by Jehovah ninety one times when addressing Ezekiel. <P>(1) In the case of our Lord the meaning is clear: it is His racial name as the representative Man in the sense of  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=1 Corinthians+15:45-47">1&nbsp;Corinthians 15:45-47</a> . The same thought, implying transcendence of mere Judaism, is involved in the phrase when applied to Ezekiel. Israel had forgotten her mission. <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/genesis/genesis-11.html#Ge11_10">Genesis&nbsp;11:10</a>")</I>  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Ezekiel+5:5-8">Ezekiel 5:5-8</a> . Now, in her captivity, Jehovah will not forsake His people, but He will remind them that they are but a small part of the race for whom He also cares. Hence the emphasis upon the word "man." The Cherubim "had the likeness of a man"  <a href="/ezekiel/1-5.html">Ezekiel 1:5</a>  and when the prophet beheld the throne of God, he saw "the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it"  <a href="/ezekiel/1-26.html">Ezekiel 1:26</a> . See Scofield " <a href="/matthew/8-20.html">Matthew 8:20</a> "  <a href="/revelation/1-12.html">Revelation 1:12</a>  <a href="/revelation/1-13.html">Revelation 1:13</a> . <P>(2) As used of Ezekiel, the expression indicates, not what the prophet is in himself, but what he is to God; a son of man <P>(a) chosen, <P>(b) endued with the Spirit, and <P>(c) sent of God. <P>All this is true also of Christ who was, furthermore, the representative man--the head of regenerate humanity. <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><!--pageCount=1-->
