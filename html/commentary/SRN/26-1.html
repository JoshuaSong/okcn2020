		<span><B>Chapter 1</B></span><P><a href="/ezekiel/1-5.html"><B>1&#058;5</B></a>&nbsp; Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a man. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>living creatures</span></B> <P>The "living creatures" are identical with the Cherubim. The subject is somewhat obscure, but from the position of the Cherubim at the gate of Eden, upon the cover of the ark of the covenant, and in Rev. 4., it is clearly gathered that they have to do with vindication of the holiness of God as against the presumptuous pride of sinful man who, despite his sin, would "put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life"  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Genesis+3:22-24">Genesis 3:22-24</a> . Upon the ark of the covenant, of one substance with the mercy-seat, they saw the sprinkled blood which, in type, spake of the perfect maintenance of the divine righteousness by the sacrifice of Christ  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Exodus+25:17-20">Exodus 25:17-20</a> . <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/romans/romans-3.html#Ro3_24">Romans&nbsp;3:24</a>")</I> . See Scofield " <a href="/romans/3-25.html">Romans 3:25</a> ". See Scofield " <a href="/romans/3-26.html">Romans 3:26</a> ". The living creatures (or Cherubim) appear to be actual beings of the angelic order. Cf. See Scofield " <a href="/isaiah/6-2.html">Isaiah 6:2</a> ". The Cherubim or living creatures are not identical with the Seraphim.  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Isaiah+6:2-7">Isaiah 6:2-7</a> . They appear to have to do with the holiness of God as outraged by sin; the Seraphim with uncleanness in the people of God. The passage in Ezekiel is highly figurative, but the effect was the revelation to the prophet of the Shekinah glory of the Lord. Such revelations are connected invariably with new blessing and service. Cf. ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Exodus+3:2-10">Exodus 3:2-10</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Isaiah+6:1-10">Isaiah 6:1-10</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Daniel+10:5-14">Daniel 10:5-14</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Revelation+1:12-19">Revelation 1:12-19</a> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><!--pageCount=1-->
