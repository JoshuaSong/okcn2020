Having the assurance that in the tabernacle everything is typical, the details must of necessity be received as such. Two warnings are necessary: <P>(1) Nothing may be dogmatically asserted to be a type without explicit New Testament authority; and <P>(2) all types not so authenticated must be recognized as having the authority of analogy, or spiritual congruity, merely. The typical meanings of the materials and colours of the tabernacle are believed to be as follows: Gold, Deity in manifestation--divine glory; silver, redemption  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Exodus+30:12-16">Exodus 30:12-16</a> . <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/exodus/exodus-38.html#Ex38_27">Exodus&nbsp;38:27</a>")</I> , brass, symbol of judgment, as in the brazen altar and in the serpent of brass  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Numbers+21:6-9">Numbers 21:6-9</a>  blue, heavenly in nature or origin; purple, royalty; scarlet, sacrifice. <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/exodus/25-2.html"><B>25&#058;2</B></a>&nbsp; Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring me an offering: of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take my offering.  <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>willingly</span></B> <P><I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/2-corinthians/2-corinthians-8.html#2Co8_1">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;8:1</a>")</I> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/exodus/25-5.html"><B>25&#058;5</B></a>&nbsp; And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim wood, <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>shittim wood</span></B> <P>i.e. acacia. <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/exodus/25-9.html"><B>25&#058;9</B></a>&nbsp; According to all that I shew thee, after the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments thereof, even so shall ye make it. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>tabernacle pattern</span></B> <P>The tabernacle, speaking comprehensively, is explained in the N.T. as typical in three ways: <P>(1) of the Church as a habitation of God through the Spirit  <a href="/exodus/25-8.html">Exodus 25:8</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Ephesians+2:19-22">Ephesians 2:19-22</a>  <P>(2) of the believer  <a href="/2-corinthians/6-16.html">2&nbsp;Corinthians 6:16</a>  <P>(3) as a figure of things in the heavens  <a href="/hebrews/9-23.html">Hebrews 9:23</a>  <a href="/hebrews/9-24.html">Hebrews 9:24</a> .

(b) the wilderness food (or portion) of His people  <a href="/exodus/16-33.html">Exodus 16:33</a>  (c) Himself the resurrection, of which Aaron;s rod is the symbol  <a href="/numbers/17-10.html">Numbers 17:10</a> . <P><P><P>(3) In its use the ark, especially the mercy-seat, was a type of God's throne. That it was, to the sinning Israelite, a throne of grace and not of judgment was due to the mercy-seat formed of gold and sprinkled with the blood of atonement, which vindicated the law, and divine holiness guarded by the cherubim  <a href="/genesis/3-24.html">Genesis 3:24</a>  <P><I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/ezekiel/ezekiel-1.html#Eze1_5">Ezekiel&nbsp;1:5</a>")</I> See PROPITIATION, See Scofield " <a href="/romans/3-25.html">Romans 3:25</a> " <P><P><P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/exodus/25-10.html"><B>25&#058;10</B></a>&nbsp; And they shall make an ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><P><B><span>make an ark</span></B> <P>All begins with the ark, which, in the completed tabernacle, was placed in the holy of holies, because, in revelation, God begins from Himself, working outward toward man; as, in approach, the worshipper begins from himself, moving toward God in the holy of holies. The same order is followed in the Levitical offerings (Le 1.-5.). In approach man begins at the brazen altar, type of the Cross, where, in the fire of judgment, atonement is made. <P><B><span>make an ark</span></B> The most inclusive type of Christ, Gold = Deity; wood = humanity.
