Antipater was appointed procurator of Judea by Julius Caesar, B.C. 47. At the age of fifteen Herod was appointed to the government of Galilee. B.C. 40 the Roman senate made him king of Judea. An able, strong, and cruel man, he increased greatly the splendour of Jerusalem, erecting the temple which was the centre of Jewish worship in the time of our Lord. <P><P><P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/matthew/2-2.html"><B>2&#058;2</B></a>&nbsp; Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>King</span></B> <P>"The King" is one of the divine titles  <a href="/psalms/10-16.html">Psalms 10:16</a>  and so used in the worship of the Church  <a href="/1-timothy/1-17.html">1&nbsp;Timothy 1:17</a>  but Christ is never called "King of the Church."

Heb. "spherim," "to write," "set in order," "count." The scribes were so called because it was their office to make copies of the Scriptures; to classify and teach the precepts of oral law <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/matthew/matthew-3.html#Mt3_7">Matthew&nbsp;3:7</a>")</I> and to keep careful count of every letter in the O.T. writings. Such an office was necessary in a religion of law and precept, and was an O.T. function  <a href="/2-samuel/8-17.html">2&nbsp;Samuel 8:17</a> ;  <a href="/2-samuel/20-25.html"> 20:25</a> ;  <a href="/1-kings/4-3.html">1&nbsp;Kings 4:3</a> ;  <a href="/jeremiah/8-8.html">Jeremiah 8:8</a> ;  <a href="/jeremiah/36-10.html">Jeremiah 36:10</a>  <a href="/jeremiah/36-12.html">Jeremiah 36:12</a>  <a href="/jeremiah/36-26.html">Jeremiah 36:26</a> . To this legitimate work the scribes added a record of rabbinical decisions on questions of ritual (Halachoth); the new code resulting from those decisions (Mishna); the Hebrew sacred legends (Gemara, forming with the Mishna the Talmud); commentaries on the O.T. (Midrashim); reasonings upon these (Hagada); and finally, mystical interpretations which found in Scripture meanings other than the grammatical, lexical, and obvious ones (the Kabbala); not unlike the allegorical method of Origen, or the modern Protestant "spiritualizing" interpretation. In our Lord's time, to receive this mass of writing superposed upon the Scriptures was to be orthodox; to return to the Scriptures themselves was heterodoxy--our Lord's most serious offence. <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/matthew/2-15.html"><B>2&#058;15</B></a>&nbsp; And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>Out of Egypt</span></B> <P>The words quoted are in  <a href="/hosea/11-1.html">Hosea 11:1</a>  and the passage illustrates the truth that prophetic utterances often have a latent and deeper meaning than at first appears.
