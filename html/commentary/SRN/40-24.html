The order is as follows: "when shall these things be?"--i.e. destruction of the temple and city. Answer:  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Luke+21:20-24">Luke 21:20-24</a> . <P>Second and third questions: "And what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the age?" Answer:  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Matthew+24:4-33">Matthew 24:4-33</a> . <P>Verses 4 to 14 have a double interpretation: They give <P>(1) the character of the age--wars, international conflicts, famines, pestilences, persecutions, and false Christs (cf)  <a href="/daniel/9-26.html">Daniel 9:26</a> . <P>This is not the description of a converted world. <P>(2) But the same answer ( <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Matthew+24:4-14">Matthew 24:4-14</a> ) applies in a specific way to the end of the age, viz.

The passage in Luke refers in express terms to a destruction of Jerusalem which was fulfilled by Titus, A.D. 70; the passage in Matthew to a future crisis in Jerusalem after the manifestation of the abomination. See "Beast" ;  <a href="/daniel/7-8.html">Daniel 7:8</a> ;  <a href="/revelation/19-20.html">Revelation 19:20</a>  and "Armageddon" ;  <a href="/revelation/16-14.html">Revelation 16:14</a> ;  <a href="/revelation/19-17.html"> 19:17</a> . <P>As the circumstances in both cases will be similar, so are the warnings.
