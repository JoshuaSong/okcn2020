The near view is of Sennacherib's invasion and the destruction of the Assyrian host by the angel of the Lord (Isa. 36., 37.); the far view is that of the final gathering of the Gentile hosts against Jerusalem at the end of the great tribulation  <a href="/psalms/2-5.html">Psalms 2:5</a> ;  <a href="/revelation/7-14.html">Revelation 7:14</a>  when a still greater deliverance will be wrought. (See "Times of the Gentiles," ;  <a href="/luke/21-24.html">Luke 21:24</a> ;  <a href="/revelation/16-14.html">Revelation 16:14</a> . The same remark applies also to  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Isaiah+28:14-18">Isaiah 28:14-18</a>  where there is a near reference to the Egyptian alliance ("we have made a covenant," etc.), while the reference to the stone  <a href="/isaiah/29-16.html">Isaiah 29:16</a>  carries the meaning forward to the end-time, and the covenant of unbelieving Israel with the Beast.  <a href="/daniel/9-27.html">Daniel 9:27</a> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/isaiah/29-22.html"><B>29&#058;22</B></a>&nbsp; Therefore thus saith the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob, Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now wax pale. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>redeemed</span></B> <P><I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/isaiah/isaiah-59.html#Isa59_20">Isaiah&nbsp;59:20</a>")</I> See Scofield " <a href="/exodus/14-30.html">Exodus 14:30</a> ". <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><!--pageCount=1-->
