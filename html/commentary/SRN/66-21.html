		<span><B>Chapter 21</B></span><P><a href="/revelation/21-8.html"><B>21&#058;8</B></a>&nbsp; But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>second death</span></B> <P>Second death, Summary: "The second death" and the "lake of fire" are identical terms  <a href="/revelation/20-14.html">Revelation 20:14</a>  and are used of the eternal state of the wicked. It is "second" relative to the preceding physical death of the wicked in unbelief and rejection of God; their eternal state is one of eternal "death" (i.e. separation from God) in sins  <a href="/john/8-21.html">John 8:21</a>  <a href="/john/8-24.html">John 8:24</a> . That the second death is not annihilation is shown by a comparison of ;  <a href="/revelation/19-20.html">Revelation 19:20</a> ;  <a href="/revelation/20-10.html"> 20:10</a> . After one thousand years in the lake of fire the Beast and False Prophet are still there, undestroyed. The words "forever and forever" ("to the ages of the ages") are used in  <a href="/hebrews/1-8.html">Hebrews 1:8</a>  for the duration of the throne of God, eternal in the sense of unending. <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/revelation/21-12.html"><B>21&#058;12</B></a>&nbsp; And had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel: <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>angels</span></B> <P><I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/hebrews/hebrews-1.html#Heb1_4">Hebrews&nbsp;1:4</a>")</I> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/revelation/21-17.html"><B>21&#058;17</B></a>&nbsp; And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>angel</span></B> <P><I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/hebrews/hebrews-1.html#Heb1_4">Hebrews&nbsp;1:4</a>")</I>  <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/revelation/21-21.html"><B>21&#058;21</B></a>&nbsp; And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; every several gate was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>street</span></B> <P> <a href="/revelation/22-2.html">Revelation 22:2,</a>  cf:  <a href="/revelation/3-4.html">Revelation 3:4</a> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/revelation/21-24.html"><B>21&#058;24</B></a>&nbsp; And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>saved</span></B> <P>Scofield " <a href="/romans/1-16.html">Romans 1:16</a> ". <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><!--pageCount=1-->
