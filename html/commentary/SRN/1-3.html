And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>The serpent</span></B> <P>The serpent, in his Edenic form, is not to be thought of as a writhing reptile. That is the effect of the curse  <a href="/genesis/3-14.html">Genesis 3:14</a> . The creature which lent itself to Satan may well have been the most beautiful as was the most "subtle" of creatures less than man. Traces of that beauty remain despite the curse. Every movement of a serpent is graceful, and many species are beautifully coloured. In the serpent, Satan first appeared as "an angel of light"  <a href="/2-corinthians/11-14.html">2&nbsp;Corinthians 11:14</a> . <P><P><P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/genesis/3-14.html"><B>3&#058;14</B></a>&nbsp; And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life: <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>And the Lord God said</span></B> <P>The Adamic Covenant conditions the life of fallen man--conditions which must remain till, in the kingdom age, "the creation also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the sons of God"  <a href="/romans/8-21.html">Romans 8:21</a> . The elements of the Adamic Covenant are: <P>(1) The serpent, Satan's tool, is cursed ( <a href="/genesis/3-14.html">Genesis 3:14</a> ), and becomes God's illustration in nature of the effects of sin--from the most beautiful and subtle of creatures to a loathsome reptile! The deepest mystery of the atonement is intimated here. Christ, "made sin for us," in bearing our judgment, is typified by the brazen serpent ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Numbers+21:5-9">Numbers 21:5-9</a> ;  <a href="/john/3-14.html">John 3:14</a> ;  <a href="/2-corinthians/5-21.html">2&nbsp;Corinthians 5:21</a> . Brass speaks of judgment--in the brazen altar, of God's judgment, and in the laver, of self-judgment. <P>(2) The first promise of a Redeemer ( <a href="/genesis/3-15.html">Genesis 3:15</a> ). Here begins the "Highway of the Seed," Abel, Seth, Noah  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Genesis+6:8-10">Genesis 6:8-10,</a>  Shem  <a href="/genesis/9-26.html">Genesis 9:26</a>  <a href="/genesis/9-27.html">Genesis 9:27</a>  Abraham  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Genesis+12:1-4">Genesis 12:1-4,</a>  Isaac  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Genesis+17:19-21">Genesis 17:19-21</a>  Jacob  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Genesis+28:10-14">Genesis 28:10-14,</a>  Judah  <a href="/genesis/49-10.html">Genesis 49:10,</a>  David  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=2 Samuel+7:5-17">2&nbsp;Samuel 7:5-17</a>  Immanuel-Christ ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Isaiah+7:9-14">Isaiah 7:9-14</a> ;  <a href="/matthew/1-1.html">Matthew 1:1</a>  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Matthew+1:20-23">Matthew 1:20-23</a> ;  <a href="/1-john/3-8.html">1&nbsp;John 3:8</a> ;  <a href="/john/12-31.html">John 12:31</a> . <P>(3) The changed state of the woman ( <a href="/genesis/3-16.html">Genesis 3:16</a> ). In three particulars: <P>(a) Multiplied conception; (b) motherhood linked with sorrow; (c) the headship of the man (cf)  <a href="/genesis/1-26.html">Genesis 1:26</a>  <a href="/genesis/1-27.html">Genesis 1:27</a>  The entrance of sin, which is disorder, makes necessary a headship, and it is vested in man ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=1 Timothy+2:11-14">1&nbsp;Timothy 2:11-14</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Ephesians+5:22-25">Ephesians 5:22-25</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=1 Corinthians+11:7-9">1&nbsp;Corinthians 11:7-9</a> . <P>(4) The earth cursed ( <a href="/genesis/3-17.html">Genesis 3:17</a> ) for man's sake. It is better for fallen man to battle with a reluctant earth than to live without toil. <P>(5) The inevitable sorrow of life ( <a href="/genesis/3-17.html">Genesis 3:17</a> ). <P>(6) The light occupation of Eden  <a href="/genesis/2-15.html">Genesis 2:15</a>  changed to burdensome labour  <a href="/genesis/3-18.html">Genesis 3:18</a>  <a href="/genesis/3-19.html">Genesis 3:19</a> . <P>(7) Physical death  <a href="/genesis/3-19.html">Genesis 3:19</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Romans+5:12-21">Romans 5:12-21,</a>  See "Death (spiritual)"  <a href="/genesis/2-17.html">Genesis 2:17</a> . <I>(See Scofield "<span class="badLink">Ephesians&nbsp;2:5</span>")</I> . <P>See for the other covenants: <P>EDENIC <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/genesis/genesis-1.html#Ge1_28">Genesis&nbsp;1:28</a>")</I>  <P>NOAHIC <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/genesis/genesis-9.html#Ge9_1">Genesis&nbsp;9:1</a>")</I>  <P>ABRAHAMIC <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/genesis/genesis-15.html#Ge15_18">Genesis&nbsp;15:18</a>")</I>  <P>MOSAIC <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/exodus/exodus-19.html#Ex19_25">Exodus&nbsp;19:25</a>")</I>  <P>PALESTINIAN <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/deuteronomy/deuteronomy-30.html#De30_3">Deuteronomy&nbsp;30:3</a>")</I>  <P>DAVIDIC <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/2-samuel/2-samuel-7.html#2Sa7_16">2&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;7:16</a>")</I>  <P>NEW <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/hebrews/hebrews-8.html#Heb8_8">Hebrews&nbsp;8:8</a>")</I>  <P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/genesis/3-15.html"><B>3&#058;15</B></a>&nbsp; And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>thou shalt bruise his heel</span></B> <P>The chain of references which begins here includes the promises and prophecies concerning Christ which were fulfilled in His birth and works at His first advent.

By disobedience man came to a personal and experimental knowledge of good and evil--of good as obedience, of evil as disobedience to the known will of God. Through that knowledge conscience awoke. Expelled from Eden and placed under the second, or ADAMIC COVENANT, man was responsible to do all known good, to abstain from all known evil, and to approach God through sacrifice. The result of this second testing of man is stated in  <a href="/genesis/6-5.html">Genesis 6:5</a>  and the dispensation ended in the judgment of the Flood. Apparently "the east of the garden"  <a href="/genesis/3-24.html">Genesis 3:24</a>  where were the cherubims and the flame, remained the place of worship through this second dispensation.
