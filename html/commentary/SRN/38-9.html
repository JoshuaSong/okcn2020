But the greater meaning converges on the yet future last days <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/acts/acts-2.html#Ac2_17">Acts&nbsp;2:17</a>")</I> as the last clause of verse  <a href="/zechariah/9-8.html">Zechariah 9:8</a>  shows, for many oppressors have passed through Jerusalem since the days of Alexander. <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/zechariah/9-9.html"><B>9&#058;9</B></a>&nbsp; Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>behold, thy King</span></B> <P>The events following this manifestation of Christ as King are recorded in the Gospels. The real faith of the multitude who cried, "Hosanna" is given in  <a href="/matthew/21-11.html">Matthew 21:11</a>  and so little was Jesus deceived by His apparent reception as King, that He wept over Jerusalem and announced its impending destruction (fulfilled A.D. 70;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Luke+19:38-44">Luke 19:38-44</a> . The same multitude soon cried, "Crucify Him." <P><P><P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/zechariah/9-10.html"><B>9&#058;10</B></a>&nbsp; And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be cut off: and he shall speak peace unto the heathen: and his dominion shall be from sea even to sea, and from the river even to the ends of the earth. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>And I will cut off</span></B> <P>Having introduced the King in  <a href="/zechariah/9-9.html">Zechariah 9:9,</a> ;  <a href="/zechariah/9-10.html">Zechariah 9:10</a>  and the verses which follow look forward to the end-time and kingdom.
