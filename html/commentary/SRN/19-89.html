That the covenant itself looks far beyond David and Solomon is sure from  <a href="/psalms/89-27.html">Psalms 89:27</a> . "Higher than the kings of the earth" can only refer to Immanuel. ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Isaiah+7:13-15">Isaiah 7:13-15</a> ;  <a href="/isaiah/9-6.html">Isaiah 9:6</a>  <a href="/isaiah/9-7.html">Isaiah 9:7</a> ;  <a href="/micah/5-2.html">Micah 5:2</a> . <P>The Psalm is in four parts: <P>(1) The covenant, though springing from the lovingkindness of Jehovah, yet rests upon His oath (vs. 1-4). <P>(2) Jehovah is glorified for His power and goodness in connection with the covenant (vs 5-18). <P>(3) The response of Jehovah (vs. 19-37). This is in two parts: <P>(a), it confirms the covenant ( <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Psalms+89:19-29">Psalms 89:19-29</a> ), but (b), warns that disobedience in the royal posterity of David will be punished with chastening ( <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Psalms+89:30-32">Psalms 89:30-32</a> ). Historically this chastening began in the division of the Davidic kingdom ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=1 Kings+11:26-36">1&nbsp;Kings 11:26-36</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=1 Kings+12:16-20"> 12:16-20</a>  and culminated in the captivities and that subordination of Israel to the Gentiles which still continues. See "Gentiles, times of" ;  <a href="/luke/21-24.html">Luke 21:24</a> ;  <a href="/revelation/16-14.html">Revelation 16:14</a> . <P>(4) The plea of the Remnant  <a href="/isaiah/1-9.html">Isaiah 1:9</a> ;  <a href="/romans/11-5.html">Romans 11:5</a>  who urge the severity and long continuance of the chastening ( <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Psalms+89:38-52">Psalms 89:38-52</a> ). <P>See Psalm 102., next in order of the Messianic Psalms. <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/psalms/89-48.html"><B>89&#058;48</B></a>&nbsp; What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave?
