Only when used of God himself (e.g.  <a href="/leviticus/11-45.html">Leviticus 11:45</a> ), or of the holy angels (e.g.  <a href="/daniel/4-13.html">Daniel 4:13</a> ) is any inward ;  <a href="/leviticus/11-45.html">Leviticus 11:45</a> ;  <a href="/daniel/4-13.html">Daniel 4:13</a>  moral quality necessarily implied. Doubtless a priest or other person set apart to the service of God, whose whole will and desire went with his setting apart, experienced progressively an inner detachment from evil; but that aspect is distinctively of the N.T., not of the O.T.  <a href="/matthew/4-5.html">Matthew 4:5</a> . <P><P><P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/zechariah/8-6.html"><B>8&#058;6</B></a>&nbsp; Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If it be marvellous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in these days, should it also be marvellous in mine eyes? saith the LORD of hosts. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><P><B><span>these days</span></B> <P>The "remnant" in  <a href="/zechariah/8-6.html">Zechariah 8:6</a>  <a href="/zechariah/8-11.html">Zechariah 8:11</a>  <a href="/zechariah/8-12.html">Zechariah 8:12</a>  refers to the remnant of Judah which returned from Babylon, and among whom Zechariah was prophesying. <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/romans/romans-11.html#Ro11_5">Romans&nbsp;11:5</a>")</I> . <P><B><span>remnant</span></B> <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/jeremiah/jeremiah-15.html#Jer15_21">Jeremiah&nbsp;15:21</a>")</I>  <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/zechariah/8-11.html"><B>8&#058;11</B></a>&nbsp; But now I will not be unto the residue of this people as in the former days, saith the LORD of hosts. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>residue</span></B> <P>Or, remnant. <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/zechariah/8-14.html"><B>8&#058;14</B></a>&nbsp; For thus saith the LORD of hosts; As I thought to punish you, when your fathers provoked me to wrath, saith the LORD of hosts, and I repented not: <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>repented</span></B> <P>Repentance (O.T.), Summary: In the O.T., repentance is the English word used to translate the Heb. nacham, to be "eased" or "comforted." It is used of both God and man. Notwithstanding the literal meaning of nacham, it is evident, from a study of all the passages, that the sacred writers use it in the sense of metanoia in the N.T.--a change of mind.  <a href="/matthew/3-2.html">Matthew 3:2</a>  <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/acts/acts-17.html#Ac17_30">Acts&nbsp;17:30</a>")</I> . As in the N.T., such change of mind is often accompanied by contrition and self-judgment. When applied to God the word is used phenomenally according to O.T. custom. God seems to change His mind. The phenomena are such as, in the case of man, would indicate a change of mind. <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/zechariah/8-19.html"><B>8&#058;19</B></a>&nbsp; Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The fast of the fourth month, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of Judah joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts; therefore love the truth and peace. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><P><P><B><span>fourth month</span></B> i.e. July. <P><B><span>fifth month</span></B> i.e. August. <P><B><span>seventh month</span></B> i.e. October. <P><B><span>tenth month</span></B> i.e. January. <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/zechariah/8-23.html"><B>8&#058;23</B></a>&nbsp; Thus saith the LORD of hosts; In those days it shall come to pass, that ten men shall take hold out of all languages of the nations, even shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew, saying, We will go with you: for we have heard that God is with you. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>those days</span></B> <P>i.e. in the days when Jerusalem has been made the centre of the earth's worship.  <a href="/zechariah/8-23.html">Zechariah 8:23</a>  explains: the Jew (see "Remnant," ;  <a href="/isaiah/1-9.html">Isaiah 1:9</a> ;  <a href="/romans/11-5.html">Romans 11:5</a>  will then be the missionary, and to the very "nations" now called "Christian"! <P>For Another Point of View: See Topic 301242 <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><!--pageCount=1-->
