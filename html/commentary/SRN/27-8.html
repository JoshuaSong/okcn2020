		<span><B>Chapter 8</B></span><P><a href="/daniel/8-1.html"><B>8&#058;1</B></a>&nbsp; In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><P><B><span>vision</span></B> <P>The eighth chapter gives details concerning the second and third world-kingdoms: the silver and brass kingdoms of Dan. 2.; the bear and leopard kingdoms of Dan. 7., viz., the Medo-Persian and Macedonian kingdoms of history. At the time of this vision ( <a href="/daniel/8-1.html">Daniel 8:1</a> ) the first monarchy was nearing its end. Belshazzar was the last king of that monarchy. <P><B><span>third year</span></B> About B.C. 530. <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/daniel/8-3.html"><B>8&#058;3</B></a>&nbsp; Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>ram</span></B> <P><I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/daniel/daniel-8.html#Da8_20">Daniel&nbsp;8:20</a>")</I> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/daniel/8-9.html"><B>8&#058;9</B></a>&nbsp; And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant land. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><P><B><span>little horn</span></B> <P>The "little horn" here is a prophecy fulfilled in Antiochus Epiphanes, B.C. 175, who profaned the temple and terribly persecuted the Jews. He is not to be confounded with the "little horn" of Dan. 7. who is yet to come, and who will dominate the earth during the great tribulation. <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/daniel/daniel-7.html#Da7_8">Daniel&nbsp;7:8</a>")</I> concerning "The Beast". See Scofield " <a href="/revelation/19-20.html">Revelation 19:20</a> " and "The great tribulation,"  <a href="/psalms/2-5.html">Psalms 2:5</a> . See Scofield " <a href="/revelation/7-14.html">Revelation 7:14</a> ". But Antiochus is a remarkable type of the Beast, the terrible "little horn" of the last days. Verses 24,25 go beyond Antiochus and evidently refer to the "little horn" of Dan. 7. Both Antiochus and the Beast, but the Beast pre-eminently, are in view in verses 24,25. That the "little horn" of Dan. 7. cannot be the little horn of  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Daniel+8:9-13">Daniel 8:9-13</a>  <a href="/daniel/8-23.html">Daniel 8:23</a>  is evident. The former comes up among the ten horns into which the fourth empire (Roman) is to be divided; the little horn of Dan. 8. comes out of one of the four kingdoms into which the third (Grecian) empire was divided ( <a href="/daniel/8-23.html">Daniel 8:23</a> ), and in "the latter time" of the four kingdoms  <a href="/daniel/8-22.html">Daniel 8:22</a>  <a href="/daniel/8-23.html">Daniel 8:23</a> ). This was historically true of Antiochus Epiphanes. They are alike in hatred of the Jews and of God, and in profaning the temple. Cf.  <a href="/daniel/7-25.html">Daniel 7:25</a>  (the Beast) with  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Daniel+8:10-12">Daniel 8:10-12</a>  (Antiochus): <P><B><span>one of them</span></B> Anticohus Epiphanes came out of Syria, one of the "four notable" kingdoms into which Alexander's empire was divided. <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/daniel/8-10.html"><B>8&#058;10</B></a>&nbsp; And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>And it waxed great</span></B> <P>This passage ( <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Daniel+8:10-14">Daniel 8:10-14</a> ) is confessedly the most difficult in prophecy, a difficulty increased by the present state of the text. Historically this was fulfilled in and by Antiochus Epiphanes, but in a more intense and final sense Antiochus but adumbrates the awful blasphemy of the "little horn" of ;  <a href="/daniel/7-8.html">Daniel 7:8</a>  <a href="/daniel/7-24.html">Daniel 7:24</a>  <a href="/daniel/7-25.html">Daniel 7:25</a> ;  <a href="/daniel/9-27.html"> 9:27</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Daniel+11:36-45"> 11:36-45</a> ;  <a href="/daniel/12-11.html"> 12:11</a> .
