		<span><B>Chapter 6</B></span><P><a href="/genesis/6-4.html"><B>6&#058;4</B></a>&nbsp; There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>sons of God</span></B> <P>Some hold that these "sons of God" were the "angels which kept not their first estate"  <a href="/jude/1-6.html">Jude 1:6</a> . It is asserted that the title is in the O.T. exclusively used of angels. But this is an error  <a href="/isaiah/43-6.html">Isaiah 43:6</a> . Angels are spoken of in a sexless way. No female angels are mentioned in Scripture, and we are expressly told that marriage is unknown among angels.  <a href="/matthew/22-30.html">Matthew 22:30</a> . <P>The uniform Hebrew and Christian interpretation has been that verse  <a href="/genesis/6-2.html">Genesis 6:2</a>  marks the breaking down of the separation between the godly line of Seth and the godless line of Cain, and so the failure of the testimony to Jehovah committed to the line of Seth  <a href="/genesis/4-26.html">Genesis 4:26</a> . For apostasy there is no remedy but judgment ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Isaiah+1:2-7">Isaiah 1:2-7</a>  <a href="/isaiah/1-24.html">Isaiah 1:24</a>  <a href="/isaiah/1-25.html">Isaiah 1:25</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Hebrews+6:4-8">Hebrews 6:4-8</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Hebrews+10:26-31"> 10:26-31</a> . Noah, "a preacher of righteousness," is given 120 years, but he won no convert, and the judgment predicted by his great- grandfather fell ;  <a href="/jude/1-14.html">Jude 1:14</a>  <a href="/jude/1-15.html">Jude 1:15</a> ;  <a href="/genesis/7-11.html">Genesis 7:11</a> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/genesis/6-5.html"><B>6&#058;5</B></a>&nbsp; And GOD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.  <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>imagination</span></B> <P>Or, the whole imagination. The Hebrew word signifies not only the imagination but also the purposes and desires. <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/genesis/6-6.html"><B>6&#058;6</B></a>&nbsp; And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>repented the LORD</span></B> <P><I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/zechariah/zechariah-8.html#Zec8_14">Zechariah&nbsp;8:14</a>")</I> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/genesis/6-9.html"><B>6&#058;9</B></a>&nbsp; These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>walked</span></B> <P>Noah and Enoch are the two antediluvians of whom it is said that they "walked with God"  <a href="/genesis/5-24.html">Genesis 5:24</a> ;  <a href="/genesis/6-9.html"> 6:9</a> . Enoch, "translated that he should not see death"  <a href="/hebrews/11-5.html">Hebrews 11:5</a>  becomes a type of the saints who will be "caught up" before the great tribulation ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=1 Thessalonians+4:14-17">1&nbsp;Thessalonians 4:14-17</a> ;  <a href="/revelation/3-10.html">Revelation 3:10</a> ;  <a href="/daniel/12-1.html">Daniel 12:1</a> ;  <a href="/matthew/24-21.html">Matthew 24:21</a> . Noah, preserved through the Flood, is a type of the Israelitish people who will be preserved through the tribulation  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Jeremiah+30:5-9">Jeremiah 30:5-9</a> . See "Tribulation" ;  <a href="/psalms/2-5.html">Psalms 2:5</a> ;  <a href="/revelation/7-14.html">Revelation 7:14</a> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/genesis/6-14.html"><B>6&#058;14</B></a>&nbsp; Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>ark</span></B> <P>"Ark": type of Christ as the refuge of His people from judgment  <a href="/hebrews/11-7.html">Hebrews 11:7</a> . In strictness of application this speaks of the preservation through the "great tribulation"  <a href="/matthew/24-21.html">Matthew 24:21</a>  <a href="/matthew/24-22.html">Matthew 24:22</a>  of the remnant of Israel who will turn to the Lord after the Church (typified by Enoch, who was translated to heaven before the judgment of the Flood) has been caught up to meet the Lord ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Genesis+5:22-24">Genesis 5:22-24</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=1 Thessalonians+4:15-17">1&nbsp;Thessalonians 4:15-17</a>  ;  <a href="/hebrews/11-5.html">Hebrews 11:5</a> ;  <a href="/isaiah/2-10.html">Isaiah 2:10</a>  <a href="/isaiah/2-11.html">Isaiah 2:11</a> ;  <a href="/isaiah/26-20.html">Isaiah 26:20</a>  <a href="/isaiah/26-21.html">Isaiah 26:21</a> . But the type also has a present reference to the position of the believer "in Christ" (Ep 1.), etc. It should be noted that the word translated "pitch" in  <a href="/genesis/6-14.html">Genesis 6:14</a>  is the same word translated "atonement" in  <a href="/leviticus/17-11.html">Leviticus 17:11</a>  etc. It is atonement that keeps out the waters of judgment and makes the believer's position "in Christ" safe and blessed. <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/genesis/6-19.html"><B>6&#058;19</B></a>&nbsp; And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>two of every sort</span></B> <P>Cf  <a href="/genesis/7-2.html">Genesis 7:2</a> . <P>In addition to two animals, etc., commanded ( <a href="/genesis/6-19.html">Genesis 6:19</a> ) to be preserved for future increase ("they shall be male and female"), the further command was given more than 100 years later to take of clean beasts, i.e, acceptable for sacrifice, seven each. Exodus gives ten such beasts, or but seventy in all. Modern ships carry hundreds of live beasts, with their food, besides scores of human beings. <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><!--pageCount=1-->
