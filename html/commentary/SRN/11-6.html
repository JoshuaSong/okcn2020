The N.T. invariably expounds the typology of the tabernacle, not of the temple. The symbolism of the latter may be revealed in the kingdom-age (see "Kingdom" O.T., <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/genesis/genesis-1.html#Ge1_26">Genesis&nbsp;1:26</a>")</I> See Scofield " <a href="/zechariah/12-8.html">Zechariah 12:8</a> " N.T., ;  <a href="/luke/1-32.html">Luke 1:32</a> ;  <a href="/1-corinthians/15-28.html">1&nbsp;Corinthians 15:28</a> .

In the holy of holies in the tabernacle no light but the shekinah glory was provided.
