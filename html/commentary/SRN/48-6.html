Ordinarily, therefore, he dictated his letters. But now, having no amanuensis at hand, but urged by the spiritual danger of his dear Galatians, he writes, we cannot know with what pain and difficulty, with his own hand, in the "large letters" his darkened vision compelled him to use. <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/galatians/6-12.html"><B>6&#058;12</B></a>&nbsp; As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>constrain you to be circumcised</span></B> <P>"Circumcision" stands here for externality in religion -- form rather than spirit.  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Colossians+2:16-23">Colossians 2:16-23</a> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/galatians/6-14.html"><B>6&#058;14</B></a>&nbsp; But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>world</span></B> <P>kosmos = world-system.  <a href="/ephesians/2-2.html">Ephesians 2:2</a> ;  <a href="/john/7-7.html">John 7:7</a> . <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/revelation/revelation-13.html#Re13_8">Revelation&nbsp;13:8</a>")</I> . <!--pageCount=1-->
