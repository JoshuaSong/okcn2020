The tradition from Clement to Eusebius favours two imprisonments with a year of liberty between. Erdman (W.J.) has pointed out the leaving of Trophimus sick at Miletus, mentioned in  <a href="/2-timothy/4-20.html">2&nbsp;Timothy 4:20</a>  could not have been an occurrence of Paul's last journey to Jerusalem, for then Trophimus was not left ;  <a href="/acts/20-4.html">Acts 20:4</a> ;  <a href="/acts/21-29.html"> 21:29</a>  nor of the journey to Rome to appear before Caesar, for then he did not touch at Miletus. To make this incident possible there must have been a release from the first imprisonment, and an interval of ministry and travel. <!--pageCount=1-->
