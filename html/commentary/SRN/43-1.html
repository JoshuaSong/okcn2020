"Logos" (arm. "Memra," used in the Targums, or Heb. paraphrases, for God). The Greek term means, <P>(1) a thought or concept; <P>(2) the expression or utterance of that thought. As a designation of Christ, therefore, Logos is peculiarly felicitous because, <P>(1) in Him are embodied all the treasures of the divine wisdom, the collective "thought" of God  <a href="/1-corinthians/1-24.html">1&nbsp;Corinthians 1:24</a> ;  <a href="/ephesians/3-11.html">Ephesians 3:11</a> ;  <a href="/colossians/2-2.html">Colossians 2:2</a>  <a href="/colossians/2-3.html">Colossians 2:3</a>  and, <P>(2) He is from eternity, but especially in His incarnation, the utterance or expression of the Person, and "thought" of Deity  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=John+1:3-5">John 1:3-5</a>  <a href="/john/1-9.html">John 1:9</a>  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=John+1:14-18">John 1:14-18</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=John+14:9-11"> 14:9-11</a> ;  <a href="/colossians/2-9.html">Colossians 2:9</a> . <P>In the Being, Person, and work of Christ, Deity is told out. <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/john/1-5.html"><B>1&#058;5</B></a>&nbsp; And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>comprehended</span></B> <P>Or, apprehended; lit.
