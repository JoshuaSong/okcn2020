Both are miraculous and both are equally credible.  <a href="/2-kings/14-25.html">2&nbsp;Kings 14:25</a>  records the fulfilment of a prophecy by Jonah. The man himself was a bigoted Jew, unwilling to testify to a Gentile city, and angry that God had spared it. Typically he foreshadows the nation of Israel out of its own land; a trouble to the Gentiles, yet witnessing to them; cast out by them, but miraculously preserved; in their future deepest distress calling upon Jehovah-Saviour, and finding deliverance, and then becoming missionaries to the Gentiles.  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Zechariah+8:7-23">Zechariah 8:7-23</a> . <P>He typifies Christ as the Sent One, raised from the dead, and carrying salvation to the Gentiles.
