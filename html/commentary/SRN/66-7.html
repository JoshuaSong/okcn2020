Involving in a measure the whole earth  <a href="/revelation/3-10.html">Revelation 3:10</a>  it is yet distinctly "the time of Jacob's trouble"  <a href="/jeremiah/30-7.html">Jeremiah 30:7</a>  and its vortex Jerusalem and the Holy Land. It involves the people of God who will have returned to Palestine in unbelief. Its duration is three and a half years, or the last half of the seventieth week of Daniel. <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/daniel/daniel-9.html#Da9_24">Daniel&nbsp;9:24</a>")</I> .  <a href="/revelation/11-2.html">Revelation 11:2</a>  <a href="/revelation/11-3.html">Revelation 11:3</a>  The elements of the tribulation are: <P>(1) The cruel reign of the "beast out of the sea"  <a href="/revelation/13-1.html">Revelation 13:1</a>  who at the beginning of the three and a half years, will break his covenant with the Jews (by virtue of which they will have re-established the temple worship,  <a href="/daniel/9-27.html">Daniel 9:27</a>  and show himself in the temple, demanding that he be worshipped as God ;  <a href="/matthew/24-15.html">Matthew 24:15</a> ;  <a href="/2-thessalonians/2-4.html">2&nbsp;Thessalonians 2:4</a> . <P>(2) The active interposition of Satan "having great wrath"  <a href="/revelation/12-12.html">Revelation 12:12</a>  who gives his power to the Beast  <a href="/revelation/13-4.html">Revelation 13:4</a>  <a href="/revelation/13-5.html">Revelation 13:5</a> . <P>(3) The unprecedented activity of demons  <a href="/revelation/9-2.html">Revelation 9:2</a>  <a href="/revelation/9-11.html">Revelation 9:11</a>  and <P>(4) the terrible "bowl" judgments of Re 16. <P>The great tribulation will be, however, a period of salvation. An election out of Israel is seen as sealed for God  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Revelation+7:4-8">Revelation 7:4-8</a>  and, with an innumerable multitude of Gentiles  <a href="/revelation/7-9.html">Revelation 7:9</a>  are said to have come "out of the great tribulation"  <a href="/revelation/7-14.html">Revelation 7:14</a> . They are not of the priesthood, the church, to which they seem to stand somewhat in the relation of the Levites to the priests under the Mosaic Covenant.
