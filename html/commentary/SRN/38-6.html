		<span><B>Chapter 6</B></span><P><a href="/zechariah/6-1.html"><B>6&#058;1</B></a>&nbsp; And I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of brass. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>four chariots</span></B> <P>The interpretation of the tenth vision must be governed by the authoritative declaration of  <a href="/zechariah/6-5.html">Zechariah 6:5</a> . That which is symbolized by the four chariots with their horses is not the four world-empires of Daniel, but "the four spirits of heaven which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth" ( <a href="/zechariah/6-5.html">Zechariah 6:5</a> ). These "spirits" are angels ;  <a href="/luke/1-19.html">Luke 1:19</a> ;  <a href="/hebrews/1-14.html">Hebrews 1:14</a>  and are most naturally interpreted of the four angels of ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Revelation+7:1-3">Revelation 7:1-3</a> ;  <a href="/revelation/9-14.html">Revelation 9:14</a>  <a href="/revelation/9-15.html">Revelation 9:15</a> . These have also a ministry earthward, and of like nature with the "spirits" of  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Zechariah+6:1-8">Zechariah 6:1-8</a> . viz. judgment. The symbol (chariots and horses) is in perfect harmony with this. Always in Scripture symbolism they stand for the power of God earthward in judgment. ;  <a href="/jeremiah/46-9.html">Jeremiah 46:9</a>  <a href="/jeremiah/46-10.html">Jeremiah 46:10</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Joel+2:3-11">Joel 2:3-11</a>   <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Nahum+3:1-7">Nahum 3:1-7</a> . The vision, then, speaks of the Lord's judgments upon the Gentile nations north and south in the day of the Lord ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Isaiah+2:10-22">Isaiah 2:10-22</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Revelation+19:11-21">Revelation 19:11-21</a> . <P><P><P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/zechariah/6-4.html"><B>6&#058;4</B></a>&nbsp; Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me, What are these, my lord? <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>angel</span></B> <P><I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/hebrews/hebrews-1.html#Heb1_4">Hebrews&nbsp;1:4</a>")</I>  <P><P><P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/zechariah/6-5.html"><B>6&#058;5</B></a>&nbsp; And the angel answered and said unto me, These are the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>angel</span></B> <P><I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/hebrews/hebrews-1.html#Heb1_4">Hebrews&nbsp;1:4</a>")</I>  <P><P><P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/zechariah/6-11.html"><B>6&#058;11</B></a>&nbsp; Then take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them upon the head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest; <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>crowns</span></B> <P>Following the earth-judgments symbolized in the horsed chariots ( <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Zechariah+6:1-8">Zechariah 6:1-8</a> ) comes the manifestation of Christ in His kingdom glory ( <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Zechariah+6:9-15">Zechariah 6:9-15</a> ). This is the invariable prophetic order: first the judgments of the day of the Lord ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Isaiah+2:10-22">Isaiah 2:10-22</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Revelation+19:11-21">Revelation 19:11-21</a>  then the kingdom (cf) ;  <a href="/psalms/2-5.html">Psalms 2:5</a> ;  <a href="/psalms/2-6.html"> 2:6</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Isaiah+3:24-26">Isaiah 3:24-26</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Isaiah+4:2-6"> 4:2-6</a>  ;  <a href="/isaiah/10-33.html">Isaiah 10:33</a>  <a href="/isaiah/10-34.html">Isaiah 10:34</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Isaiah+11:1-10"> 11:1-10</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Revelation+19:19-21">Revelation 19:19-21</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Revelation+20:4-6"> 20:4-6</a> . This is set forth symbolically by the crowning of Joshua, which was not a vision, but actually done (cf) ;  <a href="/isaiah/8-3.html">Isaiah 8:3</a>  <a href="/isaiah/8-4.html">Isaiah 8:4</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Ezekiel+37:16-22">Ezekiel 37:16-22</a> . The fulfilment in the BRANCH will infinitely transcend the symbol. He "shall bear the glory" ;  <a href="/zechariah/6-13.html">Zechariah 6:13</a> ;  <a href="/matthew/16-27.html">Matthew 16:27</a> ;  <a href="/matthew/24-30.html"> 24:30</a> ;  <a href="/matthew/25-31.html"> 25:31</a>  as the Priest-King on His own throne ( <a href="/zechariah/6-12.html">Zechariah 6:12</a>  <a href="/zechariah/6-13.html">Zechariah 6:13</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Hebrews+7:1-3">Hebrews 7:1-3</a> ). Christ is now a Priest, but still in the holiest within the veil ;  <a href="/leviticus/16-15.html">Leviticus 16:15</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Hebrews+9:11-14">Hebrews 9:11-14</a>  <a href="/hebrews/9-24.html">Hebrews 9:24</a>  and seated on the Father's throne  <a href="/revelation/3-21.html">Revelation 3:21</a> . He has not yet come out to take His own throne  <a href="/hebrews/9-28.html">Hebrews 9:28</a> . The crowns made for the symbolical crowning of Joshua were to be laid up in the temple as a memorial to keep alive this larger hope of Israel. <P><P><P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/zechariah/6-12.html"><B>6&#058;12</B></a>&nbsp; And speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name is The BRANCH; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the LORD: <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>BRANCH</span></B> <P><I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/isaiah/isaiah-4.html#Isa4_2">Isaiah&nbsp;4:2</a>")</I>  <P><P><P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><!--pageCount=1-->
