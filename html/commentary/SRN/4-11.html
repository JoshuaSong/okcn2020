See Scofield " <a href="/exodus/16-35.html">Exodus 16:35</a> " will clamour for things pleasing to the flesh in the work and way of the church: sumptuous buildings, ornate ritual, an easy doctrine. Alas! they lead away the unspiritual believers also. <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/numbers/11-6.html"><B>11&#058;6</B></a>&nbsp; But now our soul is dried away: there is nothing at all, beside this manna, before our eyes. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>manna</span></B> <P><I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/exodus/exodus-16.html#Ex16_35">Exodus&nbsp;16:35</a>")</I> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/numbers/11-25.html"><B>11&#058;25</B></a>&nbsp; And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spake unto him, and took of the spirit that was upon him, and gave it unto the seventy elders: and it came to pass, that, when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, and did not cease. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>spirit that was upon him</span></B> <P>There was no more power than before--only more machinery. Moses had murmured ( <a href="/numbers/5-11.html">Numbers 5:11</a> ) because of the burden that God had laid upon him. God, in distributing the burden, shows that Moses' power had, all along, been in proportion to his burden. <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/numbers/11-31.html"><B>11&#058;31</B></a>&nbsp; And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a day's journey on this side, and as it were a day's journey on the other side, round about the camp, and as it were two cubits high upon the face of the earth. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>two cubits high upon the face of all the earth</span></B> <P>The correct rendering is, "about two cubits above the face of the earth," that is, within reach of the people that they might slay them for food. The statement is not that the quails were piled up from the face of the earth two cubits deep. The level of their flight was two cubits above the earth. <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/numbers/11-35.html"><B>11&#058;35</B></a>&nbsp; And the people journeyed from Kibrothhattaavah unto Hazeroth; and abode at Hazeroth. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>Kibroth-hattaavah</span></B> <P>i.e. graves of lust.  <a href="/numbers/33-17.html">Numbers 33:17</a>  <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><!--pageCount=1-->
