The reference to Meshech and Tubal (Moscow and Tobolsk) is a clear mark of identification. Russia and the northern powers have been the latest persecutors of dispersed Israel, and it is congruous both with divine justice and with the covenants (e.g. <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/genesis/genesis-15.html#Ge15_18">Genesis&nbsp;15:18</a>")</I> See Scofield " <a href="/deuteronomy/30-3.html">Deuteronomy 30:3</a> " that destruction should fall at the climax of the last mad attempt to exterminate the remnant of Israel in Jerusalem.
