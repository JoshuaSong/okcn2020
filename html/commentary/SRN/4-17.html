Aaron's priesthood had been questioned in the rebellion of Korah, so God Himself will confirm it  <a href="/numbers/17-5.html">Numbers 17:5</a> . Each of the tribe-heads brought a perfectly dead rod; God put life into Aaron's only. So all the authors of religions have died, Christ among them, but only Christ was raised from the dead, and exalted to be a high priest. ;  <a href="/hebrews/4-14.html">Hebrews 4:14</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Hebrews+5:4-10"> 5:4-10</a> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><!--pageCount=1-->
