Summary: The Greek word translated "remission" in  <a href="/matthew/26-28.html">Matthew 26:28</a> ;  <a href="/acts/10-43.html">Acts 10:43</a> ;  <a href="/hebrews/9-22.html">Hebrews 9:22</a>  is elsewhere rendered "forgiveness." It means, to send off, or away. And this, throughout Scripture, is the one fundamental meaning of forgiveness--to separate the sin from the sinner. Distinction must be made between divine and human forgiveness: <P>(1) Human forgiveness means the remission of penalty. In the Old Testament and the New, in type and fulfilment, the divine forgiveness follows the execution of the penalty. "The priest shall make an atonement for his sin that he had committed, and it shall be forgiven him"  <a href="/leviticus/4-35.html">Leviticus 4:35</a> . <P>"This is my blood of the new covenant, which is shed for many for the remission sending away, forgiveness of sins" ( <a href="/matthew/25-28.html">Matthew 25:28</a> ). "Without shedding of blood there is no remission"  <a href="/hebrews/9-22.html">Hebrews 9:22</a> . <P>See "Sacrifice" <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/genesis/genesis-4.html#Ge4_4">Genesis&nbsp;4:4</a>")</I> ;  <a href="/genesis/4-4.html">Genesis 4:4</a>  See Scofield " <a href="/hebrews/10-18.html">Hebrews 10:18</a> ". The sin of the justified believer interrupts his fellowship, and is forgiven upon confession, but always on the ground of Christ's propitiating sacrifice ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=1 John+1:6-9">1&nbsp;John 1:6-9</a> ;  <a href="/1-john/2-2.html"> 2:2</a> . <P>(2) Human forgiveness rests upon and results from the divine forgiveness. In many passages this is assumed rather than stated, but the principle is declared in  <a href="/ephesians/4-32.html">Ephesians 4:32</a> ;  <a href="/matthew/18-32.html">Matthew 18:32</a>  <a href="/matthew/18-33.html">Matthew 18:33</a> . <P><B><span>sins</span></B> Sin. <P><I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/romans/romans-3.html#Ro3_23">Romans&nbsp;3:23</a>")</I> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/matthew/26-29.html"><B>26&#058;29</B></a>&nbsp; But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>kingdom</span></B> <P><I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/matthew/matthew-3.html#Mt3_2">Matthew&nbsp;3:2</a>")</I> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/matthew/26-39.html"><B>26&#058;39</B></a>&nbsp; And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>cup</span></B> <P>The "cup" must be interpreted by our Lord's own use of that symbol in speaking of His approaching sacrificial death  <a href="/matthew/20-22.html">Matthew 20:22</a> ;  <a href="/john/18-11.html">John 18:11</a> .

The value of the account of the agony in the Garden is in the evidence it affords that He knew fully what the agony of the cross would mean when His soul was made an offering for sin,  <a href="/isaiah/53-10.html">Isaiah 53:10,</a>  in the hiding of the Father's face. Knowing the cost to the utmost, he voluntarily paid it. <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/matthew/26-45.html"><B>26&#058;45</B></a>&nbsp; Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>sinners</span></B> <P>Sin. <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/romans/romans-3.html#Ro3_23">Romans&nbsp;3:23</a>")</I> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/matthew/26-50.html"><B>26&#058;50</B></a>&nbsp; And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come?
