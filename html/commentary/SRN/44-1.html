Often these two aspects blend in one passage (e.g. Ps 2). The prophets themselves were perplexed by this seeming contradiction  <a href="/1-peter/1-10.html">1 Peter 1:10</a>  <a href="/1-peter/1-11.html">1 Peter 1:11</a> . It was solved by partial fulfilment. In due time the Messiah, born of a virgin according to Isaiah, appeared among men and began His ministry by announcing the predicted kingdom as "at hand." <P><I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/matthew/matthew-4.html#Mt4_17">Matthew&nbsp;4:17</a>")</I> .
