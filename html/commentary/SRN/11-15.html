It appears that local sacrifices to Jehovah (though not according to the divine order) were offered in the times of the kings upon "high places" (cf)  <a href="/1-samuel/9-12.html">1&nbsp;Samuel 9:12</a> . Apparently Asa's mother had defiled one of these with an idol,  <a href="/1-kings/15-13.html">1&nbsp;Kings 15:13</a> . Asa destroyed the idol and the idolatrous (but not the Jehovistic) "high places."
