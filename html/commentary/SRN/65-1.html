And this assurance rests only upon the Scripture promises to him who believes. <P><P><P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/jude/1-3.html"><B>1&#058;3</B></a>&nbsp; Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><P><B><span>salvation</span></B> <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/romans/romans-1.html#Ro1_16">Romans&nbsp;1:16</a>")</I> . <P><B><span>it was needful</span></B> Lit. constraint was upon me, i.e. of the Spirit. <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/jude/1-5.html"><B>1&#058;5</B></a>&nbsp; I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>saved</span></B> <P><I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/romans/romans-1.html#Ro1_16">Romans&nbsp;1:16</a>")</I> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/jude/1-6.html"><B>1&#058;6</B></a>&nbsp; And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><P><B><span>great day</span></B> <P>The judgment of the fallen angels. The "great day" is the day of the Lord  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Isaiah+2:9-22">Isaiah 2:9-22</a> . As the final judgment upon Satan occurs after the thousand years, and preceding the final judgment  <a href="/revelation/20-10.html">Revelation 20:10</a>  it is congruous to conclude, as to the time, that other fallen angels are judged with him ;  <a href="/2-peter/2-4.html">2&nbsp;Peter 2:4</a> ;  <a href="/revelation/20-10.html">Revelation 20:10</a> . Christians are associated with Christ in this judgment.

Compelled as a teacher of religion to explain atonement, the apostate teacher explains it away. <P><B><span>error of Balaam</span></B> <P>Balaam, the "error" of Balaam must be distinguished from his "way" <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/2-peter/2-peter-2.html#2Pe2_15">2&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;2:15</a>")</I> and his "doctrine" See Scofield " <a href="/revelation/2-14.html">Revelation 2:14</a> ". <P>The "error" of Balaam was that, reasoning from natural morality and seeing the evil in Israel, he supposed a righteous God must curse them. He was blind to the higher morality of the Cross, through which God maintains and enforces the authority and awful sanctions of His law, so that He can be just and the justifier of a believing sinner. The "reward" of  <a href="/jude/1-11.html">Jude 1:11</a>  may not be money, but popularity, or applause. <P><B><span>Core</span></B> <P>See Nu 16.

The regenerate man is not "in the sphere of the flesh," but in the sphere of the Spirit  <a href="/romans/8-9.html">Romans 8:9</a>  but the flesh is still in him, and he may, according to his choice, "walk after the flesh" or "in the Spirit" ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=1 Corinthians+3:1-4">1&nbsp;Corinthians 3:1-4</a> ;  <a href="/galatians/5-16.html">Galatians 5:16</a>  <a href="/galatians/5-17.html">Galatians 5:17</a> . In the first case he is a "carnal," in the second a "spiritual," Christian.
