		<span><B>Chapter 2</B></span><P><a href="/habakkuk/2-2.html"><B>2&#058;2</B></a>&nbsp; And the LORD answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>run that readeth it</span></B> <P>Not, as usually quoted, "that he that runneth may read," but, "that he may run that readeth"; i.e. as a messenger of the "vision." Cf.  <a href="/zechariah/2-4.html">Zechariah 2:4</a>  <a href="/zechariah/2-5.html">Zechariah 2:5</a>  <P><P><P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/habakkuk/2-3.html"><B>2&#058;3</B></a>&nbsp; For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>appointed time</span></B> <P>To the watching prophet comes the response of the "vision"  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Habakkuk+2:2-20">Habakkuk 2:2-20</a> ). Three elements are to be distinguished: <P>(1) The moral judgment of Jehovah upon the evils practised by dispersed Israel (Hab 5-13,15-19). <P>(2) The future purpose of God that, practised by dispersed Israel ( <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Habakkuk+2:5-13">Habakkuk 2:5-13</a>  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Habakkuk+2:15-19">Habakkuk 2:15-19</a> ). <P>(2) The future purpose of God that, "the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of Jehovah, as the waters cover the sea" ( <a href="/habakkuk/2-14.html">Habakkuk 2:14</a> ). That this revelation awaits the return of the Lord in glory is shown <P>(a) by the parallel passage in  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Isaiah+11:9-12">Isaiah 11:9-12</a>  and <P>(b) by the quotation of verse 3 in  <a href="/hebrews/10-37.html">Hebrews 10:37</a>  <a href="/hebrews/10-38.html">Hebrews 10:38</a>  where the "it" of the "vision" becomes "he" and refers to the return of the Lord. It is then, after the "vision" is fulfilled, that "the knowledge of the glory," etc, shall fill the earth. But <P>(3) meantime, "the just shall live by his faith." This great evangelic word is applied to Jew and Gentile in  <a href="/romans/1-17.html">Romans 1:17</a>  to the Gentiles in  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Galatians+3:11-14">Galatians 3:11-14</a>  and to Hebrews (especially) in  <a href="/hebrews/10-38.html">Hebrews 10:38</a> . This opening of life to faith alone, makes possible not only the salvation of the Gentiles during the dispersion of Israel "among the nations" ;  <a href="/habakkuk/1-5.html">Habakkuk 1:5</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Galatians+3:11-14">Galatians 3:11-14</a>  but also makes possible a believing remnant in Israel while the nation, as such, is in blindness and unbelief, <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/romans/romans-11.html#Ro11_1">Romans&nbsp;11:1</a>")</I> with neither priesthood nor temple, and consequently unable to keep the ordinances of the law. Such is Jehovah! In disciplinary government His ancient Israel is cast out of the land and judicially blinded  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=2 Corinthians+3:12-15">2&nbsp;Corinthians 3:12-15</a>  but in covenanted mercy the individual Jew may resort to the simple faith of Abraham ;  <a href="/genesis/15-6.html">Genesis 15:6</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Romans+4:1-5">Romans 4:1-5</a>  and be saved. But this does not set aside the Palestinian See Scofield " <a href="/deuteronomy/30-3.html">Deuteronomy 30:3</a> " and Davidic See Scofield " <a href="/2-samuel/7-16.html">2&nbsp;Samuel 7:16</a> ". Covenants, for "the earth shall be filled," etc. ( <a href="/habakkuk/2-14.html">Habakkuk 2:14</a> ),and Jehovah will again be in His temple ( <a href="/habakkuk/2-20.html">Habakkuk 2:20</a> ).

Habakkuk's phrase marks an advance on that of Isaiah. In the latter it is "the knowledge of the Lord." That, in a certain sense, is being diffused now; but in Habakkuk it is "the knowledge of the glory of the Lord," and that cannot be till He is manifested in glory ;  <a href="/matthew/24-30.html">Matthew 24:30</a> ;  <a href="/matthew/25-31.html"> 25:31</a> ;  <a href="/luke/9-26.html">Luke 9:26</a> ;  <a href="/2-thessalonians/1-7.html">2&nbsp;Thessalonians 1:7</a> ;  <a href="/2-thessalonians/2-8.html"> 2:8</a> ;  <a href="/jude/1-14.html">Jude 1:14</a> .
