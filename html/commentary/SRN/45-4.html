		<span><B>Chapter 4</B></span><P><a href="/romans/4-2.html"><B>4&#058;2</B></a>&nbsp; For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not before God. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>works</span></B> <P>Cf.  <a href="/james/2-24.html">James 2:24</a> . These are two aspects of one truth. Paul speaks of that which justifies man before God, viz.: faith alone, wholly apart from works; James of the proof before men, that he who professes to have justifying faith really has it. Paul speaks of what God sees--faith; James of what men see--works, as the visible evidence of faith. Paul draws his illustration from  <a href="/genesis/15-6.html">Genesis 15:6</a>  James from  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Genesis+22:1-19">Genesis 22:1-19</a> . James' key phrase is "ye see"  <a href="/james/2-24.html">James 2:24</a>  for men cannot see faith except as manifested through works. <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/romans/4-3.html"><B>4&#058;3</B></a>&nbsp; For what saith the scripture?
