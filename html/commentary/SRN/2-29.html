The robe was secured by a golden girdle. <P>(3) The ephod  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Exodus+28:5-12">Exodus 28:5-12</a>  was next put on. A short garment made of linen, embroidered with gold, blue, purple, and scarlet, it consisted of two pieces, front and back, united by two shoulder-pieces and by a band about the bottom. Two onyx stones, set in gold and fastened upon the shoulder-pieces of the ephod, were engraved with the names of the twelve tribes: "and Aaron shall bear their names before Jehovah upon his two shoulders (the place of strength) for a memorial." Cf. ;  <a href="/isaiah/9-6.html">Isaiah 9:6</a> ;  <a href="/luke/15-4.html">Luke 15:4</a>  <a href="/luke/15-5.html">Luke 15:5</a> . <P>(4) The breastplate was a square pouch  <a href="/exodus/28-16.html">Exodus 28:16</a>  of linen to contain the Urim and Thummim. <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/exodus/exodus-28.html#Ex28_30">Exodus&nbsp;28:30</a>")</I> . <P>To the linen pouch was attached the oblong gold setting containing four rows of precious stones, on each stone a tribal name. The breastplate with the jewel work was attached at the upper corners to the shoulder-pieces of the ephod by golden chains. Golden rings were sewn on ephod and breastplate, and the latter was further secured to the ephod by laces of blue through the rings. Altogether, it was called "the breastplate of judgment" because worn by the high priest when judging the causes of the people. <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/exodus/exodus-28.html#Ex28_30">Exodus&nbsp;28:30</a>")</I> . <P>(5) A mitre (or "turban") of fine line was made  <a href="/exodus/28-37.html">Exodus 28:37</a>  to cover the head, bearing upon the front a gold plate engraved, "Holiness to the Lord"  <a href="/exodus/29-36.html">Exodus 29:36</a> . <P>(6) To these were added linen breeches, "from the loins even to the thighs"  <a href="/exodus/28-42.html">Exodus 28:42</a> .

The English word "atonement" (at-one-ment) is not a translation of the Heb. kaphar, but a translator's interpretation. According to Scripture the legal sacrifice "covered" the offerer's sin and secured the divine forgiveness; according to the translators it made God and the sinner at- one. But the O.T. sacrifices did not at-one the sinner and God. "It is not possible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins."  <a href="/hebrews/10-4.html">Hebrews 10:4</a> . The Israelite's offering implied confession of sin and of its due desert, death; and God "covered" (passed over,"  <a href="/romans/3-25.html">Romans 3:25</a>  his sin, in anticipation of Christ's sacrifice, which did, finally, "put away" the sins "done aforetime in the forbearance of God." ;  <a href="/romans/3-25.html">Romans 3:25</a> ;  <a href="/hebrews/9-15.html">Hebrews 9:15</a> . <I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/romans/romans-3.html#Ro3_25">Romans&nbsp;3:25</a>")</I> .
