		<span><B>Chapter 11</B></span><P><a href="/romans/11-1.html"><B>11&#058;1</B></a>&nbsp; I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>cast</span></B> <P>That Israel has not been forever set aside is the theme of this chapter. <P>(1) The salvation of Paul proves that there is still a remnant ( <a href="/romans/11-1.html">Romans 11:1</a> ) <P>(2) The doctrine of the remnant proves it ( <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Romans+11:2-6">Romans 11:2-6</a> ). <P>(3) The present national unbelief was foreseen ( <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Romans+11:7-10">Romans 11:7-10</a> ). <P>(4) Israel's unbelief is the Gentile opportunity ( <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Romans+11:11-25">Romans 11:11-25</a> ). <P>(5) Israel is judicially broken off from the good olive tree, Christ ( <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Romans+11:17-22">Romans 11:17-22</a> ). <P>(6) They are to be grafted in again ( <a href="/romans/11-23.html">Romans 11:23</a>  <a href="/romans/11-24.html">Romans 11:24</a> ). <P>(7) The promised Deliverer will come out of Zion and the nation will be saved ( <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Romans+11:25-29">Romans 11:25-29</a> ). That the Christian now inherits the distinctive Jewish promises is not taught in Scripture. The Christian is of the heavenly seed of Abraham ;  <a href="/genesis/15-5.html">Genesis 15:5</a>  <a href="/genesis/15-6.html">Genesis 15:6</a> ;  <a href="/galatians/3-29.html">Galatians 3:29</a>  and partakes of the spiritual blessings of the Abrahamic Covenant. <P><I>(See Scofield "<a href="/commentaries/scofield-reference-notes/genesis/genesis-15.html#Ge15_18">Genesis&nbsp;15:18</a>")</I> but Israel as a nation always has it own place, and is yet to have its greatest exaltation as the earthly people of God. See "Israel"  <a href="/genesis/12-2.html">Genesis 12:2</a> ;  <a href="/romans/11-26.html">Romans 11:26</a>  "Kingdom" ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Genesis+1:26-28">Genesis 1:26-28</a> ;  <a href="/zechariah/12-8.html">Zechariah 12:8</a> . <P>For Another Point of View: See Topic 301242 <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/romans/11-5.html"><B>11&#058;5</B></a>&nbsp; Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace. <BLOCKQUOTE><P><P><B><span>Remnant</span></B> <P>Remnant, Summary: In the history of Israel, a "remnant" may be discerned, a spiritual Israel within the national Israel. In Elijah's time 7,000 had not bowed the knee to Baal  <a href="/1-kings/19-18.html">1&nbsp;Kings 19:18</a> . In Isaiah's time it was the "very small remnant" for whose sake God still forbore to destroy the nation  <a href="/isaiah/1-9.html">Isaiah 1:9</a> . During the captivities the remnant appears in Jews like Ezekiel, Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, Esther, and Mordecai. At the end of the 70 years of Babylonian captivity it was the remnant which returned under Ezra and Nehemiah. At the advent of our Lord, John the Baptist, Simeon, Anna, and "them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem"  <a href="/luke/2-38.html">Luke 2:38</a>  were the remnant. During the church-age the remnant is composed of believing Jews  <a href="/romans/11-4.html">Romans 11:4</a>  <a href="/romans/11-5.html">Romans 11:5</a> . But the chief interest in the remnant is prophetic. During the great tribulation a remnant out of all Israel will turn to Jesus as Messiah, and will become His witnesses after the removal of the church  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Revelation+7:3-8">Revelation 7:3-8</a> . Some of these will undergo martyrdom  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Revelation+6:9-11">Revelation 6:9-11</a>  some will be spared to enter the millennial kingdom  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Zechariah+12:6-13;Zechariah+12:9">Zechariah 12:6-13:9</a> . Many of the Psalms express, prophetically, the joys and sorrows of the tribulation remnant. <P><B><span>remnant</span></B> Remnant.
