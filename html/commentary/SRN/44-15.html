Peter used the keys first for the Jews on the day of Pentecost; secondly, in the house of Cornelius for the Gentiles,  <a href="/acts/15-14.html">Acts 15:14,</a>  But Paul was distinctively the apostle to the Gentiles.  <a href="/galatians/2-7.html">Galatians 2:7</a>  <a href="/galatians/2-8.html">Galatians 2:8</a> . <P><P><P></BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/acts/15-13.html"><B>15&#058;13</B></a>&nbsp; And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men and brethren, hearken unto me: <BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><span>Men and brethren</span></B> <P>Dispensationally, this is the most important passage in the N.T. It gives the divine purpose for this age, and for the beginning of the next. <P>(1) The taking out from among the Gentiles of a people for His name, the distinctive work of the present, or church-age. The church is the ecclesia--the "called-out assembly." Precisely this has been in progress since Pentecost. The Gospel has never anywhere converted all, but everywhere has called out some. <P>(2) "After this viz. the out-calling I will return." James quotes from  <a href="/amos/9-11.html">Amos 9:11</a>  <a href="/amos/9-12.html">Amos 9:12</a> . The verses which follow in Amos describe the final regathering of Israel, which the other prophets invariably connect with the fulfilment of the Davidic Covenant (e.g.) ;  <a href="/isaiah/11-1.html">Isaiah 11:1</a>  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Isaiah+11:10-12">Isaiah 11:10-12</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Jeremiah+23:5-8">Jeremiah 23:5-8</a> . <P>(3) "And will build again the tabernacle of David," i.e. re-establish the Davidic rule over Israel  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=2 Samuel+7:8-17">2&nbsp;Samuel 7:8-17</a> ;  <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Luke+1:31-33">Luke 1:31-33</a> . <P>(4) "That the residue of men Israelites may seek after the Lord" cf  <a href="/zechariah/12-7.html">Zechariah 12:7</a>  <a href="/zechariah/12-8.html">Zechariah 12:8</a> ;  <a href="/zechariah/13-1.html">Zechariah 13:1</a>  <a href="/zechariah/13-2.html">Zechariah 13:2</a> . <P>(5) "And all the Gentiles," etc. cf  <a href="/micah/4-2.html">Micah 4:2</a> ;  <a href="/zechariah/8-21.html">Zechariah 8:21</a>  <a href="/zechariah/8-22.html">Zechariah 8:22</a> .

The whole question of the relation of the law to Gentile believers had been put in issue ( <a href="/acts/15-5.html">Acts 15:5</a> ), and their exemption is declared in the decision ( <a href="/acts/15-19.html">Acts 15:19</a>  <a href="/acts/15-24.html">Acts 15:24</a> ). The decision might be otherwise stated in the terms of  <a href="/romans/6-14.html">Romans 6:14</a> . "Ye are not under the law, but under grace."
