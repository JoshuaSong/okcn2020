		<span id="Page-1" style=""><b><a href="/matthew/27.html">Chapter&nbsp;27</a></b><P>It is a very affecting story which is recorded in this chapter concerning the sufferings and death of our Lord Jesus. Considering the thing itself, there cannot be a more tragical story told us; common humanity would melt the heart, to find an innocent and excellent person thus misused. But considering the design and fruit of Christ&#146;s sufferings, it is gospel, it is good news, that Jesus Christ was thus delivered for our offences; and there is nothing we have more reason to glory in than the cross of Christ. In this chapter, observe, <I>I. How he was prosecuted. 1. The delivering of him to Pilate (<a href="/matthew/27-1.html">v.&nbsp;1</a>, <a href="/matthew/27-2.html">v.&nbsp;2</a>). The despair of Judas (<a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=matthew+27:3-10">v.&nbsp;3-10</a>). The arraignment and trial of Christ before Pilate (<a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=matthew+27:11-14">v.&nbsp;11-14</a>). The clamours of the people against him (<a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=matthew+27:15-25">v.&nbsp;15-25</a>). Sentence passed, and the warrant signed for his execution (<a href="/matthew/27-26.html">v.&nbsp;26</a>). II. How he was executed. 1. He was barbarously used (<a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=matthew+27:27-30">v.&nbsp;27-30</a>). Led to the place of execution (<a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=matthew+27:31-33">v.&nbsp;31-33</a>). There he had all possible indignities done him, and reproaches cast upon him (<a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=matthew+27:34-44">v.&nbsp;34-44</a>). Heaven frowned upon him (<a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=matthew+27:45-49">v.&nbsp;45-49</a>). Many remarkable things attended his death (<a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=matthew+27:50-56">v.&nbsp;50-56</a>). He was buried and a watch set on his grave (<a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=matthew+27:57-66">v.&nbsp;57-66</a>).</I></p><p><a name="Mt27_1"></a><a name="Mt27_2"></a><a name="Mt27_3"></a><a name="Mt27_4"></a><a name="Mt27_5"></a><a name="Mt27_6"></a><a name="Mt27_7"></a><a name="Mt27_8"></a><a name="Mt27_9"></a><a name="Mt27_10"></a> <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Matthew+27:1-10">Verses 1-10</a> We left Christ in the hands of the chief priests and elders, condemned to die, but they could only show their teeth; about two years before this the Romans had taken from the Jews the power of capital punishment; they could put no man to death, and therefore early in the morning another council is held, to consider what is to be done. And here we are told what was done in that morning-council, after they had been for two or three hours consulting with their pillows.I. Christ is delivered up to Pilate, that he might execute the sentence they had passed upon him. Judea having been almost one hundred years before this conquered by Pompey, had ever since been tributary to Rome, and was lately made part of the province of Syria, and subject to the government of the president of Syria, under whom there were several <I>procurators,</I> who chiefly attended the business of the <I>revenues,</I> but sometimes, as Pilate particularly, had the whole power of the president lodged in them. This was a plain evidence that <I>the sceptre was </I> <I>departed from Judah,</I> and that therefore now <I>the Shilloh must come,</I> according to Jacob&#146;s prophecy, <a href="/genesis/49-10.html">Gen.&nbsp;49:10</a> . Pilate is characterized by the Roman writers of that time, as a man of a rough and haughty spirit, wilful and implacable, and extremely covetous and oppressive; the Jews had a great enmity to his person, and were weary of his government, and yet they made use of him as the tool of their malice against Christ.1. They <I>bound</I> Jesus. He was bound when he was first seized; but either they took off these bonds when he was before the council, or now they added to them. Having found him guilty, they tied his hands behind him, as they usually do with convicted criminals. He was already bound with the bonds of love to man, and of his own undertaking, else he had soon broken these bonds, as Samson did his. We were fettered with the <I>bond of iniquity,</I> held in the cords of our sins (<a href="/proverbs/10-22.html">Prov.&nbsp;10:22</a> ); but God had bound the <I>yoke of our transgressions</I> upon the neck of the Lord Jesus (<a href="/lamentations/50-14.html">Lam.&nbsp;50:14</a> ), that we might be loosed by his bonds, as we are <I>healed by his </I> <I>stripes.</I> 2. <I>They led him away</I> in a sort of triumph, led him <I>as a lamb to the slaughter;</I> so <I>was he </I> <I>taken from prison and from judgment,</I> <a href="/isaiah/53-7.html">Isa.&nbsp;53:7</a>, <a href="/isaiah/53-8.html">Isa.&nbsp;53:8</a> . It was nearly a mile from Caiaphas&#146;s house to Pilate&#146;s. All that way they led him through the streets of Jerusalem, when in the morning they began to fill, to make him a spectacle to the world.3. They <I>delivered him to Pontius Pilate;</I> according to that which Christ had often said, that he should be <I>delivered to the Gentiles.</I> Both Jews and Gentiles were obnoxious to the judgment of God, and <I>concluded under sin,</I> and Christ was to be the Saviour both of Jews and Gentiles; and therefore Christ was brought into the judgment both of Jews and Gentiles, and both had a hand in his death. See how these corrupt church-rulers abused the civil magistrate, making use of him to execute their unrighteous decrees, and <I>inflict the grievance which they had prescribed,</I> <a href="/isaiah/10-1.html">Isa.&nbsp;10:1</a> . Thus have the kings of the earth been wretchedly imposed upon by the papal powers, and condemned to the drudgery of extirpating with the sword of war, as well as that of justice, those whom they have marked for heretics, right or wrong, to the great prejudice of their own interests.II. The money which they had paid to Judas for betraying Christ, is by him delivered back to them, and Judas, in despair, hangs himself. The chief priests and elders supported themselves with <I>this,</I> in prosecuting Christ, that his own disciple betrayed him to them; but now, in the midst of the prosecution, that string failed them, and even <I>he</I> is made to them a <I>witness</I> of Christ&#146;s innocency and a monument of God&#146;s justice; which served, 1. For glory to Christ in the midst of his sufferings, and a specimen of his victory over Satan who had entered into <a href="/jude/2.html">Judas.&nbsp;2</a>, . For warning to his persecutors, and to leave them the more inexcusable. If their heart had not been fully set in them to do this evil, what Judas said and did, one would think, should have stopped the prosecution.(1.) See here how Judas <I>repented:</I> not like Peter, who repented, believed, and was pardoned: no, he repented, despaired, and was ruined. Now observe here,[1.] What induced him to repent. It was <I>when he saw that he was condemned.</I> Judas, it is probable, expected that either Christ would have made his escape out of their hands, or would so have pleaded his own cause at their bar as to have come off, and then Christ would have had the honour, the Jews the shame, and he the money, and no harm done. This he had no reason to expect, because he had so often heard his Master say that he must be <I>crucified;</I> yet it is probable that he did expect it, and when the event did not answer his vain fancy, then he fell into this horror, when he saw the stream strong against Christ, and him yielding to it. Note, Those who measure actions by the consequences of them rather than by the divine law, will find themselves mistaken in their measures. The way of sin is down-hill; and if we cannot easily stop ourselves, much less can we stop others whom we have set a going in a sinful way. He <I>repented </I> <I>himself;</I> that is, he was filled with grief, anguish, and indignation, at himself, when reflecting upon what he had done. When he was tempted to betray his Master, the thirty pieces of silver looked very fine and glittering, like the <I>wine, when it is red, and gives its colour in the cup.</I> But when the thing was done, and the money paid, the silver was become dross, it <I>bit like a serpent, and </I> <I>stung like an adder.</I> Now his conscience flew in his face; &quot;What have I done! What a fool, what a wretch, am I, to sell my Master, and all my comfort and happiness in him, for such a trifle! All these abuses and indignities done him are chargeable upon me; it is owing to me, that he is bound and condemned, spit upon and buffeted. I little thought it would have come to this, when I made that wicked bargain; so foolish was I, and ignorant, and so like a beast.&#146;&#146; Now he curses the bag he carried, the money he coveted, the priests he dealt with, and the day that he was born. The remembrance of his Master&#146;s goodness to him, which he had so basely requited, the bowels of mercy he had spurned at, and the fair warnings he had slighted, steeled his convictions, and made them the more piercing. Now he found his Master&#146;s words true; <I>It </I> <I>were better for that man, that he had never been born.</I> Note, Sin will soon change its taste. Though it be <I>rolled under the tongue</I> as a <I>sweet morsel,</I> in the bowels it will be turned into the <I>gall of asps</I> (<a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=job+20:12-14">Job.&nbsp;20:12-14</a> ), like John&#146;s book, <a href="/revelation/10-9.html">Rev.&nbsp;10:9</a> .[2.] What were the indications of his repentance.<I>First,</I> He made restitution; <I>He brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests,</I> when they were all together publicly. Now the money burned in his conscience, and he was as sick of it as ever he had been fond of it. Note, That which is ill gotten, will never do good to those that get it, <a href="/jeremiah/13-10.html">Jer.&nbsp;13:10</a> ; <a href="/job/20-15.html">Job.&nbsp;20:15</a> . If he had repented, and brought the money back before he had betrayed Christ, he might have done it with comfort, then he had <I>agreed while yet in the </I> <I>way;</I> but now it was too late, now he cannot do it without horror, wishing ten thousand times he had never meddled with it. See <a href="/james/5-3.html">Jam.&nbsp;5:3</a> . He brought it again. Note, what is unjustly gotten, must not be kept; for that is a continuance in the sin by which it was got, and such an avowing of it as is not consistent with repentance. He brought it to those from whom he had it, to let them know that he repented his bargain. Note, Those who have served and hardened others in their sin, when God gives them repentance, should let them know it whose sins they have been partakers in, that it may be a means to bring them to repentance.<I>Secondly,</I> He made confession (<a href="/matthew/27-4.html">v.&nbsp;4</a>); <I>I have sinner, in that I have betrayed innocent blood.</I> 1. To the <I>honour of Christ,</I> he pronounces his blood <I>innocent.</I> If he had been guilty of any sinful practices, Judas, as his disciple, would certainly have know it, and, as his betrayer, would certainly have discovered it; but he, freely and without being urged to it, pronounces him innocent, to the face of those who had pronounced him <I>guilty.</I> 2. To <I>his own shame,</I> he confesses that he had sinned, in betraying this blood. He does not lay the blame on any one else; does not say, &quot;You have sinned, in hiring me to do it;&#146;&#146; but takes it all to himself; &quot;I have sinned, in doing it.&#146;&#146; Thus far Judas went toward his repentance, yet it was <I>not to salvation.</I> He confessed, but not to God, did not go to him, and say, <I>I have sinned, Father, against heaven.</I> He confessed the betraying of innocent blood, but did not confess that wicked love of money, which was the root of this evil. There are those who betray Christ, and yet justify themselves in it, and so come short of Judas.(2.) See here how the chief priests and elders entertained Judas&#146;s penitential confession; they said, <I>What is that to us? See thou to that.</I> He made them his confessors, and that was the <I>absolution</I> they gave him; more like the priests of devils than like the priests of the holy living God.[1.] See here how carelessly they speak of the betraying of Christ. Judas had told them that the blood of Christ was innocent blood; and they said, <I>What is that to us?</I> Was it nothing to them that they had thirsted after this blood, and hired Judas to betray it, and had now condemned it to be shed unjustly? Is this nothing to them? Does it give no check to the violence of their prosecution, no warning to take need what they do to this just man? Thus do fools make a mock at sin, as if no harm were done, no hazard run, by the commission of the greatest wickedness. Thus light do many make of Christ crucified; what is it to them, that he suffered such things?[2.] See here how carelessly they speak of the sin of Judas; he said, <I>I have sinned,</I> and they said, <I>&quot;What is that to us?</I> What are we concerned in thy sin, that thou tellest us of it?&#146;&#146; Note, It is folly for us to think that the sins of others are nothing to us, especially those sins that we are any way accessary to, or partakers in. Is it nothing to us, that God is dishonoured, souls wounded, Satan gratified and his interests served, and that we have aided and abetted it? If the elders of Jezreel, to please Jezebel, murder Naboth, is that nothing to Ahab? Yes, <I>he has killed,</I> for he has <I>taken possession,</I> <a href="/1-kings/21-19.html">1 Ki.&nbsp;21:19</a> . The guilt of sin is not so easily transferred as some people think it is. If there were guilt in the matter, they tell Judas that he must <I>look to it,</I> he must <I>bear </I> <I>it. First,</I> Because he had betrayed him to them. His was indeed <I>the greater sin</I> (<a href="/john/19-11.html">Jn.&nbsp;19:11</a> ); but it did not therefore follow, that theirs was no sin. It is a common instance of the deceitfulness of our hearts, to extenuate our own sin by the aggravation of other people&#146;s sins. But the judgment of God is according to truth, not according to comparison. <I>Secondly,</I> Because he knew and believed him to be innocent. &quot;If he be innocent, see thou to it, that is more than we know; we have adjudged him <I>guilty,</I> and therefore may justly prosecute him as such,&#146;&#146; Wicked practices are buoyed up by wicked principles, and particularly by this, That sin is sin only to those that think it to be so; that it is no harm to persecute a good man, if we take him to be a bad man; but those who thus think to mock God, will but deceive and destroy themselves.[3.] See how carelessly they speak of the conviction, terror, and remorse, that Judas was under. They were glad to make use of him in the sin, and were then very fond of him; none more welcome to them than Judas, when he said, <I>What will ye give me, and I will betray him to </I> <I>you?</I> They did not say, <I>What is that to us?</I> But now that his sin had put him into a fright, now they slighted him, had nothing to say to him, but turned him over to his own terrors; why did he come to trouble them with his melancholy fancies? They had something else to do than to heed him. But why so shy? <I>First,</I> Perhaps they were in some fear lest the sparks of his conviction, brought too near, should kindle a fire in their own consciences, and lest his moans, listened to, should give an alarm to their own convictions. Note, Obstinate sinners stand upon their guard against convictions; and those that are resolvedly impenitent, look with disdain upon the penitent. <I>Secondly,</I> However, they were in no concern to succour Judas; when they had brought him into the snare, they not only left him, but laughed at him. Note, Sinners, under convictions, will find their old companions in sin but miserable comforters. It is usual for those that love the treason, to hate the traitor.(3.) Here is the utter despair that Judas was hereby driven into. If the chief priests had promised him to stay the prosecution, it would have been some comfort to him; but, seeing no hopes of that, he grew desperate, <a href="/matthew/27-5.html">v.&nbsp;5</a>.[1.] <I>He cast down the pieces of silver in the temple.</I> The chief priests would not take the money, for fear of taking thereby the whole guilt to themselves, which they were willing that Judas should bear the load of; Judas would not keep it, it was too hot for him to hold, he therefore threw it down in the temple, that, whether they would or no, it might fall into the hands of the chief priests. See what a <I>drug</I> money was, when the guilt of <I>sin</I> was tacked to it, or was thought to be so.[2.] <I>He went, and hanged himself. First, He retired</I> &#151;<I>anechorese</I> ; he withdrew into some solitary place, like the possessed man that was drawn by the devil into the wilderness, <a href="/luke/8-29.html">Lu.&nbsp;8:29</a> . Woe to him that is in despair, and is alone. If Judas had gone to Christ, or to some of the disciples, perhaps he might have had relief, bad as the case was; but, missing of it with the chief priests, he abandoned himself to despair: and the same devil that with the help of the priests drew him to the sin, with their help drove him to despair. <I>Secondly,</I> He became his own executioner; <I>He hanged himself;</I> he was <I>suffocated</I> with grief, so Dr. Hammond: but Dr. Whitby is clear that our translation is right. Judas had a <I>sight</I> and <I>sense</I> of sin, but no apprehension of the mercy of God in Christ, and so <I>he pined away in his iniquity.</I> His sin, we may suppose, was not in its own nature unpardonable: there were some of those saved, that had been Christ&#146;s betrayers and murderers; but he concluded, as Cain, that his iniquity was greater than could be forgiven, and would rather throw himself on the devil&#146;s mercy than God&#146;s. And some have said, that Judas sinned more in <I>despairing</I> of the mercy of God, than in <I>betraying</I> his Master&#146;s blood. Now the terrors of the Almighty set themselves in array against him. All the curses written in God&#146;s book now <I>came into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones,</I> as was foretold concerning him (<a href="/psalms/109-18.html">Ps.&nbsp;109:18</a>, <a href="/psalms/109-19.html">Ps.&nbsp;109:19</a> ), and drove him to this desperate shift, for the escaping of a <I>hell</I> within him, to leap into <I>that</I> before him, which was but the perfection and perpetuity of this horror and despair. He throws himself into the fire, to avoid the flame; but miserable is the case when a man must go to hell for ease.Now, in this story, 1. We have an instance of the wretched end of those into whom Satan enters, and particularly those that are given up to the love of money. This is the destruction in which many are drowned by it, <a href="/1-timothy/6-9.html">1 Tim.&nbsp;6:9</a>, <a href="/1-timothy/6-10.html">1 Tim.&nbsp;6:10</a> . Remember what became of the swine into which, and of the traitor into whom, <I>the devil enters;</I> and <I>give not place to the devil.</I> 2. We have an instance of the wrath of God revealed from heaven against the ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, <a href="/romans/1-18.html">Rom.&nbsp;1:18</a> . As in the story of Peter we behold the goodness of God, and the triumphs of Christ&#146;s grace in the conversion of some sinners; so in the story of Judas we behold the severity of God, and the triumphs of Christ&#146;s power and justice in the confusion of other sinners. When Judas, into whom Satan entered, was thus <I>hung up,</I> Christ made an open show of the principalities and powers he undertook the <I>spoiling of,</I> <a href="/colossians/2-15.html">Col.&nbsp;2:15</a> . We have an instance of the direful effects of despair; it often ends in self-murder. <I>Sorrow,</I> even that for sin, if not <I>according to God, worketh death</I> (<a href="/2-corinthians/7-10.html">2 Co.&nbsp;7:10</a> ), the worst kind of death; for <I>a wounded </I> <I>spirit, who can bear?</I> Let us think as bad as we can of sin, provided we do not think it unpardonable; let us despair of help in ourselves, but not of help in God. He that thinks to ease his conscience by destroying his life, doth, in effect, dare God Almighty to do his worst. And self-murder, though prescribed by some of the heathen moralists, is certainly a remedy worse than the disease, how bad soever the disease may be. Let us watch against the beginnings of melancholy, and pray, Lord, <I>lead us not into temptation.</I> (4.) The disposal of the money which Judas brought back, <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=matthew+27:6-10">v.&nbsp;6-10</a>. It was laid out in the purchase of a field, called <I>the potter&#146;s field;</I> because some potter had owned it, or occupied it, or lived near it, or because broken potters&#146; vessels were thrown into it. And this field was to be a burying-place for strangers, that is, proselytes to the Jewish religion, who were of other nations, and, coming to Jerusalem to worship, happened to die there. [1.] It looks like an instance of their humanity, that they took care for the <I>burying of strangers;</I> and it intimates that they themselves allowed (as St. Paul saith, <a href="/acts/24-15.html">Acts.&nbsp;24:15</a> ), <I>that there shall be a resurrection of the </I> <I>dead, both of the just and of the unjust;</I> for we <I>therefore</I> take care of the dead body, not only because it has been the habitation of a rational soul, but because it must be so again. But, [2.] It was no instance of their humility that they would bury strangers in a place by themselves, as if they were not worthy to be laid in their burying-places; strangers must keep their distance, alive and dead, and that principle must go down to the grace, <I>Stand by thyself, come not near me, I </I> <I>am holier than thou,</I> <a href="/isaiah/65-5.html">Isa.&nbsp;65:5</a> . The sons of Seth were better affected towards Abraham, though a stranger among them, when they offered him the choicest of their own sepulchres, <a href="/genesis/23-6.html">Gen.&nbsp;23:6</a> . But <I>the sons of the stranger, that have joined themselves to the Lord,</I> though buried by themselves, shall rise with all that are <I>dead in Christ.</I> This buying of the potter&#146;s field did not take place on the day that Christ died (they were then too busy to mind any thing else but hunting him down); but it took place not long after; for Peter speaks of it soon after Christ&#146;s ascension; yet it is here recorded.<I>First,</I> To show the hypocrisy of the chief priests and elders. They were maliciously persecuting the blessed Jesus, and now,1. They scruple to put that money into the treasury, or <I>corban,</I> of the temple, with which they had hired the traitor. Though perhaps they had taken it out of the treasury, pretending it was for the public good, and though they were great sticklers for the <I>corban,</I> and laboured to draw all the wealth of the nation into it, yet they would not put that money into it, which was the price of blood. The hire of a traitor they thought parallel to the hire of a whore, and the price of a malefactor (such a one they made Christ to be) equivalent to the price of a dog, neither of which was to be <I>brought into the house of the Lord,</I> <a href="/deuteronomy/23-18.html">Deu.&nbsp;23:18</a> . They would thus save their credit with the people, by possessing them with an opinion of their great reverence for the temple. Thus they that <I>swallowed a camel, strained at a gnat.</I> 2. They think to <I>atone</I> for what they had done, by this public good act of providing a burying-place for strangers, though not at their own charge. Thus in times of ignorance people were made to believe that building churches and endowing monasteries would make amends for immoralities.<I>Secondly,</I> To signify the favour intended by the blood of Christ to <I>strangers,</I> and sinners of the Gentiles. Through the price of his blood, a resting place is provided for them after death. Thus many of the ancients apply this passage. The <I>grave</I> is the potter&#146;s field, where the bodies are thrown as despised broken vessels; but Christ by his blood <I>purchased</I> it for those who by confessing themselves <I>strangers</I> on earth seek the better country; he has altered the property of it (as a purchaser doth), so that now death is ours, the grave is ours, a bed of rest for us. The Germans, in their language, call burying-places <I>God&#146;s fields;</I> for in them God <I>sows</I> his people as a <I>corn of wheat,</I> <a href="/john/12-24.html">Jn.&nbsp;12:24</a> . See <a href="/hosea/2-23.html">Hos.&nbsp;2:23</a> ; <a href="/isaiah/26-19.html">Isa.&nbsp;26:19</a> .<I>Thirdly,</I> To perpetuate the infamy of those that bought and sold the blood of Christ. This field was commonly called <I>Aceldama&#151;the field of blood;</I> not by the chief priests, they hoped in this burying-place to bury the remembrance of their own crime; but by the people; who took notice of Judas&#146;s acknowledgment that he had betrayed the innocent blood, though the chief priests made nothing of it. They fastened this name upon the field <I>in perpetuam rei </I> <I>memoriam&#151;for a perpetual memorial.</I> Note, Divine Providence has many ways of entailing disgrace upon the wicked practices even of great men, who, though they seek to cover their shame, are <I>put to a perpetual reproach.</I> Fourthly, That we may see how the scripture was fulfilled (<a href="/matthew/27-9.html">v.&nbsp;9</a>, <a href="/matthew/27-10.html">v.&nbsp;10</a>); <I>Then was fulfilled that </I> <I>which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet.</I> The words quoted are found in the prophecy of Zechariah, <a href="/matthew/11-12.html">ch.&nbsp;11:12</a> . How they are here said to be spoken by Jeremy is a difficult question; but the credit of Christ&#146;s doctrine does not depend upon it; for that proves itself perfectly divine, though there should appear something human as to small circumstances in the penmen of it. The Syriac version, which is ancient, reads only, <I>It was spoken by the prophet,</I> not naming any, whence some have thought that <I>Jeremy</I> was added by some scribe; some think that the whole volume of the prophets, being in one book, and the prophecy of Jeremiah put first, it might not be improper, <I>currente calamo&#151;for a transcriber</I> to quote any passage out of that volume, under his name. The Jews used to say, <I>The spirit of Jeremiah was in Zechariah,</I> and so they were as one prophet. Some suggest that it was <I>spoken</I> by Jeremiah, but written by Zechariah; or that Jeremiah wrote the ninth, tenth, and eleventh chapters of Zechariah. Now this passage in the prophet is a representation of the great contempt of God, that was found among the Jews, and the poor returns they made to him for rich receivings from him. But here that is really acted, which was there but figuratively expressed. The sum of money is the same&#151;<I>thirty pieces of </I> <I>silver;</I> this they <I>weighed for his price,</I> at this rate they valued him; a goodly price; and this was <I>cast to the potter in the house of the Lord;</I> which was here literally accomplished. Note, We should better understand the events of Providence, if we were better acquainted even with the language and expressions of scripture; for even those also are sometimes written upon the dispensations of Providence so plainly, that <I>he who runs may read them.</I> What David spoke figuratively (<a href="/psalms/42-7.html">Ps.&nbsp;42:7</a> ), Jonah made a literal application of; <I>All thy waves and thy billows are </I> <I>gone over me,</I> <a href="/jonah/3-3.html">Jonah.&nbsp;3:3</a> .The giving of the price of him that was valued, not for him, but for the <I>potter&#146;s field,</I> bespeaks, 1. The high value that ought to be put upon Christ. The price was given, not for him; no, when it was given for him, it was soon brought back again with disdain, as infinitely below his worth; he cannot be <I>valued with the gold of Ophir,</I> nor this unspeakable Gift <I>brought with money.</I> 2. The low value that was put upon him. <I>They of the children of Israel</I> did strangely undervalue him, when his price did but reach to buy a potter&#146;s field, a pitiful sorry spot of ground, not worth looking upon. It added to the reproach of his being bought and sold, that it was at so low a rate. <I>Cast it to the potter,</I> so it is in Zechariah; a contemptible petty chapman, not the merchant that deals in things of value. And observe, <I>They of the children of Israel</I> thus <I>undervalued him;</I> they who were his own people, that should have known better what estimate to put upon him, they to whom he was first sent, whose glory he was, and whom he had valued so highly, and bought so dear. He gave kings&#146; ransoms for them, and the richest countries (so <I>precious were </I> <I>they in his sight,</I> <a href="/isaiah/43-3.html">Isa.&nbsp;43:3</a>, <a href="/isaiah/43-4.html">Isa.&nbsp;43:4</a> ), Egypt, and Ethiopia, and Seba; but they gave a slave&#146;s ransom for him (see <a href="/exodus/21-32.html">Ex.&nbsp;21:32</a> ), and valued him but at the rate of a potter&#146;s field; so was that blood trodden under foot, which bought the kingdom of heaven for us. But all this was <I>as the Lord </I> <I>appointed;</I> so the prophetic vision was, which typified this event, and so the event itself, as the other instances of Christ&#146;s sufferings, was <I>by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of </I> <I>God.</I> </p><p><a name="Mt27_11"></a><a name="Mt27_12"></a><a name="Mt27_13"></a><a name="Mt27_14"></a><a name="Mt27_15"></a><a name="Mt27_16"></a><a name="Mt27_17"></a><a name="Mt27_18"></a><a name="Mt27_19"></a><a name="Mt27_20"></a><a name="Mt27_21"></a><a name="Mt27_22"></a><a name="Mt27_23"></a><a name="Mt27_24"></a><a name="Mt27_25"></a> <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Matthew+27:11-25">Verses 11-25</a> We have here an account of what passed in Pilate&#146;s judgment-hall, when the blessed Jesus was brought thither betimes in the morning. Though it was no court-day, Pilate immediately took his case before him. We have there,I. The trial Christ had before Pilate.1. His arraignment; <I>Jesus stood before the governor,</I> as the prisoner before the judge. We could not stand before God because of our sins, nor lift up our face in his presence, if Christ had not been thus made sin for us. He was arraigned that we might be discharged. Some think that this bespeaks his courage and boldness; he stood <I>undaunted,</I> unmoved by all their rage. He thus stood in this judgment, that we might stand in God&#146;s judgment. He stood for a <I>spectacle,</I> as Naboth, when he was arraigned, was <I>set on high among the people.</I> 2. His indictment; <I>Art thou the king of the Jews?</I> The Jews were now not only under the government, but under the very jealous inspection, of the Roman powers, which they were themselves to the highest degree disaffected to, and yet now pretended a concern for, to serve this turn; accusing Jesus as an Enemy to Caesar (<a href="/luke/23-2.html">Lu.&nbsp;23:2</a> ), which they could produce no other proof of, than that he himself had newly owned he was <I>the Christ.</I> Now they thought that whoever was the Christ, must be the <I>king of the Jews,</I> and must deliver them from the Roman power, and restore to them a temporal dominion, and enable them to trample upon all their neighbours. According to this chimera of their own, they accused our Lord Jesus, as making himself king of the Jews, in opposition to the Roman yoke; whereas, though he said that he was the Christ, he meant not such a Christ as this. Note, Many oppose Christ&#146;s holy religion, upon a mistake of the nature of it; they dress it up in false colours, and then fight against it. They assuring the governor that, if he made himself Christ, he made himself king of the Jews, the governor takes it for granted, that he goes about to pervert the nation, and subvert the government. <I>Art thou a king?</I> It was plain that he was not so <I>de facto&#151;actually;</I> &quot;But dost thou lay any claim to the government, or pretend a right to rule the Jews?&#146;&#146; Note, It has often been the hard fate of Christ&#146;s holy religion, unjustly to fall under the suspicions of the civil powers, as if it were hurtful to kings and provinces, whereas it tends mightily to the benefit of both.3. His plea; <I>Jesus said unto him, &quot;Thou sayest.</I> It is as thou sayest, though not as thou meanest; I am a king, but not such a king as thou dost suspect me to be.&#146;&#146; Thus before Pilate he witnessed a good confession, and was not ashamed to own himself a king, though it looked ridiculous, nor afraid, though at this time it was dangerous.4. The evidence (<a href="/matthew/27-12.html">v.&nbsp;12</a>); He was <I>accused of the chief priests.</I> Pilate found <I>no fault in him;</I> whatever was said, nothing was proved, and therefore what was wanting in matter they made up in noise and violence, and followed him with repeated accusations, the same as they had given in before; but by the repetition they thought to force a belief from the governor. They had learned, not only <I>calumniari&#151;to calumniate,</I> but <I>fortiter calumniari&#151;to calumniate stoutly.</I> The best men have often been accused of the worst crimes.5. The prisoner&#146;s silence as to the prosecutors&#146; accusations; <I>He answered nothing,</I> (1.) Because there was no occasion; nothing was alleged but what carried its own confutation along with it. (2.) He was now taken up with the great concern that lay between him and his Father, to whom he was offering up himself a Sacrifice, to answer the demands of his justice, which he was so intent upon, that he minded not what they said against him. (3.) His hour was come, and he submitted to his Father&#146;s will; <I>Not as I will, but as thou wilt.</I> He knew what his Father&#146;s will was, and therefore silently <I>committed himself to him that judgeth righteously. We</I> must not thus by our silence throw away our lives, because we are not lords of our lives, as Christ was of his; nor can we know, as he did, when our hour is come. But hence we must learn, <I>not to render </I> <I>railing for railing,</I> <a href="/1-peter/2-23.html">1 Pt.&nbsp;2:23</a> .Now, [1.] Pilate pressed him to make some reply (<a href="/matthew/27-13.html">v.&nbsp;13</a>); <I>Hearest thou not how many </I> <I>things they witness against thee?</I> What these things were, may be gathered from <a href="/luke/23-3.html">Lu.&nbsp;23:3</a>, <a href="/luke/23-5.html">Lu.&nbsp;23:5</a> ,  and <a href="/john/19-7.html">Jn.&nbsp;19:7</a> . Pilate, having no malice at all against him, was desirous he should clear himself, urges him to it, and believes he could do it; <I>Hearest thou not?</I> Yes, he did hear; and still he hears all that is witnessed unjustly against his truths and ways; but he keeps silence, because it is the day of his patience, and doth not answer, as he will shortly, <a href="/psalms/50-3.html">Ps.&nbsp;50:3</a> . [2.] He wondered at his silence; which was not interpreted so much into a contempt of the court, as a contempt of himself. And therefore Pilate is not said to be angry at it, but to have <I>marvelled greatly</I> at it, as a thing very unusual. He believed him to be innocent, and had heard perhaps that <I>never man </I> <I>spake like him;</I> and therefore he thought it strange that he had not one word to say for himself. We have,II. The outrage and violence of the people, in pressing the governor to crucify Christ. The chief priests had a great interest in the people, they called them <I>Rabbi, Rabbi,</I> made idols of them, and oracles of all they said; and they made use of this to incense them against him, and by the power of the mob gained the point which they could not otherwise carry. Now here are two instances of their outrage.1. Their preferring Barabbas before him, and choosing to have him released rather than Jesus.(1.) It seems it was grown into a custom with the Roman governors, for the honouring of the Jews, to grace the feast of the passover with the release of a prisoner, <a href="/matthew/27-15.html">v.&nbsp;15</a>. This, they thought, did honour to the feast, and was agreeable to the commemoration of their deliverance; but it was an invention of their own, and no divine institution; though some think that it was ancient, and kept up by the Jewish princes, before they became a province of the empire. However, it was a bad custom, an obstruction to justice, and an encouragement to wickedness. But our gospel-passover is celebrated with the release of prisoners, by him who hath <I>power on earth to </I> <I>forgive sins.</I> (2.) The prisoner put in competition with our Lord Jesus was Barabbas; he is here called a <I>notable</I> prisoner (<a href="/matthew/27-16.html">v.&nbsp;16</a>); either because by birth and breeding he was of some note and quality, or because he had signalized himself by something remarkable in his crimes; whether he was so <I>notable</I> as to recommend himself the more to the favours of the people, and so the more likely to be interceded for, or whether so <I>notable</I> as to make himself more liable to their age, is uncertain. Some think the latter, and therefore Pilate mentioned him, as taking it for granted that they would have desired any one&#146;s release rather than his. <I>Treason, murder,</I> and <I>felony,</I> are the three most enormous crimes that are usually punished by the sword of justice; and Barabbas was guilty of all three, <a href="/luke/23-19.html">Lu.&nbsp;23:19</a> ; <a href="/john/18-40.html">Jn.&nbsp;18:40</a> . A <I>notable prisoner</I> indeed, whose crimes were so complicated.(3.) The proposal was made by Pilate the governor (<a href="/matthew/27-17.html">v.&nbsp;17</a>); <I>Whom will ye that I release </I> <I>unto you?</I> It is probable that the judge had the nomination of two, one of which the people were to <I>choose.</I> Pilate proposed to them to have Jesus <I>released;</I> he was convinced of his innocency, and that the prosecution was malicious; yet had not the courage to acquit him, as he ought to have done, by his own power, but would have him released by the people&#146;s election, and so he hoped to satisfy both his own <I>conscience,</I> and the <I>people</I> too; whereas, finding no fault in him, he ought not to have <I>put him upon the country,</I> or brought him <I>into peril of his life.</I> But such little tricks and artifices as these, to trim the matter, and to keep in with conscience and the world too, are the common practice of those that seek more to please men than God. <I>What </I> <I>shall I do then,</I> saith Pilate, <I>with Jesus, who is called Christ?</I> He puts the people in mind of this, that this <I>Jesus,</I> whose release he proposed, was looked upon by some among them as the Messiah, and had given pregnant proofs of his being so; &quot;Do not <I>reject</I> one of whom your nation has professed such an expectation.&#146;&#146;The reason why Pilate <I>laboured</I> thus to get Jesus <I>discharged</I> was because he knew that <I>for </I> <I>envy the chief priests had delivered him up</I> (<a href="/matthew/27-18.html">v.&nbsp;18</a>); that it was not his <I>guilt,</I> but his goodness, that they were provoked at; and for this reason he <I>hoped</I> to bring him off by the people&#146;s act, and that they would be for his release. When David was <I>envied</I> by Saul, he was the <I>darling of </I> <I>the people;</I> and any one that heard the <I>hosannas</I> with which Christ was but a few days ago brought into Jerusalem, would have thought that he had been so, and that Pilate might safely have referred this matter to the commonalty, especially when so notorious a rogue was set up as a rival with him for their favours. But it proved otherwise.(4.) While Pilate was thus labouring the matter, he was confirmed in his unwillingness to condemn Jesus, by a message sent him from his wife (<a href="/matthew/27-19.html">v.&nbsp;19</a>), by way of caution; <I>Have thou </I> <I>nothing to do with that just man</I> (together with the reason), <I>for I have suffered many things this </I> <I>day in a cream because of him.</I> Probably, this message was delivered to Pilate publicly, in the hearing of all that were present, for it was intended to be a warning not to him only, but to the prosecutors. Observe,[1.] The special providence of God, in sending this dream to Pilate&#146;s wife; it is not likely that she had heard any thing, before, concerning Christ, at least not so as to occasion her dreaming of him, but it was immediately from God: perhaps she was one of the <I>devout and honourable </I> <I>women,</I> and had some sense of religion; yet God revealed himself by dreams to some that had not, as to Nebuchadnezzar. She <I>suffered many things</I> in this dream; whether she dreamed of the cruel usage of an innocent person, or of the judgments that would fall upon those that had any hand in his death, or both, it seems that it was a frightful dream, and her thoughts <I>troubled her,</I> as <a href="/daniel/2-1.html">Dan.&nbsp;2:1</a> <a href="/daniel/4-5.html">Dan.&nbsp;4:5</a> . Note, The Father of spirits has many ways of access to the spirits of men, and can <I>seal their instruction in a dream, or vision of the night,</I> <a href="/job/33-15.html">Job.&nbsp;33:15</a>, <a href="/job/33-16.html">Job.&nbsp;33:16</a> . Yet to those who have the written word, God more ordinarily speaks by conscience on a waking bed, than by dreams, when <I>deep sleep falls upon men.</I> [2.] The tenderness and care of Pilate&#146;s wife, in sending this caution, thereupon, to her husband; <I>Have nothing to do with that just man. First,</I> This was an honourable testimony to our Lord Jesus, witnessing for him that he was a <I>just man,</I> even then when he was persecuted as the worst of malefactors: when his friends were afraid to appear in defence of him, God made even those that were strangers and enemies, to speak in his favour; when Peter denied him, Judas confessed him; when the chief priests pronounced him guilty of death, Pilate declared he <I>found </I> <I>no fault</I> in him; when the women that loved him stood afar off, Pilate&#146;s wife, who knew little of him, showed a concern for him. Note, God will not leave himself without witnesses to the truth and equity of his cause, even when it seems to be most spitefully run down by its enemies, and most shamefully deserted by its friends. <I>Secondly,</I> It was a fair warning to Pilate; <I>Have nothing </I> <I>to do with him.</I> Note, God has many ways of giving checks to sinners in their sinful pursuits, and it is a great mercy to have such checks from Providence, from faithful friends, and from our own consciences; it is also our great duty to hearken to them. <I>O do not this abominable thing </I> <I>which the Lord hates,</I> is what we may hear said to us, when we are entering into temptation, if we will but regard it. Pilate&#146;s lady sent him this warning, out of the love she had to him; she feared not a rebuke from him for meddling with that which belonged not to her; but, let him take it how he would, she would give him the caution. Note, It is an instance of true love to our friends and relations, to do what we can to keep them from sin; and the nearer any are to us, and the greater affection we have for them, the more solicitous we should be not to suffer sin to come or lie upon them, <a href="/leviticus/19-17.html">Lev.&nbsp;19:17</a> . The best friendship is friendship to the soul. We are not told how Pilate turned this off, probably with a jest; but by his proceeding against the just man it appears that he did not regard it. Thus faithful admonitions are made light of, when they are given as warnings against sin, but will not be so easily made light of, when they shall be reflected upon as aggravations of sin.(5.) The chief priests and the elders were busy, all this while, to influence the people in favour of Barabbas, <a href="/matthew/27-20.html">v.&nbsp;20</a>. They <I>persuaded the multitude,</I> both by themselves and their emissaries, whom they sent abroad among them, <I>that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy </I> <I>Jesus;</I> suggesting that this Jesus was a deceiver, in league with Satan, an enemy to their church and temple; that, if he were let alone, the Romans would come, and take away their place and nation; that Barabbas, though a bad man, yet, having not the interest that Jesus had, could not do so much mischief. Thus they managed the mob, who otherwise were well affected to Jesus, and, if they had not been so much at the beck of their priests, would never have done such a preposterous thing as to prefer Barabbas before Jesus. Here, [1.] We cannot but look upon these wicked priests with indignation; by the law, in <I>matters of controversy between blood and </I> <I>blood,</I> the people were to be guided by the priests, and to do as they informed them, <a href="/deuteronomy/17-8.html">Deu.&nbsp;17:8</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/17-9.html">Deu.&nbsp;17:9</a> . This great power put into their hands they wretchedly abused, and the leaders of the people caused them to err. [2.] We cannot but look upon the deluded people with pity; <I>I have </I> <I>compassion on the multitude,</I> to see them hurried thus violently to so great wickedness, to see them thus priest-ridden, and falling in the ditch with their <I>blind leaders.</I> (6.) Being thus over-ruled by the priests, at length they made their choice, <a href="/matthew/27-21.html">v.&nbsp;21</a>. <I>Whether of </I> <I>the twain</I> (saith Pilate) <I>will ye that I release unto you?</I> He hoped that he had gained his point, to have Jesus released. But, to his great surprise, they said <I>Barabbas;</I> as if his <I>crimes</I> were <I>less,</I> and therefore he less <I>deserved to die;</I> or as if his <I>merits</I> were <I>greater,</I> and therefore he better <I>deserved to live.</I> The cry for Barabbas was so universal, one and all, that there was no colour to demand a poll between the candidates. <I>Be astonished, O heavens, at this, and, thou earth, </I> <I>be horribly afraid!</I> Were ever men that pretended to reason or religion, guilty of such prodigious madness, such horrid wickedness! This was it that Peter charged so home upon them (<a href="/acts/3-14.html">Acts.&nbsp;3:14</a> ); <I>Ye desired a murderer to be granted to you;</I> yet multitudes who choose the world, rather than God, for their ruler and portion, thus <I>choose their own delusions.</I> 2. Their pressing earnestly to have Jesus crucified, <a href="/matthew/27-22.html">v.&nbsp;22</a>, <a href="/matthew/27-23.html">v.&nbsp;23</a>. Pilate, being amazed at their choice of Barabbas, was willing to hope that it was rather from a fondness for him than from an enmity to Jesus; and therefore he puts it to them, <I>&quot;What shall I do then with Jesus?</I> Shall I release him likewise, for the greater honour of your feast, or will you leave it to me?&#146;&#146; No, <I>they </I> <I>all said, Let him be crucified.</I> That death they desired he might die, because it was looked upon as the most scandalous and ignominious; and they hoped thereby to make his followers ashamed to own him, and their relation to him. It was absurd for them to prescribe to the judge what sentence he should pass; but their malice and rage made them forget all rules of order and decency, and turned a court of justice into a <I>riotous, tumultuous,</I> and <I>seditious assembly.</I> Now was truth fallen in the street, and equity could not enter; where one <I>looked for judgment, </I> <I>behold, oppression,</I> the worst kind of oppression; for righteousness, behold, a cry, the worse cry that ever was, <I>Crucify, crucify</I> the Lord of glory. Though they that cried thus, perhaps, were not the same persons that the other day cried <I>Hosanna,</I> yet see what a change was made upon the mind of the populace in a little time: when he <I>rode in triumph</I> into Jerusalem, so <I>general</I> were the <I>acclamations of praise,</I> that one would have thought he had <I>no enemies;</I> but now when he was <I>led in triumph</I> to Pilate&#146;s judgment-seat, so <I>general</I> were the <I>outcries</I> of enmity, that one would think he had <I>no friends.</I> Such revolutions are there in this changeable world, through which our way to heaven lies, as our Master&#146;s did, <I>by honour and dishonour, by evil report, and </I> <I>good report,</I> counter-changed (<a href="/2-corinthians/6-8.html">2 Co.&nbsp;6:8</a> ); that we may not be lifted up by honour, as if, when we were applauded and caressed, we had <I>made our nest among the stars,</I> and should <I>die in </I> <I>that nest;</I> nor yet be dejected or discouraged by dishonour, as if, when we were trodden to the lowest hell, from which there is <I>no redemption. Bides tu istos qui te laudant; omnes aut sunt </I> <I>hostes, aut (quod in aequo est) esse possunt&#151;You observe those who applaud you; either they </I> <I>are all your enemies, or, which is equivalent, they may become so.</I> Seneca de Vita Beat.Now, as to this demand, we are further told,(1.) How Pilate objected against it; <I>Why, what evil hath he done?</I> A proper question to ask before we censure any in common discourse, much more for a judge to ask before he pass a sentence of death. Note, It is much for the honour of the Lord Jesus, that, though he suffered as an evil-doer, yet neither his judge nor his prosecutors could find that he had done any evil. Had he done any evil <I>against God?</I> No, he <I>always did those things that pleased him.</I> Had he done any evil against the <I>civil government?</I> No, as he did himself, so he taught others, to <I>render to </I> <I>Caesar the things that were Caesar&#146;s.</I> Had he done any evil against the <I>public peace?</I> No, he did not <I>strive or cry,</I> nor did his kingdom <I>come with observation.</I> Had he done any evil to particular persons? <I>Whose ox had he taken, or whom had he defrauded?</I> No, so far from that, that he <I>went about doing good.</I> This repeated assertion of his unspotted innocency, plainly intimates that he died to satisfy for the sins of others; for if it had not been for our transgressions that he was thus wounded, and for our offences that he was delivered up, and that upon his own voluntary undertaking to atone for them, I see not how these extraordinary sufferings of a person that had never thought, said, or done, any thing amiss, could be reconciled with the justice and equity of that providence that governs the world, and at least <I>permitted</I> this to be done in it.(2.) How they <I>insisted</I> upon it; <I>They cried out the more, Let him be crucified.</I> They do not go about to show any evil he had done, but, right or wrong, he must be <I>crucified.</I> Quitting all pretensions to the proof of the premises, they resolve to hold the conclusion, and what was wanting in evidence to make up in clamour; this unjust judge was wearied by importunity into an unjust sentence, as he in the parable into a just one (<a href="/luke/18-4.html">Lu.&nbsp;18:4</a>, <a href="/luke/18-5.html">Lu.&nbsp;18:5</a> ), and the cause carried purely by noise.III. Here is the <I>devolving</I> of the <I>guilt</I> of Christ&#146;s blood upon the <I>people</I> and <I>priests.</I> 1. Pilate endeavours to transfer it from himself, <a href="/matthew/27-24.html">v.&nbsp;24</a>.(1.) He sees it <I>to no purpose to contend.</I> What he said, [1.] Would do no good; <I>he could </I> <I>prevail nothing;</I> he could not convince them what an unjust unreasonable thing it was for him to condemn a man whom he believed innocent, and whom they could not prove guilty. See how strong the stream of lust and rage sometimes is; neither authority nor reason will prevail to give check to it. Nay, [2.] It was more likely to <I>do hurt;</I> he saw that rather a <I>tumult was made.</I> This rude and brutish people fell to high words, and began to threaten Pilate what they would do if he did not gratify them; and how great a matter might this fire kindle, especially when the priests, those great incendiaries, blew the coals! Now this turbulent tumultuous temper of the Jews, by which Pilate was awed to condemn Christ against his conscience, contributed more than any thing to the ruin of that nation not long after; for their frequent insurrections provoked the Romans to destroy them, though they had reduced them, and their inveterate quarrels among themselves made them an easy prey to the common enemy. Thus their sin was their ruin.Observe how easily we may be mistaken in the inclination of the common people; the priests were apprehensive that their endeavours to <I>seize</I> Christ would have caused an uproar, especially <I>on the feast day;</I> but it proved that Pilate&#146;s endeavour to <I>save</I> him, caused an uproar, and that on the feast day; so uncertain are the sentiments of the crowd.(2.) This puts him into a <I>great strait,</I> betwixt the peace of his own mind, and the peace of the city; he is loth to condemn an innocent man, and yet loth to <I>disoblige</I> the people, and raise a devil that would not be soon laid. Had he steadily and resolutely adhered to the sacred laws of justice, as a judge ought to do, he had not been in any perplexity; the matter was plain and past dispute, that a man in whom was found <I>no faulty,</I> ought not to be crucified, upon any pretence whatsoever, nor must an unjust thing be done, to gratify any man or company of men in the world; the cause is soon decided; <I>Let justice be done, though heaven and earth come </I> <I>together&#151;Fiat justitia, ruat coelum.</I> If <I>wickedness proceed from the wicked,</I> though they be priests, yet <I>my hand shall not be upon him.</I> (3.) Pilate thinks to trim the matter, and to pacify both the people and his own conscience too, by <I>doing it,</I> and yet <I>disowning</I> it, <I>acting</I> the thing, and yet <I>acquitting</I> himself from it at the same time. Such absurdities and self-contradictions do <I>they</I> run upon, whose convictions are <I>strong,</I> but their corruptions <I>stronger. Happy is he</I> (saith the apostle, <a href="/romans/14-22.html">Rom.&nbsp;14:22</a> ) <I>that </I> <I>condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth;</I> or, which is all one, that <I>allows</I> not himself in that thing which he <I>condemns.</I> Now Pilate endeavours to clear himself from the guilt,[1.] By a <I>sign;</I> He <I>took water, and washed his hands before the multitude;</I> not as if he thought thereby to cleanse himself from any guilt contracted before God, but to acquit himself before the people, from so much as contracting any guilt in this matter; as if he had said, &quot;If it be done, bear witness that it is none of my doing.&#146;&#146; He <I>borrowed</I> the ceremony from that law which appointed it to be used for the clearing of the country from the guilt of an undiscovered murder (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-6.html">Deu.&nbsp;21:6</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/21-7.html">Deu.&nbsp;21:7</a> ); and he used it the more to affect the people with the conviction he was under of the prisoner&#146;s innocency; and, probably, such was the noise of the rabble, that, if he had not used some such surprising sign, in the view of them all, he could not have been heard.[2.] By a <I>saying;</I> in which, <I>First,</I> He <I>clears</I> himself; <I>I am innocent of the blood of this just </I> <I>person.</I> What nonsense was this, to condemn him, and yet protest that he was innocent of his blood! For men to protest against a thing, and yet to practise it, is only to proclaim that they sin against their consciences. Though Pilate professed his innocency, God charges him with guilt, <a href="/acts/4-27.html">Acts.&nbsp;4:27</a> . Some think to justify themselves, by pleading that their <I>hands</I> were not in the sin; but David kills by the sword of the children of Ammon, and Ahab by the elders of Jezreel. Pilate here thinks to justify himself, by pleading that his <I>heart</I> was not in the action; but this is an averment which will never be admitted. <I>Protestatio non valet contra factum&#151;In vain does he </I> <I>protest against the deed which at the same time he perpetrates. Secondly,</I> He casts it upon the priests and people; <I>&quot;See ye to it;</I> if it must be done, I cannot help it, do you answer it before God and the world.&#146;&#146; Note, Sin is a brat that nobody is willing to own; and many deceive themselves with this, that they shall bear no blame if they can but find any to lay the blame upon; but it is not so easy a thing to transfer the guilt of sin as many think it is. The condition of him that is infected with the plague is not the less dangerous, either for his catching the infection from others, or his communicating the infection to others; we may be <I>tempted</I> to sin, but cannot be <I>forced.</I> The priests threw it upon Judas; <I>See thou to it;</I> and now Pilate throws it upon them; <I>See ye to it; for with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you.</I> 2. The priests and people<I> consented</I> to take the guilt <I>upon themselves;</I> they all said, <I>&quot;His </I> <I>blood be on us, and one our children;</I> we are so well assured that there is neither sin nor danger in putting him to death, that we are willing to run the hazard of it;&#146;&#146; as if the guilt would do no harm to them or theirs. They saw that it was the dread of guilt that made Pilate hesitate, and that he was getting over this difficulty by a fancy of transferring it; to prevent the return of his hesitation, and to confirm him in that fancy, they, in the heat of their rage, agreed to it, rather than lose the prey they had in their hands, and cried, <I>His blood be upon us.</I> Now,(1.) By this they designed to indemnify Pilate, that is, to make him think himself indemnified, by becoming bound to divine justice, to save him harmless. But those that are themselves bankrupts and beggars will never be admitted security for others, nor taken as a bail for them. None could bear the sin of others, except him that had none of his own to answer for; it is a bold undertaking, and too big for any creature, to become bound for a sinner to Almighty God.(2.) But they did really imprecate wrath and vengeance upon themselves and their posterity. What a desperate word was this, and how little did they think what as the direful import of it, or to what an abyss of misery it would bring them and theirs! Christ had lately told them, that upon them would come <I>all the righteous blood shed upon the earth,</I> from that of the righteous Abel; but as if that were too little, they here imprecate upon themselves the guilt of that blood which was more precious than all the rest, and the guilt of which would lie heavier. O the daring presumption of wilful sinners, that <I>run upon God, upon his neck,</I> and defy his justice! <a href="/job/15-25.html">Job.&nbsp;15:25</a>, <a href="/job/15-26.html">Job.&nbsp;15:26</a> . Observe,[1.] How <I>cruel</I> they were in their <I>imprecation.</I> They imprecated the punishment of this sin, not only upon themselves, but upon <I>their children</I> too, even those that were yet unborn, without so much as limiting the entail of the curse, as God himself had been pleased to limit it, to the <I>third and fourth generation.</I> It was madness to pull it upon themselves, but the height of barbarity to entail it on their posterity. Surely they were like the ostrich; they were <I>hardened </I> <I>against their young ones,</I> as though they were not <I>theirs.</I> What a dreadful conveyance was this of guilt and wrath to them and their heirs for ever, and this delivered by <I>joint consent, nemine </I> <I>contradicents&#151;unanimously,</I> as their own <I>act and deed;</I> which certainly amounted to a forfeiture and defeasance of that ancient charter, <I>I will be a God to thee, and to thy seed.</I> Their entailing the curse of the Messiah&#146;s blood upon their nation, cut off the entail of the blessings of that blood from <I>their</I> families, that, according to another promise made to Abraham, in him <I>all the </I> <I>families of the earth</I> might be blessed. See what enemies wicked men are to their own children and families; those that damn their own souls, care not how many they take to hell with them.[2.] How righteous God was, in his retribution according to this imprecation; they said, <I>His </I> <I>blood be on us, and on our children;</I> and God said <I>Amen</I> to it, so shall thy doom be; as they <I>loved cursing,</I> so it came upon them. The wretched remains of that abandoned people feel it to this day; from the time they imprecated this blood upon them, they were followed with one judgment after another, till they were quite laid waste, and made an astonishment, a hissing, and a byword; yet on some of them, and some of theirs, this blood came, not to <I>condemn</I> them, but to <I>save</I> them; divine mercy, upon their repenting and believing, cut off this entail, and then <I>the </I> <I>promise</I> was again <I>to them, and to their children.</I> God is better to us and ours than we are.</p><p><a name="Mt27_26"></a><a name="Mt27_27"></a><a name="Mt27_28"></a><a name="Mt27_29"></a><a name="Mt27_30"></a><a name="Mt27_31"></a><a name="Mt27_32"></a> <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Matthew+27:26-32">Verses 26-32</a> In these verses we have the <I>preparatives</I> for, and <I>prefaces</I> to, the crucifixion of our Lord Jesus. Here is,I. The sentence passed, and the warrant signed for his execution; and this <I>immediately,</I> the same hour.1. Barabbas was released, that notorious criminal: if he had not been put in competition with Christ for the favour of the people, it is probable that he had died for his crimes; but that proved the means of his escape; to intimate that Christ was condemned for this purpose, that sinners, even the chief of sinners, might be <I>released;</I> he was <I>delivered up,</I> that we might be delivered; whereas the <I>common instance</I> of divine Providence, is, that <I>the wicked is a ransom for the </I> <I>righteous, and the transgressor for the upright,</I> <a href="/proverbs/21-18.html">Prov.&nbsp;21:18</a> <a href="/proverbs/11-18.html">Prov.&nbsp;11:18</a> . In this <I>unparalleled instance</I> of divine grace, the <I>upright</I> is a <I>ransom for the transgressors,</I> the just for the unjust.2. Jesus was <I>scourged;</I> this was an ignominious cruel punishment, especially as is was inflicted by the Romans, who were not under the moderation of the Jewish law, which forbade scourgings, above forty stripes; this punishment was most unreasonably inflicted on one that was sentenced to die: the <I>rods</I> were not to introduce the axes, but to supersede them. Thus the scripture was fulfilled, <I>The ploughers ploughed upon my back</I> (<a href="/psalms/129-3.html">Ps.&nbsp;129:3</a> ), <I>I gave my back </I> <I>to the smiters</I> (<a href="/isaiah/50-6.html">Isa.&nbsp;50:6</a> ), and, <I>By his stripes we are healed,</I> <a href="/isaiah/53-5.html">Isa.&nbsp;53:5</a> . He was <I>chastised with </I> <I>whips,</I> that we might not be for ever <I>chastised with scorpions.</I> 3. He was then <I>delivered to be crucified;</I> though his chastisement was in order to our peace, yet there is no peace made but by the <I>blood of his cross</I> (<a href="/colossians/1-20.html">Col.&nbsp;1:20</a> ); therefore the scourging is not enough, he must be <I>crucified;</I> a kind of death used only among the Romans; the manner of it is such, that it seems to be the result of wit and cruelty in combination, each putting forth itself to the utmost, to make death in the highest degree terrible and miserable. A cross was set up in the ground, to which the hands and feet were nailed, on which nails the weight of the body hung, till it died of the pain. This was the death to which Christ was condemned, that he might answer the type of the brazen serpent lifted up upon a pole. It was a bloody death, a painful, shameful, cursed death; it was so miserable a death, that merciful princes appointed those who were condemned to it by the law, to be strangled first, and then nailed to the cross; so Julius Caesar did by some pirates, <I>Sueton. lib.</I> 1. Constantine, the first Christian emperor, by an edict abolished the use of that punishment among the Romans, <I>Sozomen, Hist. lib.</I> 1. ch. 8. <I>Ne </I> <I>salutare signum subserviret ad perniciem&#151;That the symbol of salvation might not be </I> <I>subservient to the victim&#146;s destruction.</I> II. The barbarous treatment which the soldiers gave him, while things were getting ready for his execution. When he was condemned, he ought to have had some time allowed him to prepare for death. There was a law made by the Roman senate, in Tiberius&#146;s time, perhaps upon complaint of this and the like precipitation, that the execution of criminals should be deferred at least <I>ten days</I> after sentence. <I>Sueton in Tiber. cap.</I> 25. But there were scarcely allowed so many minutes to our Lord Jesus; nor had he any breathing-time during those minutes; it was a <I>crisis,</I> and there were no <I>lucid intervals</I> allowed him; <I>deep called unto deep,</I> and the storm continued without any intermission.When he was <I>delivered</I> to be <I>crucified,</I> that was enough; they that <I>kill the body,</I> yield that there is no more that they <I>can do,</I> but Christ&#146;s enemies will <I>do more,</I> and, if it be possible, wrap up a thousand deaths in one. Though Pilate pronounced him innocent, yet his soldiers, his guards, set themselves to abuse him, being swayed more by the fury of the people <I>against him,</I> than by their master&#146;s testimony <I>for him;</I> the Jewish <I>rabble</I> infected the Roman soldiery, or perhaps it was not so much in spite to him, as to make <I>sport</I> for themselves, that they thus abused him. They understood that he <I>pretended to a crown; to taunt</I> him with that gave them some diversion, and an opportunity to make themselves and one another merry. Note, It is an argument of a base, servile, sordid spirit, to insult over those that are in misery, and to make the calamities of any matter of sport and merriment.Observe, 1. <I>Where</I> this was done&#151;in the <I>common hall.</I> The <I>governor&#146;s house,</I> which should have been a shelter to the wronged and abused, is made the theatre of this barbarity. I wonder that the governor, who was so desirous to acquit himself from the blood of this just person, would suffer this to be done in <I>his</I> house. Perhaps he did not order it to be done, but he <I>connived</I> at it; and those in authority will be accountable, not only for the wickedness which they <I>do,</I> or <I>appoint,</I> but for that which they do not restrain, when it is in the power of their hands. Masters of families should not suffer their houses to be places of abuse to any, nor their servants to make sport with the sins, or miseries, or religion, of others.2. <I>Who</I> were concerned in it. They gathered the <I>whole band,</I> the soldiers that were to attend the execution, would have the whole regiment (at least five hundred, some think twelve or thirteen hundred) to share in the diversion. If Christ was thus made a <I>spectacle,</I> let none of his followers think it strange to be so used, <a href="/1-corinthians/4-9.html">1 Co.&nbsp;4:9</a> ; <a href="/hebrews/10-33.html">Heb.&nbsp;10:33</a> .3. What particular indignities were done him.(1.) They <I>stripped him,</I> <a href="/matthew/27-28.html">v.&nbsp;28</a>. The shame of nakedness came in with sin (<a href="/genesis/3-7.html">Gen.&nbsp;3:7</a> ); and therefore Christ, when he came to satisfy for sin, and take it away, was <I>made naked,</I> and submitted to <I>that shame,</I> that he might prepare for us <I>white raiment, to cover us,</I> <a href="/revelation/3-18.html">Rev.&nbsp;3:18</a> .(2.) They <I>put on him a scarlet robe,</I> some old red cloak, such as the Roman soldiers wore, in imitation of the <I>scarlet robes</I> which kings and emperors wore; thus upbraiding him with his being called <I>a King.</I> This <I>sham</I> of majesty they put upon him in his dress, when nothing but meanness and misery appeared in his countenance, only to expose him to the spectators, as the more <I>ridiculous;</I> yet there was something of <I>mystery</I> in it; this was he that was <I>red in his apparel</I> (<a href="/isaiah/63-1.html">Isa.&nbsp;63:1</a>, <a href="/isaiah/63-2.html">Isa.&nbsp;63:2</a> ), that <I>washed his garments in wine</I> (<a href="/genesis/49-11.html">Gen.&nbsp;49:11</a> ); therefore he was dressed in a <I>scarlet robe.</I> Our sins were as <I>scarlet and crimson.</I> Christ being clad in a <I>scarlet robe,</I> signified his bearing our sins, to his shame, in his own body upon the tree; that we might wash our robes, and make them white, in the blood of the Lamb.(3.) They <I>platted a crown of thorns, and put it upon his head,</I> <a href="/matthew/27-29.html">v.&nbsp;29</a>. This was to carry on the humour of making him a <I>mock-king;</I> yet, had they intended it only for a <I>reproach,</I> they might have <I>platted a crown of straw,</I> or <I>rushes,</I> but they designed it to be painful to him, and to be <I>literally,</I> what crowns are said to be figuratively, lined with thorns; he that invented this abuse, it is likely, valued himself upon the wit of it; but there was a mystery in it. [1.] Thorns came in with sin, and were part of the curse that was the product of sin, <a href="/genesis/3-18.html">Gen.&nbsp;3:18</a> . Therefore Christ, being made a <I>curse for us,</I> and dying to remove the curse from us, felt the pain and smart of those thorns, nay, and <I>binds them as a crown</I> to him (<a href="/job/31-36.html">Job.&nbsp;31:36</a> ); for his sufferings for us were <I>his glory.</I> [2.] Now he answered to the type of Abraham&#146;s ram that was <I>caught in the thicket,</I> and so offered up instead of Isaac, <a href="/genesis/22-13.html">Gen.&nbsp;22:13</a> . [3.] Thorns signify afflictions, <a href="/2-chronicles/33-11.html">2 Chr.&nbsp;33:11</a> . These Christ put into a <I>crown;</I> so much did he alter the property of them to them that are his, giving them cause to <I>glory in tribulation,</I> and making it to work for them a weight of glory. [4.] Christ was crowned with thorns, to show that <I>his kingdom was not of this world,</I> nor the glory of it worldly glory, but is attended here with bonds and afflictions, while the glory of it is <I>to be </I> <I>revealed.</I> [5.] It was the custom of some heathen nations, to bring their sacrifices to the altars, crowned with garlands; these thorns were the garlands with which this great Sacrifice was crowned. [6.] these thorns, it is likely, fetched blood from his blessed head, which trickled down his face, <I>like the previous ointment</I> (typifying the blood of Christ with which he consecrated himself) <I>upon the head, which ran down upon the beard, even Aaron&#146;s beard,</I> <a href="/psalms/133-2.html">Ps.&nbsp;133:2</a> . Thus, when he came to espouse to himself his love, his dove, his undefiled church, his <I>head was filled </I> <I>with dew,</I> and his <I>locks with the drops of the night,</I> <a href="/song-of-solomon/5-2.html">Cant.&nbsp;5:2</a> .(4.) They <I>put a reed in his right hand;</I> this was intended for a <I>mock-sceptre,</I> another of the <I>insignia</I> of the majesty they jeered him with; as if this were a sceptre good enough for such a King, as was like <I>a reed shaken with the wind</I> <a href="/matthew/11-7.html">ch.&nbsp;11:7</a> ); like sceptre, like kingdom, both weak and wavering, and withering and worthless; but they were quite mistaken, for his throne is <I>for </I> <I>ever and ever,</I> and the <I>sceptre of his kingdom is a right sceptre,</I> <a href="/psalms/45-6.html">Ps.&nbsp;45:6</a> .(5.) <I>They bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!</I> Having made him a sham King, they thus make a jest of doing homage to him, thus ridiculing his pretensions to sovereignty, as Joseph&#146;s brethren (<a href="/genesis/37-8.html">Gen.&nbsp;37:8</a> ); <I>Shalt thou indeed reign over us?</I> But as they were afterward compelled to do obeisance to him, and enrich his dreams, so these here bowed the knee, in scorn to him who was, soon after this, exalted to the right hand of God, that <I>at his name every knee might bow,</I> or break before him; it is ill jesting with that which, sooner or later, will come in earnest.(6.) They <I>spit upon him;</I> thus he had been abused in the High Priest&#146;s hall, <a href="/matthew/26-67.html">ch.&nbsp;26:67</a> . In doing homage, the subject kissed the sovereign, in token of his allegiance; thus Samuel kissed Saul, and we are bid to <I>kiss the Son:</I> but they, in this mock-homage, instead of kissing him, spit in his face; that blessed face which outshines the sun, and before which the angels cover theirs, was thus polluted. It is strange that the sons of men should ever do such a piece of <I>villany,</I> and that the Son of God should ever <I>suffer</I> such a piece of <I>ignominy.</I> (7.) They <I>took the reed, and smote him on the head.</I> That which they had made the <I>mock-ensign</I> of his royalty, they now make the real instrument of <I>their</I> cruelty, and <I>his pain.</I> They smote him, it is probable, upon the <I>crown of thorns,</I> and so struck them into his head, that they might wound it the deeper, which made the more sport for them, to whom his pain was the greatest pleasure. Thus was he <I>despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and </I> <I>acquainted with grief.</I> All this misery and shame he underwent, that he might purchase for us everlasting life, and joy, and glory.III. The conveying of him to the place of execution. After they had mocked and abused him, as long as they thought fit, they then <I>took the robe off from him;</I> to signify their divesting him of all the kingly authority they had invested him with, by putting it on him; and they put his own raiment on him, because that was to fall to the soldiers&#146; share, that were employed in the execution. They took off the robe, but no mention is made of their taking off the <I>crown of </I> <I>thorns,</I> whence it is commonly supposed (though there is no certainty of it) that he was crucified with that on his head; for as he is a Priest upon his throne, so he was a King upon his cross. Christ was led to be crucified in <I>his own raiment,</I> because he himself was to <I>bear our sins </I> <I>in his own body upon the tree.</I> And here,1. They <I>led him away</I> to be <I>crucified;</I> he was led <I>as a lamb to the slaughter,</I> as a sacrifice to the altar. We may well imagine how they hurried him on, and dragged him along, with all the speed possible, lest any thing should intervene to prevent the glutting of their cruel rage with his precious blood. It is probable that they now loaded him with taunts and reproaches, and treated him as the off-scouring of all things. They led him away <I>out of the city;</I> for Christ, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, <I>suffered without the gate</I> (<a href="/hebrews/13-12.html">Heb.&nbsp;13:12</a> ), as if he that was the glory of them that <I>waited for redemption</I> in Jerusalem was not worthy to live among them. To this he himself had an eye, when in the parable he speaks of his being <I>cast out of the </I> <I>vineyard,</I> <a href="/matthew/21-39.html">ch.&nbsp;21:39</a> .2. They compelled Simon of Cyrene <I>to bear his cross,</I> <a href="/matthew/27-32.html">v.&nbsp;32</a>. It seems, at first he <I>carried the </I> <I>cross</I> himself, as Isaac carried the wood for the burnt-offering, which was to burn him. And this was intended, as other things, both for pain and shame to him. But after a while they <I>took the </I> <I>cross</I> off from him, either, (1.) In compassion to him, because they saw it was too great a load for him. We can hardly think that they had any consideration of that, yet it teaches us that God <I>considers the frame</I> of his people, and will not <I>suffer them to be tempted above what they are </I> <I>able;</I> he gives them some breathing-time, but they must expect that the cross will return, and the lucid intervals only give them space to prepare for the next fit. But, (2.) Perhaps it was because he could not, with the cross on his back, go forward so fast as they would have him. Or, (3.) They were afraid, lest he should faint away under the load of his cross, and die, and so prevent what their malice further intended to do against him: thus even the <I>tender mercies of the wicked</I> (which seem to be so) <I>are</I> really <I>cruel.</I> Taking the cross off from him, they <I>compelled</I> one Simon of Cyrene to bear it, pressing him to the service by the authority of the governor or the priests. It was a reproach, and none would do it but by compulsion. Some think that this Simon was a disciple of Christ, at least a well-wisher to him, and that they knew it, and therefore put this upon him. Note, All that will approve themselves disciples indeed, must follow Christ, <I>bearing his cross</I> <a href="/matthew/16-24.html">ch.&nbsp;16:24</a> ), <I>bearing his reproach,</I> <a href="/hebrews/13-13.html">Heb.&nbsp;13:13</a> . We must know the <I>fellowship of his sufferings for us,</I> and patiently submit to all the sufferings for him we are called out to; for those only shall <I>reign with him,</I> that <I>suffer with him;</I> shall sit with him in his kingdom, that drink of <I>his cup,</I> and are baptized with <I>his baptism.</I> </p></span><div class="Global-Page-Links"><a class="Previous" href="/commentaries/matthew-henry-complete/matthew/27.html">Prev</a><div class="GlobalPageLinksContainer"><ul><a name="PageLink-1" class="PageLink-1 active" href="/commentaries/matthew-henry-complete/matthew/27.html" >1</a><a name="PageLink-2" class="PageLink-2 " href="/commentaries/matthew-henry-complete/matthew/27.html?p=2" >2</a></ul>
