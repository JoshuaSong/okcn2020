		<span id="Page-1" style=""><b><a href="/john/11.html">Chapter&nbsp;11</a></b><P>In this chapter we have the history of that illustrious miracle which Christ wrought a little before his death&#151;the raising of Lazarus to life, which is recorded only by this evangelist; for the other three confine themselves to what Christ did in Galilee, where he resided most, and scarcely ever carried their history into Jerusalem till the passion-week: whereas John&#146;s memoirs relate chiefly to what passed at Jerusalem; this passage therefore was reserved for his pen. Some suggest that, when the other evangelists wrote, Lazarus was alive, and it would not well agree either with his safety or with his humility to have it recorded till now, when it is supposed he was dead. It is more largely recorded than any other of Christ&#146;s miracles, not only because there are many circumstances of it so very instructive and the miracle of itself so great a proof of Christ&#146;s mission, but because it was an earnest of that which was to be the crowning proof of all&#151;Christ&#146;s own resurrection. Here is, <I>I. The tidings sent to our Lord Jesus of the sickness of Lazarus, and his entertainment of those tidings (<a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=john+11:1-16">v.&nbsp;1-16</a>). II. The visit he made to Lazarus&#146;s relations when he had heard of his death, and their entertainment of the visit (<a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=john+11:17-32">v.&nbsp;17-32</a>). III. The miracle wrought in the raising of Lazarus from the dead (<a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=john+11:33-44">v.&nbsp;33-44</a>). IV. The effect wrought by this miracle upon others (<a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=john+11:45-57">v.&nbsp;45-57</a>).</I></p><p><a name="Joh11_1"></a><a name="Joh11_2"></a><a name="Joh11_3"></a><a name="Joh11_4"></a><a name="Joh11_5"></a><a name="Joh11_6"></a><a name="Joh11_7"></a><a name="Joh11_8"></a><a name="Joh11_9"></a><a name="Joh11_10"></a><a name="Joh11_11"></a><a name="Joh11_12"></a><a name="Joh11_13"></a><a name="Joh11_14"></a><a name="Joh11_15"></a><a name="Joh11_16"></a> <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=John+11:1-16">Verses 1-16</a> We have in these verses,I. A particular account of the parties principally concerned in this story, <a href="/john/11-1.html">v.&nbsp;1</a>, <a href="/john/11-2.html">v.&nbsp;2</a>. They lived at <I>Bethany,</I> a village nor far from Jerusalem, where Christ usually lodged when he came up to the feasts. It is here called the <I>town of Mary and Martha,</I> that is, the town where they dwelt, as Bethsaida is called the <I>city of Andrew and Peter,</I> <a href="/john/1-44.html">ch.&nbsp;1:44</a> . For I see no reason to think, as some do, that Martha and Mary were owners of the town, and the rest were <I>their</I> tenants. 2. Here was a brother named <I>Lazarus;</I> his <I>Hebrew</I> name probably was <I>Eleazar,</I> which being contracted, and a Greek termination put to it, is made <I>Lazarus.</I> Perhaps in prospect of this history our Saviour made use of the name of <I>Lazarus</I> in that parable wherein he designed to set forth the blessedness of the righteous in the bosom of Abraham immediately after death, <a href="/luke/16-22.html">Lu.&nbsp;16:22</a> . Here were two sisters, <I>Martha</I> and <I>Mary,</I> who seem to have been the housekeepers, and to have managed the affairs of the family, while perhaps Lazarus lived a retired life, and gave himself to study and contemplation. Here was a decent, happy, well-ordered family, and a family that Christ was very much conversant with, where yet there was neither husband nor wife (for aught that appears), but the house kept by a brother, and his sisters dwelling together in unity. 4. One of the sisters is particularly described to be <I>that Mary </I> <I>which anointed the Lord with ointment,</I> <a href="/john/11-2.html">v.&nbsp;2</a>. Some think she was that woman that we read of, <a href="/luke/7-37.html">Lu.&nbsp;7:37</a>, <a href="/luke/7-38.html">Lu.&nbsp;7:38</a> ,  who had been a <I>sinner,</I> a bad woman. I rather think it refers to that anointing of Christ which this evangelist relates <a href="/john/12-3.html">ch.&nbsp;12:3</a> ); for the evangelists do never refer one to another, but John frequently refers in one place of his gospel to another. Extraordinary acts of piety and devotion, that come from an honest principle of love to Christ, will not only find acceptance with him, but gain reputation in the church, <a href="/matthew/26-13.html">Mt.&nbsp;26:13</a> . This was she <I>whose brother Lazarus was </I> <I>sick;</I> and the sickness of those we love is our affliction. The more friends we have the more frequently we are thus afflicted by sympathy; and the dearer they are the more grievous it is. The multiplying of our comforts is but the multiplying of our cares and crosses.II. The tidings that were sent to our Lord Jesus of the sickness of Lazarus, <a href="/john/11-3.html">v.&nbsp;3</a>. <I>His sisters</I> knew where Jesus was, a great way off beyond Jordan, and they sent a special messenger to him, to acquaint him with the affliction of their family, in which they manifest, 1. The affection and concern they had for their brother. Though, it is likely, his estate would come to them after his death, yet they earnestly desired his life, as they ought to do. They showed their love to him now that he was sick, for a <I>brother is born for adversity,</I> and so is a sister too. We must weep with our friends when they weep, as well as rejoice with them when they rejoice. 2. The regard they had to the Lord Jesus, whom they were willing to make acquainted with all their concerns, and, like Jephthah, to utter all their words before him. Though God knows all our wants, and griefs, and cares, he will know them from us, and is honoured by our laying them before him. The message they sent was very short, not <I>petitioning,</I> much less <I>prescribing</I> or <I>pressing,</I> but barely relating the case with the tender insinuation of a powerful plea, <I>Lord, behold, he whom </I> <I>thou lovest is sick.</I> They do not say, He whom <I>we</I> love, but <I>he whom thou lovest.</I> Our greatest encouragements in prayer are fetched from God himself and from his grace. They do not say, Lord, behold, he <I>who loveth thee,</I> but <I>he whom thou lovest;</I> for <I>herein is love, not that we loved </I> <I>God, but that he loved us.</I> Our love to him is not worth speaking of, but his to us can never be enough spoken of. Note, (1.) There are some of the friends and followers of the Lord Jesus for whom he has a special kindness above others. Among the twelve there was one whom Jesus loved. (2.) It is no new thing for those whom Christ loves to be sick: all things come alike to all. Bodily distempers correct the corruption, and try the graces, of God&#146;s people. (3.) It is a great comfort to us, when we are sick, to have those about us that will pray for us. (4.) We have great encouragement in our prayers for those who are sick, if we have ground to hope that they are such as Christ loves; and we have reason to love and pray for those whom we have reason to think Christ loves and cares for.III. An account how Christ entertained the tidings brought him of the illness of his friend.1. He prognosticated the event and issue of the sickness, and probably sent it as a message to the sisters of Lazarus by the express, to support them while he delayed to come to them. Two things he prognosticates:&#151;(1.) <I>This sickness is not unto death.</I> It was mortal, proved <I>fatal,</I> and no doubt but Lazarus was truly dead for four days. But, [1.] That was not the errand upon which this sickness was sent; it came not, as in a common case, to be a summons to the grave, but there was a further intention in it. Had it been sent on that errand, his <I>rising from the dead would have defeated it.</I> [2.] That was not the final effect of this sickness. He <I>died,</I> and yet it might be said he did not <I>die,</I> for <I>factum non dicitur quod non perseverat&#151;That is not said to be done which is not done </I> <I>for a perpetuity.</I> Death is an everlasting farewell to this world; it is the way whence we shall not return; and in this sense it was <I>not unto death.</I> The grave was his <I>long home,</I> his <I>house of </I> <I>eternity.</I> Thus Christ said of the maid whom he proposed to restore to life, <I>She is not dead.</I> The sickness of good people, how threatening soever, is <I>nor unto death,</I> for it is not unto <I>eternal</I> death. The body&#146;s death to this world is the soul&#146;s birth into another world; when we or our friends are sick, we make it our principal support that there is hope of a recovery, but in that we may be disappointed; therefore it is our wisdom to build upon that in which we cannot be disappointed; if they belong to Christ, let the worst come to the worst, they cannot be <I>hurt of </I> <I>the second death,</I> and then not much hurt of the first.(2.) <I>But it is for the glory of God,</I> that an opportunity may be given for the manifesting of God&#146;s glorious power. The afflictions of the saints are designed for the glory of God, that he may have opportunity of showing them favour; for the sweetest mercies, and the most effecting, are those which are occasioned by trouble. Let this reconcile us to the darkest dispensations of Providence, they are all for the glory of God, this sickness, this loss, or this disappointment, is so; and, if God be glorified, we ought to be satisfied, <a href="/leviticus/10-3.html">Lev.&nbsp;10:3</a> . It was for the glory of God, for it was <I>that the Son of God might be glorified thereby,</I> as it gave him occasion to work that glorious miracle, the <I>raising of him from the dead.</I> As, before, the man was <I>born blind</I> that Christ might have the honour of curing him <a href="/john/9-3.html">ch.&nbsp;9:3</a> ), so Lazarus must be sick and die, that Christ may be glorified as the Lord of life. Let this comfort those whom Christ loves under all their grievances that the design of them all is that <I>the Son of God may be glorified thereby,</I> his wisdom, power, and goodness, glorified in supporting and relieving them; see <a href="/2-corinthians/12-9.html">2 Co.&nbsp;12:9</a>, <a href="/2-corinthians/12-10.html">2 Co.&nbsp;12:10</a> .2. He deferred visiting his patient, <a href="/john/11-5.html">v.&nbsp;5</a>, <a href="/john/11-6.html">v.&nbsp;6</a>. They had pleaded, <I>Lord, it is he whom thou </I> <I>lovest,</I> and the plea is allowed (<a href="/john/11-5.html">v.&nbsp;5</a>): <I>Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.</I> Thus the claims of faith are ratified in the court of heaven. Now one would think it should follow, <I>When </I> <I>he heard therefore that he was sick</I> he made all the haste that he could to him; if he loved them, now was a time to show it by hastening to them, for he knew they impatiently expected him. But he took the contrary way to show his love: it is not said, He loved them and <I>yet</I> he lingered; but he loved them and <I>therefore</I> he lingered; when he heard that his friend was sick, instead of coming post to him, he abode <I>two days still in the same place where he was.</I> (1.) He <I>loved </I> <I>them,</I> that is, had a great opinion of Martha and Mary, of their wisdom and grace, of their faith and patience, above others of his disciples, and therefore he deferred coming to them, that he might try them, that their trial might at last <I>be found to praise and honour.</I> (2.) He <I>loved them,</I> that is, he designed to do something great and extraordinary for them, to work such a miracle for their relief as he had not wrought for any of his friends; and therefore he delayed coming to them, that Lazarus might be <I>dead</I> and <I>buried</I> before he came. If Christ had come presently, and cured the sickness of Lazarus, he had done no more than he did for <I>many;</I> if he had raised him to life when newly dead, no more than he had done for <I>some:</I> but, deferring his relief so long, he had an opportunity of doing more for him than for <I>any.</I> Note, God hath gracious intentions even in seeming delays, <a href="/isaiah/54-7.html">Isa.&nbsp;54:7</a>, <a href="/isaiah/54-8.html">Isa.&nbsp;54:8</a> , <a href="/isaiah/49-14.html">Isa.&nbsp;49:14</a> ,  etc. Christ&#146;s friends at Bethany were not out of his thoughts, though, when he heard of their distress, he made no haste to them. When the work of deliverance, temporal or spiritual, public or personal, stands at a stay, it does but stay the time, and <I>every thing is beautiful in its season.</I> IV. The discourse he had with his disciples when he was about to visit his friends at Bethany, <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=john+11:7-16">v.&nbsp;7-16</a>. The conference is so very free and familiar as to make out what Christ saith, <I>I </I> <I>have called you friends.</I> Two things he discourses about&#151;his own <I>danger</I> and Lazarus&#146;s <I>death.</I> 1. His own danger in going into Judea, <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=john+11:7-10">v.&nbsp;7-10</a>.(1.) Here is the notice which Christ gave his disciples of his purpose to go into Judea towards Jerusalem. His disciples were the men of his counsel, and to them he saith (<a href="/john/11-7.html">v.&nbsp;7</a>), <I>&quot;Let </I> <I>us go into Judea again,</I> though those of Judea are unworthy of such a favour.&#146;&#146; Thus Christ repeats the tenders of his mercy to those who have often rejected them. Now this may be considered, [1.] As a purpose of his kindness to his friends at Bethany, whose affliction, and all the aggravating circumstances of it, he knew very well, though no more expresses were sent to him; for he was present in spirit, though absent in body. When he knew they were brought to the last extremity, when the brother and sisters had given and taken a final farewell, &quot;Now,&#146;&#146; saith he, &quot;let us go to Judea.&#146;&#146; Christ will arise in favour of his people when <I>the time to favour </I> <I>them, yea, the set time, is come;</I> and the worst time is commonly the set time&#151;when <I>our hope is </I> <I>lost, and we are cut off for our parts;</I> then they shall <I>know that I am the Lord</I> when <I>I have </I> <I>opened the graves,</I> <a href="/ezekiel/37-11.html">Eze.&nbsp;37:11</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/37-13.html">Eze.&nbsp;37:13</a> . In the depths of affliction, let this therefore keep us out of the depths of despair, that man&#146;s extremity is God&#146;s opportunity, <I>Jehovah-jireh.</I> Or, [2.] As a trial of the courage of the disciples, whether they would venture to follow him thither, where they had so lately been frightened by an attempt upon their Master&#146;s life, which they looked upon as an attempt upon theirs too. To go to Judea, which was so lately made <I>too hot</I> for them, was a saying that <I>proved them.</I> But Christ did not say, <I>&quot;Go you into Judea,</I> and I will stay and take shelter here;&#146;&#146; no, <I>Let us go.</I> Note, Christ never brings his people into any peril but he accompanies them in it, and is with them even when they <I>walk through the valley of the shadow </I> <I>of death.</I> (2.) Their objection against this journey (<a href="/john/11-8.html">v.&nbsp;8</a>): <I>Master, the Jews of late sought to stone thee, </I> <I>and goest thou thither again?</I> Here, [1.] They remind him of the danger he had been in there not long since. Christ&#146;s disciples are apt to make a greater matter of sufferings than their Master does, and to remember injuries longer. He had put up with the affront, it was over and gone, and forgotten, but his disciples could not forget it; <I>of late,</I> <I>nyn</I> &#151;<I>now,</I> as if it were this very day, they <I>sought to stone thee.</I> Though it was at least two months ago, the remembrance of the fright was fresh in their minds. [2.] They marvel that he will <I>go thither again.</I> &quot;Wilt thou favour those with thy presence that have expelled thee out of their coasts?&#146;&#146; Christ&#146;s ways in passing by offences are <I>above our ways.</I> &quot;Wilt thou expose thyself among a people that are so desperately enraged against thee? <I>Goest thou thither again,</I> where thou hast been so ill used?&#146;&#146; Here they showed great care for their Master&#146;s safety, as Peter did, when he said, <I>Master, spare thyself;</I> had Christ been inclined to shift off suffering, he did not want friends to persuade him to it, but he had <I>opened his mouth to the Lord,</I> and he would not, he could not, go back. Yet, while the disciples show a concern for his safety, they discover at the same time, <I>First,</I> A distrust of his power; as if he could not secure both himself and them now in Judea as well as he had done formerly. Is his arm shortened? When we are solicitous for the interests of Christ&#146;s church and kingdom in the world, we must yet rest satisfied in the wisdom and power of the Lord Jesus, who knows how to secure a flock of sheep in the midst of a herd of wolves. <I>Secondly,</I> A secret fear of suffering themselves; for they count upon this if he suffer. When our own private interests happen to run in the same channel with those of the public, we are apt to think ourselves zealous for the Lord of hosts, when really we are only zealous for our own wealth, credit, ease, and safety, and <I>seek our own things,</I> under colour of seeking the things of Christ; we have therefore need to distinguish upon our principles.(3.) Christ&#146;s answer to this objection (<a href="/john/11-9.html">v.&nbsp;9</a>, <a href="/john/11-10.html">v.&nbsp;10</a>): <I>Are there not twelve hours in the day?</I> The Jews divided every day into twelve hours, and made their hours longer or shorter according as the days were, so that an hour with them was the twelfth part of the time between sun and sun; so some. Or, lying much more south than we, their days were nearer twelve hours long than ours. The divine Providence has given us day-light to work by, and lengthens it out to a competent time; and, reckoning the year round, <I>every country</I> has just as much <I>daylight as night,</I> and so much more as the <I>twilights</I> amount to. Man&#146;s life is a <I>day;</I> this day is divided into divers ages, states, and opportunities, as into hours shorter or longer, as God has appointed; the consideration of this should make us not only <I>very busy,</I> as to the <I>work</I> of life (if there were <I>twelve hours in the day,</I> each of them ought to be filled up with duty, and none of <I>them</I> trifled away), but also <I>very easy</I> as to the perils of life; our day shall be lengthened out till our work be done, and our testimony finished. This Christ applies to his case, and shows why he must go to Judea, because he had a <I>clear call to go.</I> For the opening of this, [1.] He shows the comfort and satisfaction which a man has in his own mind while he keeps in the way of his duty, as it is in general prescribed by the word of God, and particularly determined by the providence of God: <I>If any man walk in the day, he stumbles not;</I> that is, If a man keep close to his duty, and mind that, and set the will of God before him as his rule, with an impartial respect to all God&#146;s commandments, he does not <I>hesitate</I> in his own mind, but, <I>walking uprightly, walks surely,</I> and with a holy confidence. As he that walks in the day stumbles not, but goes on steadily and cheerfully in his way, <I>because he sees the light of this world,</I> and by it sees his way before him; so a good man, without any collateral security or sinister aims, relies upon the word of God as his rule, and regards the glory of God as his end, <I>because he sees</I> those two great lights, and keeps his eye upon them; thus he is furnished with a faithful guide in all his doubts, and a powerful guard in all his dangers, <a href="/galatians/6-4.html">Gal.&nbsp;6:4</a> ; <a href="/psalms/119-6.html">Ps.&nbsp;119:6</a> . Christ, wherever he went, walked <I>in the </I> <I>day,</I> and so shall we, if we follow his steps. [2.] He shows the pain and peril a man is in who walks not according to this rule (<a href="/john/11-10.html">v.&nbsp;10</a>): <I>If a man walk in the night, he stumbles;</I> that is, If a man walk in the way of his heart, and the sight of his eyes, and according to the course of this world,&#151;if he consult his own carnal reasonings more than the will and glory of God,&#151;he falls into temptations and snares, is liable to great uneasiness and frightful apprehensions, trembles at the <I>shaking of a leaf,</I> and <I>flees</I> when none <I>pursues;</I> while an upright man <I>laughs at the shaking </I> <I>of the spear,</I> and stands undaunted when ten thousand invade. See <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=isaiah+33:14-16">Isa.&nbsp;33:14-16</a> ,  he stumbles, <I>because there is no light in him,</I> for light in us is that to our moral actions which light about us is to our natural actions. He has not a good principle within; he is not sincere; his eye is evil. Thus Christ not only justifies his purpose of going into Judea, but encourages his disciples to go along with him, and fear no evil.2. The death of Lazarus is here discoursed of between Christ and his disciples, <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=john+11:11-16">v.&nbsp;11-16</a>, where we have,(1.) The notice Christ gave his disciples of death of Lazarus, and an intimation that his business into Judea was to look after him, <a href="/john/11-11.html">v.&nbsp;11</a>. After he had prepared his disciples for this dangerous march into an enemy&#146;s country, he then gives them,[1.] Plain intelligence of the death of Lazarus, though he had received no advice of it: <I>Our </I> <I>friend Lazarus sleepeth.</I> See here how Christ calls a believer and a believer&#146;s death.<I>First,</I> He calls a believer his friend: <I>Our friend Lazarus.</I> Note, 1. There is a covenant of friendship between Christ and believers, and a friendly affection and communion pursuant to it, which our Lord Jesus will own and not be ashamed of. <I>His secret is with the righteous.</I> 2. Those whom Christ is pleased to own as his friends all his disciples should take for <I>theirs.</I> Christ speaks of Lazarus as their common friend: <I>Our friend.</I> 3. Death itself does not break the bond of friendship between Christ and a believer. Lazarus is dead, and yet he is still <I>our friend.</I> <I>Secondly,</I> He calls the death of a believer a <I>sleep: he sleepeth.</I> It is good to call death by such names and titles as will help to make it more <I>familiar</I> and less <I>formidable</I> to us. The death of Lazarus was in a peculiar sense a sleep, as that of Jairus&#146;s daughter, because he was to be raised again speedily; and, since we are sure to <I>rise again at last,</I> why should that make any great difference? And why should not the believing hope of that resurrection to eternal life make it as easy to us to put off the body and die as it is to put off our clothes and go to sleep? A good Christian, when he dies, does but sleep: he rests from the labours of the day past, and is refreshing himself for the next morning. Nay, herein death has the advantage of sleep, that sleep is only the <I>parenthesis,</I> but death is the <I>period,</I> of our cares and toils. The soul does not sleep, but becomes more active; but the body sleeps without any toss, without any terror; not distempered nor disturbed. The grave to the wicked is a prison, and its grave-clothes as the shackles of a criminal reserved for execution; but to the godly it is a bed, and all its bands as the soft and downy fetters of an easy quiet sleep. Though the body <I>corrupt,</I> it will rise in the morning as if it had never seen corruption; it is but putting off our clothes to be mended and trimmed up for the marriage day, the coronation day, to which we must rise. See <a href="/isaiah/57-2.html">Isa.&nbsp;57:2</a> ; <a href="/1-thessalonians/4-14.html">1 Th.&nbsp;4:14</a> . The Greeks called their burying-places <I>dormitories</I> &#151;<I>koimeteria</I> .[2.] Particular intimations of his favourable intentions concerning Lazarus: <I>but I go, that I </I> <I>may awake him out of sleep.</I> He could have done it, and yet have staid where he was: he that restored at a distance one that was <I>dying</I> <a href="/john/4-50.html">ch.&nbsp;4:50</a> ) could have raised at a distance one that was <I>dead;</I> but he would put this honour upon the miracle, to work it by the grave side: <I>I go, to </I> <I>awake him.</I> As sleep is a resemblance of death, so a man&#146;s awaking out of sleep when he is called, especially when he is called by his own name, is an emblem of the resurrection (<a href="/job/14-15.html">Job.&nbsp;14:15</a> ): <I>Then shalt thou call.</I> Christ had no sooner said, <I>Our friend sleeps,</I> but presently he adds, <I>I go, that I may awake him.</I> When Christ tells his people at any time how bad the case is he lets them know in the same breath how easily, how quickly, he can mend it. Christ&#146;s telling his disciples that this was his business to Judea might help to take off their fear of going with him thither; he did not go upon a public errand to the temple, but a private visit, which would not so much expose him and them; and, besides, it was to do a kindness to a family to which they were all obliged.(2.) Their mistake of the meaning of this notice, and the blunder they made about it (<a href="/john/11-12.html">v.&nbsp;12</a>, <a href="/john/11-13.html">v.&nbsp;13</a>): They said, <I>Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.</I> This intimates, [1.] <I>Some concern</I> they had for their friend Lazarus; they hoped he would recover; <I>sothesetai</I> &#151;<I>he shall be saved</I> from dying at this time. Probably they had understood, by the messenger who brought news of his illness, that one of the most threatening symptoms he was under was that he was restless, and could get no sleep; and now that they heard he slept they concluded the fever was going off, and the worst was past. Sleep is often nature&#146;s physic, and reviving to its weak and weary powers. This is true of the sleep of death; if a good Christian so <I>sleep,</I> he shall do well, better than he did here. [2.] A <I>greater concern</I> for themselves; for hereby they insinuate that it was now needless for Christ to go to him, and expose himself and them. &quot;If he sleep, he will be quickly well, and we may stay where we are.&#146;&#146; Thus we are willing to hope that the good work which we are called to do will do itself, or will be done by some other hand, if there be peril in the doing of it.(3.) This mistake of theirs rectified (<a href="/john/11-13.html">v.&nbsp;13</a>): <I>Jesus spoke of his death.</I> See here, [1.] How dull of understanding Christ&#146;s disciples as yet were. Let us not therefore condemn all those as heretics who mistake the sense of some of Christ&#146;s sayings. It is not good to aggravate our brethren&#146;s mistakes; yet this was a <I>gross</I> one, for it had easily been prevented if they had remembered how frequently death is called a sleep in the Old Testament. They should have understood Christ when he spoke scripture language. Besides, it would sound oddly for their Master to undertake a journey of two or three days only to awake a friend out of a natural sleep, which any one else might do. What Christ undertakes to do, we may be sure, is something great and uncommon, and a work <I>worthy of himself.</I> [2.] How carefully the evangelist corrects this error: <I>Jesus spoke of his death.</I> Those that speak in an unknown tongue, or use similitudes, should learn hence to <I>explain themselves,</I> and pray that they may interpret, to prevent mistakes.(4.) The plain and express declaration which Jesus made to them of the death of Lazarus, and his resolution to go to Bethany, <a href="/john/11-14.html">v.&nbsp;14</a>, <a href="/john/11-15.html">v.&nbsp;15</a>. [1.] He gives them notice of the death of Lazarus; what he had before said darkly he now says plainly, and without a figure: <I>Lazarus is </I> <I>dead,</I> <a href="/john/11-14.html">v.&nbsp;14</a>. Christ takes cognizance of the death of his saints, for it is precious in his sight (<a href="/psalms/116-15.html">Ps.&nbsp;116:15</a> ), and he is not pleased if we do not consider it, and lay it to heart. See what a compassionate teacher Christ is, and how he condescends to those that are out of the way, and by his subsequent sayings and doings explains the difficulties of what went before. [2.] He gives them the reason why he had delayed so long to go and see him: <I>I am glad for your sakes that I </I> <I>was not there.</I> If he had been there time enough, he would have healed his disease and prevented his death, which would have been much for the comfort of Lazarus&#146;s friends, but then his disciples would have seen no further proof of his power than what they had often seen, and, consequently, their faith had received no improvement; but now that he went and raised him from the dead, as there were many brought to <I>believe on him</I> who before did no (<a href="/john/11-45.html">v.&nbsp;45</a>), so there was much done towards the perfecting of what was lacking in the faith of those that did, which Christ aimed at: <I>To the intent that you may believe.</I> [3.] He resolves now to go to Bethany, and take his disciples along with him: <I>Let us go unto him.</I> Not, &quot;Let us go to his sisters, to comfort them&#146;&#146; (which is the utmost we can do), but, Let us go <I>to him;</I> for Christ can <I>show </I> <I>wonders to the dead.</I> Death, which will separate us from all our other friends, and cut us off from correspondence with them, cannot separate us from the love of Christ, nor put us out of the reach of his calls; as he will maintain his <I>covenant with the dust,</I> so he can make visits to the dust. <I>Lazarus is dead,</I> but <I>let us go to him;</I> though perhaps those who said, If he sleep there is <I>no need</I> to go, were ready to say, If he be dead it is to <I>no purpose</I> to go.(5.) Thomas exciting his fellow-disciples cheerfully to attend their Master&#146;s motions (<a href="/john/11-16.html">v.&nbsp;16</a>): <I>Thomas, who is called Didymus.</I> Thomas in Hebrew and Didymus in Greek signify a <I>twin;</I> it is said of Rebekah (<a href="/genesis/25-24.html">Gen.&nbsp;25:24</a> ) that there were <I>twins in her womb;</I> the word is <I>Thomim.</I> Probably Thomas was a <I>twin.</I> He said <I>to his fellow-disciples</I> (who probably looked with fear and concern upon one another when Christ had said so positively, <I>Let us go to him</I> ), very courageously, <I>Let us also go that we may die with him; with him,</I> that is,[1.] With Lazarus, who was now dead; so some take it. Lazarus was a dear and loving friend both to Christ and his disciples, and perhaps Thomas had a particular intimacy with him. Now if he be dead, saith he, <I>let us</I> even <I>go and die with him.</I> For, <I>First,</I> &quot;If we <I>survive,</I> we know not how to <I>live without him.&#146;&#146;</I> Probably Lazarus had done them many good offices, sheltered them, and provided for them, and been to them <I>instead of eyes;</I> and now that he was gone they had <I>no man like-minded,</I> and &quot;Therefore,&#146;&#146; saith he, &quot;we had as good die with him.&#146;&#146; Thus we are sometimes ready to think our lives bound up in the lives of some that were dear to us: but God will teach us to live, and to live comfortably, upon himself, when those are gone without whom we thought we could not live. But this is not all. <I>Secondly,</I> &quot;If we die, we hope to be <I>happy with him.&#146;&#146;</I> Such a firm belief he has of a happiness on the other side death, and such good hope through grace of their own and Lazarus&#146;s interest in it, that he is willing they should all go and <I>die with him.</I> It is better to die, and go along with our Christian friends to that world which is enriched by their removal to it, than stay behind in a world that is impoverished by their departure out of it. The more of our friends are translated hence, the fewer cords we have to bind us to this earth, and the more to draw our hearts heavenwards. How pleasantly does the good man speak of dying, as if it were but undressing and going to bed![2.] &quot;Let us go and die <I>with our Master,</I> who is now exposing himself to death by venturing into Judea;&#146;&#146; and so I rather think it is meant. &quot;If he will go into danger, let us also go and take our lot with him, according to the command we received, <I>Follow me.&#146;&#146;</I> Thomas knew so much of the malice of the Jews against Christ, and the counsels of God concerning him, which he had often told them of, that it was no foreign supposition that he was now going to die. And now Thomas manifests, <I>First,</I> A gracious readiness to die with Christ himself, flowing from strong affections to him, though his faith was weak, as appeared afterwards, <a href="/john/14-5.html">ch.&nbsp;14:5</a> ; 20:25. <I>Where thou diest I </I> <I>will die,</I> <a href="/ruth/1-17.html">Ruth.&nbsp;1:17</a> . <I>Secondly,</I> A zealous desire to help his fellow-disciples into the same frame: <I>&quot;Let us go,</I> one and all, and <I>die with him;</I> if they stone him, let them stone us; who would desire to survive such a Master?&#146;&#146; Thus, in difficult times, Christians should animate one another. We may each of us say, <I>Let us die with him.</I> Note, The consideration of the dying of the Lord Jesus should make us willing to die whenever God calls for us.</p><p><a name="Joh11_17"></a><a name="Joh11_18"></a><a name="Joh11_19"></a><a name="Joh11_20"></a><a name="Joh11_21"></a><a name="Joh11_22"></a><a name="Joh11_23"></a><a name="Joh11_24"></a><a name="Joh11_25"></a><a name="Joh11_26"></a><a name="Joh11_27"></a><a name="Joh11_28"></a><a name="Joh11_29"></a><a name="Joh11_30"></a><a name="Joh11_31"></a><a name="Joh11_32"></a> <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=John+11:17-32">Verses 17-32</a> The matter being determined, that Christ will go to Judea, and his disciples with him, they address themselves to their journey; in this journey some circumstances happened which the other evangelists record, as the healing of the blind man at Jericho, and the conversion of Zaccheus. We must not reckon ourselves out of our way, while we are in the way of doing good; nor be so intent upon one good office as to neglect another.At length, he comes near to Bethany, which is said to be about <I>fifteen furlongs</I> from Jerusalem, about two measured miles, <a href="/john/11-18.html">v.&nbsp;18</a>. Notice is taken of this, that this miracle was in effect wrought <I>in Jerusalem,</I> and so was put to her score. Christ&#146;s miracles in Galilee were more <I>numerous,</I> but those in or near Jerusalem were more <I>illustrious;</I> there he healed one that had been diseased <I>thirty-eight years,</I> another that had been blind <I>from his birth,</I> and raised one that had been dead <I>four days.</I> To Bethany Christ came, and observe,I. What posture he found his friends there in. When he had been last with them it is probable that he left them well, in health and joy; but when we part from our friends (though Christ knew) we know not what changes may affect us or them before we meet again.1. He found his friend Lazarus <I>in the grave,</I> <a href="/john/11-17.html">v.&nbsp;17</a>. When he came near the town, probably by the burying-place belonging to the town, he was told by the neighbours, or some persons whom he met, that Lazarus had been <I>four days buried.</I> Some think that Lazarus died the same day that the messenger came to Jesus with the tidings of his sickness, and so reckon two days for his abode in the same place and two days for his journey. I rather think that Lazarus died at the very instant that Jesus, <I>&quot;Our friend sleepeth,</I> he is now newly fallen asleep;&#146;&#146; and that the time between his death and burial (which among the Jews was but short), with the four days of his lying in the grave, was taken up in this journey; for Christ travelled publicly, as appears by his passing through Jericho, and his abode at Zaccheus&#146;s house took up some time. Promised salvations, though they always come surely, yet often come slowly.2. He found his friends that survived <I>in grief.</I> Martha and Mary were almost swallowed up with sorrow for the death of their brother, which is intimated where it is said that <I>many of the </I> <I>Jews came to Martha and Mary to comfort them.</I> Note, (1.) Ordinarily, where death is there are <I>mourners,</I> especially when those that were agreeable and amiable to their relations, and serviceable to their generation, are taken away. The house where death is called <I>the house of </I> <I>mourning,</I> <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-2.html">Eccl.&nbsp;7:2</a> . When man goes to his long home the <I>mourners go about the streets</I> (<a href="/ecclesiastes/12-5.html">Eccl.&nbsp;12:5</a> ), or rather sit alone, and <I>keep silence.</I> Here was Martha&#146;s house, a house where the fear of God was, and on which his blessing rested, yet made a <I>house of mourning.</I> Grace will keep sorrow from the heart <a href="/john/14-1.html">ch.&nbsp;14:1</a> ), not from the house. (2.) Where there are mourners there ought to be comforters. It is a duty we owe to those that are in sorrow to mourn with them, and to comfort them; and our mourning with them will be some comfort to them. When we are under the present impressions of grief, we are apt to forget those things which would minister comfort to us, and therefore have need of remembrancers. It is a mercy to have remembrancers when we are in sorrow, and our duty to be remembrancers to those who are in sorrow. The Jewish doctors laid great stress upon this, obliging their disciples to make conscience of comforting the mourners after the burial of the dead. They comforted them <I>concerning their </I> <I>brother,</I> that is, by speaking to them of him, not only of the good name he left behind, but of the happy state he was gone to. When godly relations and friends are taken from us, whatever occasion we have to be afflicted concerning ourselves, who are left behind and miss them, we have reason to be comforted concerning those who are gone before us to a happiness where they have no need of us. This visit which the Jews made to Martha and Mary is an evidence that they were persons of distinction, and made a figure; as also that they behaved obligingly to all; so that though they were followers of Christ, yet those who had no respect for him were civil to them. There was also a providence in it, that so many Jews, Jewish ladies it is probable, should come together, just at this time, to comfort the mourners, that they might be unexceptionable witnesses of the miracle, and see what miserable comforters they were, in comparison with Christ. Christ did not usually send for witnesses to his miracles, and yet had none been by but relations this would have been excepted against; therefore God&#146;s counsel so ordered it that these should come together accidentally, to bear their testimony to it, that infidelity might stop her mouth.II. What passed between him and his surviving friends at this interview. When Christ defers his visits for a time they are thereby made the more acceptable, much the more welcome; so it was here. His departures endear his returns, and his absence teaches us how to value his presence. We have here,1. The interview between Christ and Martha.(1.) We are told that she <I>went and met him,</I> <a href="/john/11-20.html">v.&nbsp;20</a>. [1.] It should seem that Martha was earnestly expecting Christ&#146;s arrival, and enquiring for it. Either she had sent out messengers, to bring her tidings of his first approach, or she had often asked, <I>Saw you him whom my soul </I> <I>loveth?</I> so that the first who discovered him ran to her with the welcome news. However it was, she heard of his coming before he arrived. She had waited long, and often asked, <I>Is he </I> <I>come?</I> and could hear no tidings of him; but long-looked-for came at last. <I>At the end the vision </I> <I>will speak, and not lie.</I> [2.] Martha, when the good news was brought that Jesus was coming, threw all aside, and <I>went and met him,</I> in token of a most affectionate welcome. She waived all ceremony and compliment to the Jews who came to visit her, and hastened to go and meet Jesus. Note, When God by his grace or providence is coming towards us in ways of mercy and comfort, we should go forth by faith, hope, and prayer to meet him. Some suggest that Martha went out of the town to meet Jesus, to let him know that there were several Jews in the house, who were no friends to him, that if he pleased he might keep out of the way of them. [3.] When Martha went to meet Jesus, Mary <I>sat still in the house.</I> Some think she did <I>not</I> hear the tidings, being in her drawing-room, receiving visits of condolence, while Martha who was busied in the household-affairs had early notice of it. Perhaps Martha would not tell her sister that Christ was coming, being ambitious of the honour of receiving him first. <I>Sancta est prudentia clam fratribus </I> <I>clam parentibus ad Christum esse conferre&#151;Holy prudence conducts us to Christ, while </I> <I>brethren and parents know not what we are doing.</I> &#151;Maldonat. in locum. Others think she <I>did</I> hear that Christ was come, but was so overwhelmed with sorrow that she did not care to stir, choosing rather to indulge her sorrow, and to sit poring upon her affliction, and saying, <I>I do well </I> <I>to</I> mourn. Comparing this story with that in <a href="/luke/10-38.html">Lu.&nbsp;10:38</a> ,  etc., we may observe the different tempers of these two sisters, and the temptations and advantages of each. Martha&#146;s natural temper was active and busy; she loved to be here and there, and at the end of every thing; and this had been a snare to her when by it she was not only careful and cumbered about many things, but hindered from the exercises of devotion: but now in a day of affliction this active temper did her a kindness, kept the grief from her heart, and made her forward to meet Christ, and so she received comfort from him the sooner. On the other hand, Mary&#146;s natural temper was contemplative and reserved. This had been formerly an advantage to her, when it placed her Christ&#146;s feet, to hear his word, and enabled her there to attend upon him without those distractions with which Martha was cumbered; but now in the day of affliction that same temper proved a snare to her, made her less able to grapple with her grief, and disposed her to melancholy: <I>But Mary sat still in the house.</I> See here how much it will be our wisdom carefully to watch against the temptations, and improve the advantages, of our natural temper.(2.) Here is fully related the discourse between Christ and Martha.[1.] Martha&#146;s address to Christ, <a href="/john/11-21.html">v.&nbsp;21</a>, <a href="/john/11-22.html">v.&nbsp;22</a>.<I>First,</I> She complains of Christ&#146;s long absence and delay. She said it, not only with grief for the death of her brother, but with some resentment of the seeming unkindness of the Master: <I>Lord if you hadst been here, my brother had not died.</I> Here is, 1. Some evidence of faith. She believed Christ&#146;s <I>power,</I> that, though her brother&#146;s sickness was very grievous, yet he could have cured it, and so have prevented his death. She believed his <I>pity,</I> that if he had but seen Lazarus in his extreme illness, and his dear relations all in tears about him, he would have had compassion, and have prevented so sad a breach, for his compassions fail not. But, 2. Here are sad instances of unbelief. Her faith was true, but weak as a bruised reed, for she limits the power of Christ, in saying, <I>If thou hadst been here;</I> whereas she ought to have known that Christ could cure at a distance, and that his gracious operations were not limited to his bodily presence. She reflects likewise upon the wisdom and kindness of Christ, that he did not hasten to them when they sent for him, as if he had not <I>timed his business</I> well, and now might as well have staid away, and not have come at all, as to come too late; and, as for any help now, she can scarcely entertain the thought of it.<I>Secondly,</I> Yet she corrects and comforts herself with the thoughts of the prevailing interest Christ had in heaven; at least, she blames herself for blaming her Master, and for suggesting that he comes too late: <I>for I know that even now,</I> desperate as the case is, <I>whatsoever thou wilt ask </I> <I>of God, God will give it to thee.</I> Observe, 1. How <I>willing</I> her hope was. Though she had not courage to ask of Jesus that he should raise him to life again, there having been no precedent as yet of any one raised to life that had been so long dead, yet, like a modest petitioner, she humbly recommends the case to the wise and compassionate consideration of the Lord Jesus. When we know not what in particular to ask or expect, let us in general refer ourselves to God, let him do as seemeth him good. <I>Judicii tui est, non praesumptionis meae&#151;I leave it to thy </I> <I>judgment, not to my presumption.</I> &#151;Aug. in locum. When we know not what to pray for, it is our comfort that the great Intercessor knows what to ask for us, and is always heard. 2. How <I>weak</I> her faith was. She should have said, &quot;Lord, thou canst do whatsoever thou wilt;&#146;&#146; but she only says, &quot;Thou canst obtain whatsoever thou prayest for.&#146;&#146; She had forgotten that the Son had <I>life </I> <I>in himself,</I> that he wrought miracles by his own power. Yet both these considerations must be taken in for the encouragement of our faith and hope, and neither excluded: the dominion Christ has on earth and his interest and intercession in heaven. He has in the one hand the golden sceptre, and in the other the golden censer; his power is always predominant, his intercession always prevalent.[2.] The comfortable word which Christ gave to Martha, in an answer to her pathetic address (<a href="/john/11-23.html">v.&nbsp;23</a>): <I>Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.</I> Martha, in her complaint, looked back, reflecting with regret <I>that Christ was not there,</I> for then, thinks she, my brother had been now alive. We are apt, in such cases, to add to our own trouble, by fancying what <I>might have been.</I> &quot;If such a method had been taken, such a physician employed, my friend had not died;&#146;&#146; which is more than we know: but what good does this do? When God&#146;s will is done, our business is to submit to him. Christ directs Martha, and us in her, to look forward, and to think what <I>shall be,</I> for that is a certainty, and yields sure comfort: <I>Thy brother shall rise again. </I> <I>First,</I> This was true of Lazarus in a sense peculiar to him: he was now presently to be raised; but Christ speaks of it in general as a thing to be done, not which he himself would do, so humbly did our Lord Jesus speak of what he did. He also expresses it <I>ambiguously,</I> leaving her uncertain at first whether he would raise him presently or not till the last day, that he might try her faith and patience. <I>Secondly,</I> It is applicable to all the saints, and their resurrection at the last day. Note, It is a matter of comfort to us, when we have buried our godly friends and relations, to think that they shall <I>rise again.</I> As the soul at death is not lost, but gone before, so the body is not lost, but laid up. Think you hear Christ saying, &quot;Thy parent, thy child, thy yoke-fellow, shall rise again; <I>these dry bones shall live.&#146;&#146;</I> [3.] The faith which Martha mixed with this word, and the unbelief mixed with this faith, <a href="/john/11-24.html">v.&nbsp;24</a>.<I>First,</I> She accounts it a <I>faithful saying</I> that <I>he shall rise again at the last day.</I> Though the doctrine of the resurrection was to have its full proof from Christ&#146;s resurrection, yet, as it was already revealed, she firmly believed it, <a href="/acts/24-15.html">Acts.&nbsp;24:15</a> . That there shall be a <I>last day,</I> with which all the days of time shall be numbered and finished. 2. That there shall be a <I>general</I> resurrection at that day, when the earth and sea shall give up their dead. That there shall be a <I>particular</I> resurrection of each one: &quot;I know that I shall rise again, and this and the other relation that was dear to me.&#146;&#146; As bone shall return to his bone in that day, so friend to his friend.<I>Secondly,</I> Yet she seems to think this saying not so well worthy of all acceptation as really it was: <I>&quot;I know he shall rise again at the last day;</I> but what are we the better for that now?&#146;&#146; As if the comforts of the resurrection to eternal life were not worth speaking of, or yielded not satisfaction sufficient to balance her affliction. See our weakness and folly, that we suffer present sensible things to make a deeper impression upon us, both of grief and joy, than those things which are the objects of faith. <I>I know that he shall rise again at the last day;</I> and is not this enough? She seems to think it is not. Thus, by our discontent under present crosses, we greatly undervalue our future hopes, and put a slight upon them, as if not worth regarding.[4.] The further instruction and encouragement which Jesus Christ gave her; for he will not quench the smoking flax nor break the bruised reed. He said to her, <I>I am the resurrection and </I> <I>the life,</I> <a href="/john/11-25.html">v.&nbsp;25</a>, <a href="/john/11-26.html">v.&nbsp;26</a>. Two things Christ possesses her with the belief of, in reference to the present distress; and they are the things which our faith should fasten upon in the like cases.<I>First,</I> The power of Christ, his sovereign power: <I>I am the resurrection and the life,</I> the fountain of life, and the head and author of the resurrection. Martha believed that at his prayer God would give any thing, but he would have her know that by his word he could work anything. Martha believed a resurrection at the <I>last day;</I> Christ tells her that he had that power lodged in his own hand, that the dead were to <I>hear his voice</I> <a href="/john/5-25.html">ch.&nbsp;5:25</a> ), whence it was easy to infer, He that could raise a world of men that had been dead many ages could doubtless raise one man that had been dead but <I>four days.</I> Note, It is an unspeakable comfort to all good Christians that Jesus Christ is the resurrection and the life, and will be so to them. <I>Resurrection</I> is a return to life; Christ is the author of that return, and of that life to which it is a return. We look for the <I>resurrection of the dead</I> and the <I>life of the world to come,</I> and Christ is both; the author and principle of both, and the ground of our hope of both.<I>Secondly,</I> The promises of the new covenant, which give us further ground of hope that <I>we </I> <I>shall live.</I> Observe,<I>a.</I> To whom these promises are made&#151;to those that believe in Jesus Christ, to those that consent to, and confide in, Jesus Christ as the only Mediator of reconciliation and communion between God and man, that receive the record God has given in his word concerning his Son, sincerely comply with it, and answer all the great intentions of it. The condition of the latter promise is thus expressed: <I>Whosoever liveth and believeth in me,</I> which may be understood, either, (<I>a.</I> ) Of <I>natural</I> life: <I>Whosoever lives in this world,</I> whether he be Jew or Gentile, wherever he lives, if he believe in Christ, he shall live by him. Yet it limits the time: Whoever during <I>life,</I> while he is here in this state of probation, <I>believes in me,</I> shall be happy in me, but after death it will be too late. Whoever <I>lives</I> and <I>believes,</I> that is, lives by faith (<a href="/galatians/2-20.html">Gal.&nbsp;2:20</a> ), has a faith that influences his conversation. Or, (<I>b.</I> ) Of <I>spiritual</I> life: He that <I>lives</I> and <I>believes</I> is he that by faith is born again to a heavenly and divine life, to whom <I>to live is Christ</I> &#151;that makes Christ the life of his soul.<I>b.</I> What the promises are (<a href="/john/11-25.html">v.&nbsp;25</a>): <I>Though he die, yet shall he live,</I> nay, <I>he shall never die,</I> <a href="/john/11-26.html">v.&nbsp;26</a>. Man consists of body and soul, and provision is made for the happiness of both.(<I>a.</I> ) For the <I>body;</I> here is the promise of a <I>blessed resurrection.</I> Though the body be dead because of sin (there is no remedy but it will die), yet it <I>shall live again.</I> All the difficulties that attend the state of the dead are here overlooked, and made nothing of. Though the sentence of death was just, though the effects of death be dismal, though the bands of death be strong, though he be dead and buried, dead and putrefied, though the scattered dust be so mixed with common dust that no art of man can distinguish, much less separate them, put the case as strongly as you will on that side, yet we are sure that <I>he shall live</I> again: the body shall be raised a glorious body.(<I>b.</I> ) For the <I>soul;</I> here is the promise of a <I>blessed immortality.</I> He that <I>liveth and believeth,</I> who, being united to Christ by faith, lives spiritually by virtue of that union, he shall <I>never die.</I> That spiritual life shall never be extinguished, but perfected in eternal life. As the soul, being in its nature spiritual, is therefore immortal; so if by faith it live a spiritual life, consonant to its nature, its felicity shall be immortal too. It <I>shall never die,</I> shall never be otherwise than easy and happy, and there is not any intermission or interruption of its life, as there is of the life of the body. The <I>mortality</I> of the body shall at length be <I>swallowed up of life;</I> but the life of the soul, the believing soul, shall be immediately at death swallowed up of immortality. <I>He shall not die,</I> <I>eis ton aiona</I> , <I>for ever&#151;Non morietur in aeternum;</I> so Cyprian quotes it. The body shall not be <I>for ever</I> dead in the grave; it dies (like the two witnesses) but for a <I>time, times, and the </I> <I>dividing of time;</I> and when time shall be no more, and all the divisions of it shall be numbered and finished, a <I>spirit of life from God shall enter into it.</I> But this is not all; the souls shall not die that death which is <I>for ever,</I> shall <I>not die eternally, Blessed and holy,</I> that is, blessed and happy, is he that by faith <I>has part in the first resurrection,</I> has part in Christ, who is that resurrection; for on such the <I>second death,</I> which is a death for ever, <I>shall have no power;</I> see <a href="/john/6-40.html">ch.&nbsp;6:40</a> . Christ asks her, <I>&quot;Believest thou this?</I> Canst thou <I>assent</I> to it with application? Canst thou take my word for it?&#146;&#146; Note, When we have read or heard the word of Christ, concerning the great things of the other world, we should seriously put it to ourselves, <I>&quot;Do we believe this, this</I> truth in particular, <I>this</I> which is attended with so many difficulties, <I>this</I> which is suited to my case? Does my belief of it realize it to me, and give my soul an assurance of it, so that I can say not only <I>this</I> I believe, but <I>thus</I> I believe it?&#146;&#146; Martha was doting upon her brother&#146;s being raised in this world; before Christ gave her hopes of this, he directed her thoughts to another life, another world: &quot;No matter for <I>that,</I> but <I>believest thou this</I> that I tell thee concerning the <I>future</I> state?&#146;&#146; The crosses and comforts of this present time would not make such an impression upon us as they do if we did but believe the things of eternity as we ought.[5.] Martha&#146;s unfeigned assent yielded to what Christ said, <a href="/john/11-27.html">v.&nbsp;27</a>. We have here Martha&#146;s creed, the good confession she witnessed, the same with that for which Peter was commended (<a href="/matthew/16-16.html">Mt.&nbsp;16:16</a>, <a href="/matthew/16-17.html">Mt.&nbsp;16:17</a> ), and it is the <I>conclusion of the whole matter.</I> <I>First,</I> Here is the <I>guide of her faith,</I> and that is the word of Christ; without any alteration, exception, or proviso, she takes it entire as Christ had said it: <I>Yea, Lord,</I> whereby she subscribes to the truth of all and every part of that which Christ had promised, in his own sense: <I>Even so.</I> Faith is an echo to divine revelation, returns the same words, and resolves to abide by them: <I>Yea, Lord, As the word did make it so I believe and take it,</I> said queen Elizabeth.<I>Secondly,</I> The <I>ground of her faith,</I> and that is the authority of Christ; she believes <I>this</I> because she believes that he who saith it is Christ. She has recourse to the foundation for the support of the superstructure. <I>I believe,</I> <I>pepisteuka</I> , <I>&quot;I have believed</I> that thou art Christ, and therefore <I>I do believe this.&#146;&#146;</I> Observe here,<I>a.</I> What she believed and confessed concerning Jesus; three things, all to the same effect:&#151;(<I>a.</I> ) That he was the Christ, or Messiah, promised and expected under this name and notion, the <I>anointed one.</I> (<I>b.</I> ) That he was the <I>Son of God;</I> so the Messiah was called (<a href="/psalms/2-7.html">Ps.&nbsp;2:7</a> ), not by office only, but by nature. (<I>c.</I> ) That it was <I>he who should come</I> into the world, the <I>ho erchomenos</I> . That blessing of blessings which the church had for so many ages waited for as <I>future,</I> she embraced as <I>present.</I> <I>b.</I> What she inferred hence, and what she alleged this for. If she admits this, that Jesus is the Christ, there is no difficulty in believing that he is the resurrection and the life; for if he be the Christ, then, (<I>a.</I> ) He is the fountain of light and truth, and we may take all his sayings for faithful and divine, upon his own word. If he be the Christ, he is that prophet whom we are to hear <I>in </I> <I>all things.</I> (<I>b.</I> ) He is the fountain of life and blessedness, and we may therefore depend upon his ability as well as upon his veracity. How shall bodies, turned to dust, <I>live again?</I> How shall souls, clogged and clouded as ours are, <I>live for ever?</I> We could not believe this, but that we believe him that undertakes it to be <I>the Son of God,</I> who has life <I>in himself,</I> and has it for us.2. The interview between Christ and Mary the other sister. And here observe,(1.) The notice which Martha gave her of Christ&#146;s coming (<a href="/john/11-28.html">v.&nbsp;28</a>): <I>When she had so said,</I> as one that needed to say no more, <I>she went her way,</I> easy in her mind, and <I>called Mary her </I> <I>sister.</I> [1.] Martha, having received instruction and comfort from Christ herself, called her sister to share with her. Time was when Martha would have drawn Mary from Christ, to come and help her in <I>much serving</I> (<a href="/luke/10-40.html">Lu.&nbsp;10:40</a> ); but, to make her amends for this, here she is industrious to draw her to Christ. [2.] She called her <I>secretly,</I> and whispered it in her ear, because there was company by, Jews, who were no friends to Christ. The saints are called <I>into </I> <I>the fellowship of Jesus Christ</I> by an invitation that is secret and distinguishing, given to them and not to others; they have meat to eat that the world knows not of, joy that a stranger does not intermeddle with. [3.] She called her by order from Christ; he bade her <I>go call her sister.</I> This call that is <I>effectual,</I> whoever brings it, is sent by Christ. <I>The Master is come, and calleth for </I> <I>thee. First,</I> She calls Christ <I>the Master,</I> <I>didaskalos</I> , a <I>teaching master;</I> by that title he was commonly called and known among them. Mr. George Herbert took pleasure in calling Christ, <I>my Master. Secondly,</I> She triumphs in his arrival: <I>The Master is come.</I> He whom we have long wished and waited for, <I>he is come, he is come;</I> this was the best cordial in the present distress. &quot;Lazarus is gone, and our comfort in him is gone; but the <I>Master is come,</I> who is better than the dearest friend, and has that in him which will abundantly make up all our losses. He is come who is our <I>teacher,</I> who will teach us how to get good by our sorrow (<a href="/psalms/94-12.html">Ps.&nbsp;94:12</a> ), who will <I>teach,</I> and so comfort.&#146;&#146; <I>Thirdly,</I> She invites her sister to go and meet him: <I>&quot;He calls for thee,</I> enquires what is become of thee, and would have thee sent for.&#146;&#146; Note, When Christ our Master comes, he <I>calls for us.</I> He comes in his word and ordinances, calls us to them, calls us by them, calls us to himself. He calls for thee in particular, for thee <I>by name</I> (<a href="/psalms/27-8.html">Ps.&nbsp;27:8</a> ); and, if he call thee, he will cure thee, he will comfort thee.(2.) The haste which Mary made to Christ upon this notice given her (<a href="/john/11-29.html">v.&nbsp;29</a>): <I>As soon as </I> <I>she heard</I> this good news, that the <I>Master was come,</I> she <I>arose quickly,</I> and came to him. She little thought how near he was to her, for he is often nearer to them that mourn in Zion than they are aware of; but, when she knew how near he was, she started up, and in a transport of joy ran to meet him. The least intimation of Christ&#146;s gracious approaches is enough to a lively faith, which stands ready to take the hint, and answer the first call. When Christ was come, [1.] She did not consult the decorum of her mourning, but, forgetting ceremony, and the common usage in such cases, she ran through the town, to meet Christ. Let no nice punctilios of decency and honour deprive us at any time of opportunities of conversing with Christ. [2.] She did not consult her neighbours, the Jews that were <I>with her, comforting her;</I> she left them all, to come to him, and did not only not ask their advice, but not so much as ask their leave, or beg their pardon for her rudeness.(3.) We are told (<a href="/john/11-30.html">v.&nbsp;30</a>) where she found the Master; he was not yet come into Bethany, but was at the town&#146;s end, <I>in that place where Martha met him.</I> See here, [1.] Christ&#146;s love to his work. He staid near the place where the grave was, that he might be ready to go to it. He would not go into the town, to <I>refresh himself</I> after the fatigue of his journey, till he had done the work he came to do; nor would he go into the town, lest it should look like ostentation, and a design to levy a crowd to be spectators of the miracle. [2.] Mary&#146;s love to Christ; still she <I>loved </I> <I>much.</I> Though Christ had seemed unkind in his delays, yet she could take nothing amiss from him. Let us go thus to Christ <I>without the camp,</I> <a href="/hebrews/13-13.html">Heb.&nbsp;13:13</a> .(4.) The misconstruction which the Jews that were with Mary made of her going away so hastily (<a href="/john/11-31.html">v.&nbsp;31</a>): They said, <I>She goes to the grave, to weep there.</I> Martha bore up better under this affliction than Mary did, who was a woman of a tender and sorrowful spirit; such was her natural temper. Those that are so have need to watch against melancholy, and ought to be pitied and helped. These comforters found that their formalities did her no service, but that she hardened herself in sorrow: and therefore concluded when she went out, and turned that way, it was to go <I>to the grave</I> and <I>weep there.</I> See, [1.] What often is the folly and fault of mourners; they contrive how to aggravate their own grief, and to make bad worse. We are apt in such cases to take a strange pleasure in our own pain, and to say, <I>We do well</I> to be passionate in our grief, even unto death; we are apt to fasten upon those things that aggravate the affliction, and what good does this do us, when it is our duty to reconcile ourselves to the will of God in it? Why should mourners go to the grave to weep there, when they sorrow not as those that have no hope? Affliction of itself is grievous; why should we make it more so? [2.] What is the wisdom and duty of comforters; and that is, to prevent as much as may be, in those who grieve inordinately, the revival of the sorrow, and to divert it. Those Jews that followed Mary were thereby led to Christ, and became the witnesses of one of his most glorious miracles. It is good cleaving to Christ&#146;s friends in their sorrows, for thereby we may come to know him better.(5.) Mary&#146;s address to our Lord Jesus (<a href="/john/11-32.html">v.&nbsp;32</a>): She came, attended with her train of comforters, and <I>fell down at his feet,</I> as one overwhelmed with a passionate sorrow, and said with many tears (as appears <a href="/john/11-33.html">v.&nbsp;33</a>), <I>Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died,</I> as Martha said before, for they had often said it to one another. Now here, [1.] Her posture is very humble and submissive: <I>She fell down at his feet,</I> which was more than Martha did, who had a greater command of her passions. She fell down not as a sinking mourner, but fell down at his feet as a humble petitioner. This Mary had sat <I>at Christ&#146;s feet to hear his word</I> (<a href="/luke/10-39.html">Lu.&nbsp;10:39</a> ), and here we find her there on another errand. Note, Those that in a day of peace place themselves at Christ&#146;s feet, to receive instructions from him, may with comfort and confidence in a day of trouble cast themselves at his feet with hope to find favour with him. She <I>fell at his feet,</I> as one submitting to his will in what was done, and referring herself to his good-will in what was now to be done. When we are in affliction we must cast ourselves at Christ&#146;s feet in a penitent sorrow and self-abasement for sin, and a patient resignation of ourselves to the divine disposal. Mary&#146;s casting herself at Christ&#146;s feet was in token of the profound respect and veneration she had for him. Thus subjects were wont to give honour to their kings and princes; but, our Lord Jesus not appearing in secular glory as an earthly prince, those who by this posture of adoration gave honour to him certainly looked upon him as more than man, and intended hereby to give him divine honour. Mary hereby made profession of the Christian faith as truly as Martha did, and in effect said, <I>I believe that thou art the Christ; bowing the knee to</I> Christ, and <I>confessing him </I> <I>with the tongue,</I> are put together as equivalent, <a href="/romans/14-11.html">Rom.&nbsp;14:11</a> ; <a href="/philippians/2-10.html">Phil.&nbsp;2:10</a>, <a href="/philippians/2-11.html">Phil.&nbsp;2:11</a> . This she did in presence of <I>the Jews</I> that attended her, who, though friends to her and her family, yet were bitter enemies to Christ; yet in their sight she fell at Christ&#146;s feet, as one that was neither ashamed to own the veneration she had for Christ nor afraid of disobliging her friends and neighbours by it. Let them resent it as they pleased, she falls at his feet; and, if this be to be vile, she will be yet more vile; see <a href="/song-of-solomon/8-1.html">Cant.&nbsp;8:1</a> . We serve a Master of whom we have no reason to be ashamed, and whose acceptance of our services is sufficient to balance the reproach of men and all their revilings. [2.] Her address is very pathetic: <I>Lord, if thou hadst been here, my </I> <I>brother had not died.</I> Christ&#146;s delay was designed for the best, and proved so; yet both the sisters very indecently <I>cast the same in his teeth,</I> and in effect charge him with the death of their brother. This repeated challenge he might justly have resented, might have told them he had something else to do than to be at their beck and to attend them; he must come when his business would permit him: but not a word of this; he considered the circumstances of their affliction, and that losers think they may have leave to speak, and therefore overlooked the rudeness of this welcome, and gave us an example of mildness and meekness in such cases. Mary added no more, as Martha did; but it appears, by what follows, that what she fell short in words she made up in tears; she said less than Martha, but wept more; and tears of devout affection have a voice, a loud prevailing voice, in the ears of Christ; no rhetoric like this.</p></span><div class="Global-Page-Links"><a class="Previous" href="/commentaries/matthew-henry-complete/john/11.html">Prev</a><div class="GlobalPageLinksContainer"><ul><a name="PageLink-1" class="PageLink-1 active" href="/commentaries/matthew-henry-complete/john/11.html" >1</a><a name="PageLink-2" class="PageLink-2 " href="/commentaries/matthew-henry-complete/john/11.html?p=2" >2</a></ul>
