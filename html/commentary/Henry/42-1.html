		<span id="Page-1" style=""><b><a href="/luke/1.html">Chapter&nbsp;1</a></b><P>The narrative which this evangelist gives us (or rather God by him) of the life of Christ begins earlier than either Matthew or Mark. We have reason to thank God for them all, as we have for all the gifts and graces of Christ&#146;s ministers, which in one make up what is wanting in the other, while all put together make a harmony. In this chapter we have, <I>I. Luke&#146;s preface to his gospel, or his epistle dedicatory to his friend Theophilus (<a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=luke+1:1-4">v.&nbsp;1-4</a>). II. The prophecy and history of the conception of John Baptist, who was Christ&#146;s forerunner (<a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=luke+1:5-25">v.&nbsp;5-25</a>). The annunciation of the virgin Mary, or the notice given to her that she should be the mother of the Messiah (<a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=luke+1:26-38">v.&nbsp;26-38</a>). IV. The interview between Mary the mother of Jesus and Elisabeth the mother of John, when they were both with child of those pregnant births, and the prophecies they both uttered upon that occasion (<a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=luke+1:39-56">v.&nbsp;39-56</a>). V. The birth and circumcision of John Baptist, six months before the birth of Christ (<a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=luke+1:57-66">v.&nbsp;57-66</a>). VI. Zacharias&#146;s song of praise, in thankfulness for the birth of John, and in prospect of the birth of Jesus (<a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=luke+1:67-79">v.&nbsp;67-79</a>). VII. A short account of John Baptist&#146;s infancy (<a href="/luke/1-80.html">v.&nbsp;80</a>). And these do more than give us an entertaining narrative; they will lead us into the understanding of the mystery of godliness, God manifest in the flesh.</I></p><p><a name="Lu1_1"></a><a name="Lu1_2"></a><a name="Lu1_3"></a><a name="Lu1_4"></a> <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Luke+1:1-4">Verses 1-4</a> Complimental prefaces and dedications, the language of flattery and the food and fuel of pride, are justly condemned by the wise and good; but it doth not therefore follow, that such as are useful and instructive are to be run down; such is this, in which St. Luke dedicates his gospel to his friend Theophilus, not as to his <I>patron,</I> though he was a man of honour, to protect it, but as to his <I>pupil,</I> to learn it, and hold it fast. It is not certain who this Theophilus was; the name signifies a <I>friend of God;</I> some think that it does not mean any particular person, but every one that is a <I>lover of God;</I> Dr. Hammond quotes some of the ancients understanding it so: and then it teaches us, that those who are truly lovers of God, will heartily welcome the gospel of Christ, the design and tendency of which are, to bring us to God. But it is rather to be understood of some particular person, probably a magistrate; because Luke gives him here the same title of respect which St. Paul gave to Festus the governor, <I>kratiste</I> (<a href="/acts/26-25.html">Acts.&nbsp;26:25</a> ), which we there translate <I>most noble Festus,</I> and here <I>most excellent Theophilus.</I> Note, Religion does not destroy civility and good manners, but teaches us, according to the usages of our country, to <I>give honour to them to whom honour is due.</I> Now observe here, I. Why St. Luke wrote this gospel. It is certain that he was moved by the Holy Ghost, not only <I>to</I> the writing, but <I>in</I> the writing of it; but in both he was moved as a reasonable creature, and not as a mere machine; and he was made to consider,1. That the things he wrote of were things that were <I>most surely believed among all </I> <I>Christians,</I> and therefore things which they ought to be instructed in, that they may know what they believe, and things which ought to be transmitted to posterity (who are as much concerned in them as we are); and, in order to that, to be committed to writing, which is the surest way of conveyance to the ages to come. He will not write about things of <I>doubtful disputation,</I> things about which Christians may safely differ from one another and hesitate within themselves; but the things which are, and ought to be, most <I>surely believed,</I> <I>pragmata </I> <I>peplerophoremena</I> &#151;<I>the things which were performed</I> (so some), which Christ and his apostles did, and did with such circumstances as gave a full assurance that they were really done, so that they have gained an established lasting credit. Note, Though it is not the foundation of our faith, yet it is a support to it, that the articles of our creed are things that have been long <I>most surely believed.</I> The doctrine of Christ is what thousands of the wisest and best of men have <I>ventured their souls upon</I> with the greatest assurance and satisfaction.2. That it was requisite there should be a <I>declaration made in order</I> of those things; that the history of the life of Christ should be <I>methodized,</I> and committed to writing, for the greater certainty of the conveyance. When things are <I>put in order,</I> we know the better where to <I>find </I> <I>them</I> for <I>our own</I> use, and how to <I>keep</I> them for the benefit of <I>others.</I> 3. That there were <I>many who had undertaken</I> to <I>publish</I> narratives of the <I>life of Christ,</I> many well-meaning people, who <I>designed</I> well, and <I>did</I> well, and what they published had <I>done </I> <I>good,</I> though not done by divine inspiration, nor so well done as might be, nor intended for perpetuity. Note, (1.) The labours of others in the gospel of Christ, if faithful and honest, we ought to <I>commend</I> and <I>encourage,</I> and not to <I>despise,</I> though chargeable with many deficiencies. (2.) Others&#146; services to Christ must not be reckoned to supersede ours, but rather to quicken them.4. That the truth of the things he had to write was <I>confirmed</I> by the <I>concurring testimony</I> of those who were competent and unexceptionable witnesses of them; what had been published in writing already, and what he was now about to publish, agreed with that which had been delivered by word of mouth, over and over, by those who from the beginning were <I>eye-witnesses and ministers of the word,</I> <a href="/luke/1-2.html">v.&nbsp;2</a>. Note, (1.) The apostles were <I>ministers of the </I> <I>word</I> of Christ, who is <I>the Word</I> (so some understand it), or of the doctrine of Christ; they, having received it themselves, ministered it to others, <a href="/1-john/1-1.html">1 Jn.&nbsp;1:1</a> . They had not a gospel to make as masters, but a gospel to preach as ministers. (2.) The <I>ministers of the word</I> were <I>eye-witnesses</I> of the things which they preached, and, which is also included, <I>ear-witnesses.</I> They did themselves <I>hear</I> the doctrine of Christ, and <I>see</I> his miracles, and had them not by report, at second hand; and therefore they could not but speak, with the greatest assurance, the things which they had <I>seen and heard,</I> <a href="/acts/4-20.html">Acts.&nbsp;4:20</a> . (3.) They were so <I>from the beginning</I> of Christ&#146;s ministry, <a href="/luke/1-2.html">v.&nbsp;2</a>. He had his disciples with him when he wrought his <I>first miracle,</I> <a href="/john/2-11.html">Jn.&nbsp;2:11</a> . They <I>companied with him all the time he went in and out among them</I> (<a href="/acts/1-21.html">Acts.&nbsp;1:21</a> ), so that they not only heard and saw all that which was sufficient to confirm their faith, but, if there had been any thing to shock it, they had opportunity to discover it. (4.) The <I>written</I> gospel, which we have to <I>this day,</I> exactly agrees with the gospel which was <I>preached</I> in the <I>first days</I> of the church. (5.) That he himself had a <I>perfect understanding</I> of the <I>things</I> he wrote of, <I>from the first,</I> <a href="/luke/1-3.html">v.&nbsp;3</a>. Some think that here is a tacit reflection upon those who had written before him, that they had not a <I>perfect understanding</I> of what they wrote, and therefore, <I>Here am I, send me (&#151;facit </I> <I>indignatio versum&#151;my wrath impels my pen);</I> or rather, without reflecting on them, he asserts his own ability for this undertaking: &quot;It seemed good to me, having attained to the exact knowledge of all things, <I>anothen</I> &#151;<I>from above;&#146;&#146;</I> so I think it should be rendered; for if he meant the same with <I>from the beginning</I> (<a href="/luke/1-2.html">v.&nbsp;2</a>), as our translation intimates, he would have used the same word. [1.] He had diligently <I>searched</I> into these things, had <I>followed</I> after them (so the word is), as the Old-Testament prophets are said to have <I>enquired</I> and <I>searched diligently,</I> <a href="/1-peter/1-10.html">1 Pt.&nbsp;1:10</a> . He had not taken things so easily and superficially as others who had written before him, but made it his business to inform himself concerning particulars. [2.] He had received his intelligence, not only by tradition, as others had done, but by revelation, confirming that tradition, and securing him from any error or mistake in the recording of it. He sought it <I>from </I> <I>above</I> (so the word intimates), and from thence he had it; thus, like Elihu, he <I>fetched his </I> <I>knowledge</I> from afar. He wrote his history as Moses wrote his, of things <I>reported</I> by tradition, but <I>ratified</I> by inspiration. [3.] He could therefore say that he had a <I>perfect understanding</I> of these things. He knew them, <I>akribos</I> &#151;<I>accurately,</I> exactly. &quot;Now, having received this <I>from </I> <I>above,</I> it seemed good to me to communicate it;&#146;&#146; for such a talent as this ought not to be buried.II. Observe why he sent it to <I>Theophilus:</I> &quot;I wrote unto thee these things <I>in order,</I> not that thou mayest give reputation to the work, but that thou mayest be edified by it (<a href="/luke/1-4.html">v.&nbsp;4</a>); <I>that thou mayest </I> <I>know the certainty of those things wherein thou has been instructed.&#146;&#146;</I> 1. It is implied, that he had been <I>instructed</I> in these things either before his baptism, or since, or both, according to the rule, <a href="/matthew/28-19.html">Mt.&nbsp;28:19</a>, <a href="/matthew/28-20.html">Mt.&nbsp;28:20</a> . Probably, Luke had baptized him, and knew how well instructed he was; <I>peri </I> <I>hon katechethes</I> &#151;<I>concerning which thou hast been catechized;</I> so the word is; the most knowing Christians began with being catechized. Theophilus was a person of quality, perhaps of noble birth; and so much the more pains should be taken with such when they are young, to teach them the principles of the oracles of God, that they may be fortified against temptations, and furnished for the opportunities, of a high condition in the world. 2. It was intended that he should <I>know the certainty of those things,</I> should understand them more clearly and believe more firmly. There is a <I>certainty</I> in the gospel of Christ, there is that therein which we may build upon; and those who have been well instructed in the things of God when they were young should afterwards give diligence to <I>know the certainty</I> of those things, to know not only what we believe, but why we believe it, that we may be able to give a <I>reason of the hope that is in us.</I> </p><p><a name="Lu1_5"></a><a name="Lu1_6"></a><a name="Lu1_7"></a><a name="Lu1_8"></a><a name="Lu1_9"></a><a name="Lu1_10"></a><a name="Lu1_11"></a><a name="Lu1_12"></a><a name="Lu1_13"></a><a name="Lu1_14"></a><a name="Lu1_15"></a><a name="Lu1_16"></a><a name="Lu1_17"></a><a name="Lu1_18"></a><a name="Lu1_19"></a><a name="Lu1_20"></a><a name="Lu1_21"></a><a name="Lu1_22"></a><a name="Lu1_23"></a><a name="Lu1_24"></a><a name="Lu1_25"></a> <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Luke+1:5-25">Verses 5-25</a> The two preceding evangelists had agreed to begin the gospel with the baptism of John and his ministry, which commenced about six months before our Saviour&#146;s public ministry (and now, things being near a crisis, six months was <I>a deal</I> of time, which before was but <I>a little</I> ), and therefore this evangelist, designing to give a more particular account than had been given of our Saviour&#146;s conception and birth, determines to do so of John Baptist, who in both was his harbinger and forerunner, the morning-star to the Sun of righteousness. The evangelist determines thus, not only because it is commonly reckoned a satisfaction and entertainment to know something of the original extraction and early days of those who afterwards prove great men, but because in the beginning of these there were many things miraculous, and presages of what they afterwards proved. In these verses our inspired historian begins as early as the conception of John Baptist. Now observe here,I. The account given of <I>his parents</I> (<a href="/luke/1-5.html">v.&nbsp;5</a>): They lived <I>in the days of Herod the king,</I> who was a foreigner, and a deputy for the Romans, who had lately made Judea a province of the empire. This is taken notice of to show that the sceptre was quite departed from Judah, and therefore that now was the time for Shiloh to come, according to Jacob&#146;s prophecy, <a href="/genesis/49-10.html">Gen.&nbsp;49:10</a> . The family of David was now sunk, when it was to rise, and flourish again, in the Messiah. Note, None ought to despair of the reviving and flourishing of religion, even when civil liberties are lost. Israel enslaved, yet then comes the glory of Israel.Now the father of John Baptist was a priest, a son of Aaron; his name <I>Zacharias.</I> No families in the world were ever so honoured of God as those of Aaron and David; with one was made the covenant of priesthood, with the other that of royalty; they had both forfeited their honour, yet the gospel again puts honour upon both in their latter days, on that of Aaron in John Baptist, on that of David in Christ, and then they were both extinguished and lost. Christ was of David&#146;s house, his forerunner of Aaron&#146;s; for his priestly agency and influence opened the way to his kingly authority and dignity. This Zacharias was <I>of the course of Abia.</I> When in David&#146;s time the family of Aaron was multiplied, he divided them into twenty-four courses, for the more regular performances of their office, that it might never be either <I>neglected</I> for want of hands or <I>engrossed</I> by a few. The eighth of those was that of <I>Abia</I> (<a href="/1-chronicles/24-10.html">1 Chr.&nbsp;24:10</a> ), who was descended from Eleazar, Aaron&#146;s eldest son; but Dr. Lightfoot suggests that many of the families of the priests were lost in the captivity, so that after their return they took in those of other families, retaining the names of the heads of the respective courses. The wife of this Zacharias was of the daughters of Aaron too, and her name was <I>Elisabeth,</I> the very same name with <I>Elisheba</I> the wife of Aaron, <a href="/exodus/6-23.html">Ex.&nbsp;6:23</a> . The priests (Josephus saith) was very careful to marry within their own family, that they might maintain the dignity of the priesthood and keep it without mixture.Now that which is observed concerning Zacharias and Elisabeth is,1. That they were a very religious couple (<a href="/luke/1-6.html">v.&nbsp;6</a>): <I>They were both righteous before God;</I> they were so in his sight whose judgment, we are sure, is <I>according to truth;</I> they were sincerely and really so. They are righteous indeed that are so <I>before God,</I> as Noah in his generation, <a href="/genesis/7-1.html">Gen.&nbsp;7:1</a> . They <I>approved</I> themselves <I>to him,</I> and he was graciously pleased to accept them. It is a happy thing when those who are joined to each other in marriage are both <I>joined to the Lord;</I> and it is especially requisite that the priests, the Lord&#146;s ministers, should with their yoke-fellows be <I>righteous before God,</I> that they may be <I>examples to the flock,</I> and rejoice their hearts. <I>They </I> <I>walked in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord, blameless.</I> (1.) Their being <I>righteous before God</I> was evidenced by the course and tenour of their conversations; they showed it, not by their talk, but by their <I>works;</I> by the way they walked in and the rule they walked by. (2.) They were <I>of a piece</I> with themselves; for their devotions and their conversations agreed. They walked not only in the <I>ordinances</I> of the Lord, which related to divine worship, but in the <I>commandments</I> of the Lord, which have reference to all the instances of a good conversation, and must be regarded. (3.) They were universal in their obedience; not that they never did in any thing <I>come short</I> of their duty, but it was their constant care and endeavor to <I>come up</I> to it. (4.) Herein, though they were not <I>sinless,</I> yet they were <I>blameless;</I> nobody could charge them with any open scandalous sin; they lived <I>honestly</I> and <I>inoffensively,</I> as ministers and their families are in a special manner concerned to do, that the ministry be not blamed in <I>their</I> blame.2. That they had been long <I>childless,</I> <a href="/luke/1-7.html">v.&nbsp;7</a>. Children are a <I>heritage of the Lord.</I> But there are many of his heirs in a married state, that yet are denied this <I>heritage;</I> they are valuable desirable blessings; yet many there are, who are <I>righteous before God,</I> and, if they had children, would bring them up in his fear, who yet are not thus blessed, while the <I>men of this world</I> are <I>full of </I> <I>children</I> (<a href="/psalms/17-14.html">Ps.&nbsp;17:14</a> ), <I>and send forth their little ones like a flock,</I> <a href="/job/21-11.html">Job.&nbsp;21:11</a> . Elisabeth was <I>barren,</I> and they began to despair of ever having children, for they were both now <I>well </I> <I>stricken in years,</I> when the women that have been most fruitful <I>leave off bearing.</I> Many eminent persons were born of mothers that had been long childless, as Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Samson, Samuel, and so here John Baptist, to make their birth the more remarkable and the blessing of it the more valuable to their parents, and to show that when God keeps his people long waiting for mercy he sometimes is pleased to recompense them for their patience by <I>doubling</I> the worth of it when it comes.II. The appearing of an angel to his father Zacharias, as he was ministering in the temple, <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=luke+1:8-11">v.&nbsp;8-11</a>. Zechariah the prophet was the last of the Old Testament that was conversant with angels, and Zacharias the priest the first in the New Testament. Observe,1. How Zacharias was employed in the service of God (<a href="/luke/1-8.html">v.&nbsp;8</a>): He <I>executed the priest&#146;s </I> <I>office, before God, in the order of his course;</I> it was his <I>week of waiting,</I> and he was <I>upon </I> <I>duty.</I> Though his family was not built up, or made to grow, yet he made conscience of doing the work of his own place and day. Though we have not <I>desired mercies,</I> yet we must keep close to <I>enjoined services;</I> and, in our diligent and constant attendance on them, we may hope that mercy and comfort will come at last. Now it fell to Zacharias&#146;s lot to burn incense morning and evening for that week of his waiting, as other services fell to other priests <I>by lot</I> likewise. The services were directed by lot, that some might not decline them and others engross them, and that, the <I>disposal of the lot</I> being <I>from the Lord,</I> they might have the satisfaction of a divine call to the work. This was not the high priest burning incense on the day of atonement, as some have fondly imagined, who have thought by that to find out the time of our Saviour&#146;s birth; but it is plain that it was the burning of the daily incense at the <I>altar of incense</I> (<a href="/luke/1-11.html">v.&nbsp;11</a>), which was <I>in the </I> <I>temple</I> (<a href="/luke/1-9.html">v.&nbsp;9</a>), not in the most holy place, into which the high priest entered. The Jews say that one and the same priest burned not incense twice in all his days (there were such a multitude of them), at least never more than one week. It is very probable that this was <I>upon the sabbath </I> <I>day,</I> because there was a <I>multitude of people</I> attending (<a href="/luke/1-10.html">v.&nbsp;10</a>), which ordinarily was not on a week day; and thus God usually puts honour upon <I>his own day.</I> And then if Dr. Lightfoot reckon, with the help of the Jewish calender, that this course of Abia fell on the seventeenth day of the third month, the month Sivan, answering to part of May and part of June, it is worth observing that the portions of the law and the prophets which were read this day in synagogues were very agreeable to that which was doing in the temple; namely, the law of the Nazarites (<a href="/numbers/6.html">Num.&nbsp;6</a>, ), and the conception of Samson, <a href="/judges/13.html">Jdg.&nbsp;13</a>, .While Zacharias was burning incense in the temple, <I>the whole multitude of the people were </I> <I>praying without,</I> <a href="/luke/1-10.html">v.&nbsp;10</a>. Dr. Lightfoot says that there were constantly in the temple, at the hour of prayer, the priests of the course that then served, and, if it were the sabbath day, those of that course also that had been in waiting the week before, and the Levites that served under the priests, and the <I>men of the station,</I> as the Rabbin call them, who were the representatives of the people, in putting their hands upon the head of the sacrifices, and many besides, who, moved by devotion, left their employments, for that time, to be present at the service of God; and those would make up <I>a great multitude,</I> especially on sabbaths and feast-days: now these all addressed themselves to their devotions (in mental prayer, for their voice was not heard), when by the tinkling of a bell they had notice that the priest was gone in to burn incense. Now observe here, (1.) That the true Israel of God always were a <I>praying</I> people; and prayer is the great and principal piece of service by which we give honour to God, fetch in favours from him, and keep up our communion with him. (2.) That <I>then,</I> when ritual and ceremonial appointments were in full force, as this of <I>burning incense,</I> yet moral and spiritual duties were required to go along with them, and were principally looked at. David knew that when he was at a distance from the altar his prayer might be heard <I>without incense,</I> for it might be directed before God <I>as </I> <I>incense,</I> <a href="/psalms/141-2.html">Ps.&nbsp;141:2</a> . But, when he was <I>compassing the altar,</I> the incense could not be accepted <I>without prayer,</I> any more than the shell without the kernel. (3.) That is not enough for us to be where God is worshipped, if our hearts do not join in the worship, and go along with the minister, in all the parts of it. If he burn the incense ever so well, in the most pertinent, judicious, lively prayer, if we be not at the same time <I>praying</I> in concurrence with him, what will it avail us? (4.) All the prayers we offer up to God here in his courts are acceptable and successful only in virtue of the incense of Christ&#146;s intercession in the temple of God above. To this usage in the temple-service there seems to be an allusion (<a href="/revelation/8-1.html">Rev.&nbsp;8:1</a>, <a href="/revelation/8-3.html">Rev.&nbsp;8:3</a>, <a href="/revelation/8-4.html">Rev.&nbsp;8:4</a> ), where we find that <I>there was silence in heaven,</I> as there was in the temple, <I>for half an hour,</I> while the people were <I>silently</I> lifting up their hearts to God in prayer; and that there was an <I>angel,</I> the angel of the covenant, who offered up <I>much incense with the prayers of all saints before the throne.</I> We cannot expect an interest in Christ&#146;s intercession if we do not <I>pray,</I> and pray <I>with our spirits,</I> and continue instant in prayer. Nor can we expect that the best of our prayers should gain acceptance, and bring in an answer of peace, but through the mediation of Christ, who <I>ever </I> <I>lives, making intercession.</I> 2. How, when he was thus employed, he was <I>honoured</I> with a messenger, a special messenger sent from heaven to him (<a href="/luke/1-11.html">v.&nbsp;11</a>): <I>There appeared unto him an angel of the Lord.</I> Some observe, that we never read of an angel appearing in the temple, with a message from God, but only this one to Zacharias, because <I>there</I> God had other ways of making known his mind, as the Urim and Thummim, and by a still small voice from between the cherubim; but the ark and the oracle were wanting in the second temple, and therefore, when an express was to be sent to a priest in the temple, an angel was to be employed in it, and thereby the gospel was to be introduced, for <I>that,</I> as the <I>law,</I> was given at first very much by the <I>ministry of angels,</I> the appearance of which we often read of in the Gospels and the Acts, though the design both of the law and of the gospel, when brought to perfection, was to settle another way of correspondence, more spiritual, between God and man. This angel stood <I>on the right side of the </I> <I>altar of incense,</I> the north side of it, saith Dr. Lightfoot, on Zacharias&#146;s right hand; compare this with <a href="/zechariah/3-1.html">Zec.&nbsp;3:1</a> ,  where Satan stands at the <I>right hand</I> of Joshua the priest, to <I>resist him;</I> but Zacharias had a good angel standing <I>at his right hand,</I> to encourage him. Some think that this angel appeared coming <I>out of the most holy place,</I> which led him to stand at the right side of the altar.3. What impression this made upon Zacharias (<a href="/luke/1-12.html">v.&nbsp;12</a>): <I>When Zacharias saw him,</I> it was a surprise upon him, even to a degree of terror, for he was <I>troubled,</I> and <I>fear fell upon him,</I> <a href="/luke/1-12.html">v.&nbsp;12</a>. Though he was <I>righteous before God,</I> and <I>blameless</I> in his conversation, yet he could not be without some apprehensions at the sight of one whose visage and surrounding lustre bespoke him more than <I>human.</I> Ever since man sinned, his mind has been unable to bear the glory of such revelations and his conscience afraid of evil tidings brought by them; even Daniel himself could not bear it, <a href="/daniel/10-8.html">Dan.&nbsp;10:8</a> . And for this reason God chooses to speak to us by men like ourselves, whose <I>terror</I> shall <I>not make us afraid.</I> III. The message which the angel had to deliver to him, <a href="/luke/1-13.html">v.&nbsp;13</a>. He began his message, as angels generally did, with, <I>Fear not.</I> Perhaps it had never been Zacharias&#146;s lot to <I>burn incense</I> before; and, being a very serious conscientious man, we may suppose him full of care to do it <I>well,</I> and perhaps when he saw the angel he was afraid lest he came to rebuke him for some mistake or miscarriage; &quot;No,&#146;&#146; saith the angel, <I>&quot;fear not;</I> I have no ill tidings to bring thee from heaven. <I>Fear not,</I> but compose thyself, that thou mayest with a sedate and even spirit receive the message I have to deliver thee.&#146;&#146; Let us see what that is.1. The <I>prayers</I> he has often made shall now receive an <I>answer of peace: Fear not, </I> <I>Zacharias, for thy prayer is heard.</I> (1.) If he means his particular prayer <I>for a son</I> to build up his family, it must be the prayers he had formerly made for that mercy, when he was likely to have children; but we may suppose, now that he and his wife were both <I>well stricken in years,</I> as they had done expecting it, so they had done praying for it: like Moses, it <I>sufficeth them,</I> and they <I>speak no more to God of that matter,</I> <a href="/deuteronomy/3-26.html">Deu.&nbsp;3:26</a> . But God will now, in giving this mercy, look a great way back to the prayers that he had made long since for and with his wife, as Isaac for and with his, <a href="/genesis/25-21.html">Gen.&nbsp;25:21</a> . Note, Prayers of faith are <I>filed</I> in heaven, and are not <I>forgotten,</I> though the thing prayed for is not presently <I>given</I> in. Prayers made when we were young and coming into the world may be answered when we are old and going out of the world. But, (2.) If he means the prayers he was <I>now making,</I> and offering up with his incense, we may suppose that those were according to the duty of his place, for the Israel of God and their welfare, and the performance of the promises made to them concerning the Messiah and the coming of his kingdom: &quot;This prayer of thine is now <I>heard:</I> for thy wife shall shortly conceive him that is to be the Messiah&#146;s forerunner.&#146;&#146; Some of the Jewish writers themselves say that the priest, when he burnt incense, prayed for the <I>salvation of the whole world;</I> and now that prayer shall be heard. Or, (3.) In general, &quot;The prayers thou <I>now</I> makest, and all thy prayers, are accepted of God, and <I>come up for a memorial</I> before him&#146;&#146; (as the angel said to Cornelius, when he visited him at prayer, <a href="/acts/10-30.html">Acts.&nbsp;10:30</a>, <a href="/acts/10-31.html">Acts.&nbsp;10:31</a> ); &quot;and this shall be the sign that thou are accepted of God, Elisabeth shall <I>bear thee a son.&#146;&#146;</I> Note, it is very comfortable to praying people to know that their <I>prayers</I> are <I>heard;</I> and those mercies are doubly sweet that are given in answer to prayer.2. He shall have a son in his old age, by Elisabeth his wife, who had been long barren, that by his birth, which was <I>next</I> to miraculous, people might be prepared to receive and believe a virgin&#146;s bringing forth of a son, which was <I>perfectly</I> miraculous. He is directed what name to give his son: <I>Call him John,</I> in Hebrew <I>Johanan,</I> a name we often meet in the Old Testament: it signifies <I>gracious.</I> The priests must <I>beseech God that he will be gracious</I> (<a href="/malachi/1-9.html">Mal.&nbsp;1:9</a> ), and must so <I>bless the people,</I> <a href="/numbers/6-25.html">Num.&nbsp;6:25</a> . Zacharias was now praying thus, and the angel tells him that his prayer is heard, and he shall have a son, whom, in token of an answer to his prayer, he shall call <I>Gracious,</I> or, <I>The Lord will be gracious,</I> <a href="/isaiah/30-18.html">Isa.&nbsp;30:18</a>, <a href="/isaiah/30-19.html">Isa.&nbsp;30:19</a> .3. This son shall be the joy of his family and of all his relations, <a href="/luke/1-14.html">v.&nbsp;14</a>. He shall be another Isaac, thy laughter; and some think that is partly intended in his name, <I>John.</I> He shall be a <I>welcome child.</I> <I>Thou</I> for thy part <I>shall have joy and gladness.</I> Note, Mercies that have been long <I>waited for,</I> when they <I>come at last,</I> are the more acceptable. &quot;He shall be such a son as thou shalt have reason to rejoice in; many parents, if they could foresee what their children will prove, instead of <I>rejoicing</I> at their birth, would wish they had <I>never been;</I> but I will tell thee what thy son will be, and then thou wilt not need to <I>rejoice with trembling</I> at his birth, as the best must do, but mayest rejoice with triumph at it.&#146;&#146; Nay, and <I>many shall rejoice at his birth;</I> all the relations of the family will rejoice in it, and all its well-wishers, because it is for the honour and comfort of the family, <a href="/luke/1-58.html">v.&nbsp;58</a>. All good people will rejoice that such a religious couple as Zacharias and Elisabeth have a son, because they will give him a good education, such as, it may be hoped, will make him a public blessing to his generation. Yea, and perhaps many shall rejoice by an <I>unaccountable instinct,</I> as a presage of the joyous days the gospel will introduce.4. This son shall be a distinguished <I>favourite of Heaven,</I> and a distinguished <I>blessing to the </I> <I>earth.</I> The honour of having <I>a son</I> is nothing to the honour of having <I>such a son.</I> (1.) He shall be <I>great in the sight of the Lord;</I> those are great indeed that are so in God&#146;s sight, not those that are so in the eye of a vain and carnal world. God will <I>set him before his </I> <I>face</I> continually, will employ him in his work and send him on his errands; and that shall make him truly <I>great</I> and honourable. He shall be a <I>prophet,</I> yea <I>more than a prophet,</I> and upon that account as great as any that every were <I>born of women,</I> <a href="/matthew/11-11.html">Mt.&nbsp;11:11</a> . He shall live very much <I>retired</I> from the world, out of men&#146;s sight, and, when he makes a public appearance, it will be very <I>mean;</I> but he shall be <I>much,</I> he shall be <I>great, in the sight of the Lord.</I> (2.) He shall be a Nazarite, set apart to God from every thing that is <I>polluting;</I> in token of this, according to the law of Nazariteship, he <I>shall drink neither wine nor strong drink,</I> &#151;or, rather, neither <I>old</I> wine<I> nor new;</I> for most think that the word here translated <I>strong drink</I> signifies some sort of wine, perhaps those that we call <I>made wines,</I> or any thing that is <I>intoxicating.</I> He shall be, as Samson was by the divine precept (<a href="/judges/13-7.html">Jdg.&nbsp;13:7</a> ), and Samuel by his mother&#146;s vow (<a href="/1-samuel/1-11.html">1 Sa.&nbsp;1:11</a> ), a Nazarite for life. It is spoken of as a great instance of God&#146;s favour to his people that he <I>raised up</I> of <I>their sons for prophets,</I> and their <I>young men for </I> <I>Nazarites</I> (<a href="/amos/2-11.html">Amos.&nbsp;2:11</a> ), as if those that were designed for prophets were trained up under the discipline of the Nazarites; Samuel and John Baptist were; which intimates that those that would be <I>eminent</I> servants of God, and employed in <I>eminent</I> services, must learn to live a life of self-denial and mortification, must be dead to the pleasures of sense, and keep their minds from every thing that is darkening and disturbing to them.(3.) He shall be abundantly fitted and qualified for those great and eminent services to which in due time he shall be called: <I>He shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother&#146;s </I> <I>womb,</I> and as soon as it is possible he shall appear to have been so. Observe, [1.] Those that would be filled with the Holy Ghost must be sober and temperate, and very moderate in the use of wine and strong drink; for <I>that</I> is it that fits him for <I>this.</I> <I>Be not drunk with wine,</I> but <I>be filled </I> <I>with the Spirit,</I> with which that is not consistent, <a href="/ephesians/5-18.html">Eph.&nbsp;5:18</a> . [2.] It is possible that infants may be wrought upon by the <I>Holy Ghost,</I> even from their <I>mother&#146;s womb;</I> for John Baptist even then was <I>filled with the Holy Ghost,</I> who took possession of his heart betimes; and an early specimen was given of it, when he <I>leaped in his mother&#146;s womb for joy,</I> at the approach of the Saviour; and afterwards it appeared very early that he was <I>sanctified.</I> God had promised to <I>pour out his </I> <I>Spirit</I> upon the <I>seed</I> of believers (<a href="/isaiah/44-3.html">Isa.&nbsp;44:3</a> ), and their first <I>springing up</I> in a dedication of themselves betimes to God is the fruit of it, <a href="/luke/1-4.html">v.&nbsp;4</a>, <a href="/luke/1-5.html">v.&nbsp;5</a>. Who then can forbid water, that they should not be baptized who for aught we know (and we can say no more of the adult, witness Simon Magus) have received the Holy Ghost as well as we, and have the <I>seeds of grace</I> sown in their hearts? <a href="/acts/10-47.html">Acts.&nbsp;10:47</a> .(4.) He shall be instrumental for the conversion of many souls to God, and the preparing of them to receive and entertain the gospel of Christ, <a href="/luke/1-16.html">v.&nbsp;16</a>, <a href="/luke/1-17.html">v.&nbsp;17</a>.[1.] He shall be sent to the <I>children of Israel,</I> to the nation of the Jews, to whom the Messiah also was <I>first</I> sent, and not to the Gentiles; to the <I>whole</I> nation, and not the family of <I>the priests only,</I> with which, though he was himself of that family, we do not find he had any particular intimacy or influence.[2.] He shall go before <I>the Lord their God,</I> that is, before the Messiah, whom they must expect to be, not <I>their king,</I> in the sense wherein they commonly take it, a <I>temporal prince</I> to their nation, but <I>their Lord</I> and <I>their God,</I> to rule and defend, and serve them in a <I>spiritual</I> way by his influence on their hearts. Thomas knew this, when he said to Christ, <I>My Lord</I> and <I>my </I> <I>God,</I> better than Nathanael did, when he said, <I>Rabbi, thou are the king of Israel.</I> John shall <I>go </I> <I>before him,</I> a little before him, to give notice of his approach, and to prepare people to receive him.[3.] He shall go <I>in the spirit and power of Elias.</I> That is, <I>First,</I> He shall be such a man as Elias was, and do such work as Elias did,&#151;shall, like him, preach the necessity of repentance and reformation to a very corrupt and degenerate age,&#151;shall, like him, be bold and zealous in reproving sin and witnessing against it even in the greatest, and be hated and persecuted for it by a Herod and his Herodias, as Elijah was by an Ahab and his Jezebel. He shall be carried on in his work, as Elijah was, by a divine <I>spirit</I> and <I>power,</I> which shall crown his ministry with wonderful success. As Elias went <I>before</I> the <I>writing</I> prophets of the Old Testament, and did as it were <I>usher</I> in that <I>signal</I> period of the Old-Testament dispensation by a little <I>writing</I> of his own (<a href="/2-chronicles/21-12.html">2 Chr.&nbsp;21:12</a> ), so John Baptist went before Christ and his apostles, and introduced the gospel dispensation by preaching the substance of the gospel doctrine and duty, <I>Repent, with an eye to </I> <I>the kingdom of heaven.</I> <I>Secondly,</I> He shall be that very person who was prophesied of by Malachi under the name of Elijah (<a href="/malachi/4-5.html">Mal.&nbsp;4:5</a> ), who should be sent <I>before the coming of the day of </I> <I>the Lord.</I> Behold, I <I>send you a prophet, even Elias,</I> not Elias the Tishbite (as the Septuagint has corruptly read it, to favour the Jews&#146; traditions), but a prophet <I>in the spirit and power of Elias,</I> as the angel here expounds it.[4.] He shall <I>turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God,</I> shall incline their hearts to receive the Messiah, and bid him welcome, by awakening them to a sense of sin and a desire of righteousness. Whatever has a tendency to <I>turn us from iniquity,</I> as John&#146;s preaching and baptism had, will turn us to Christ as <I>our Lord and our God;</I> for those who through grace are wrought upon to shake off the yoke of sin, that is, the dominion of the world and the flesh, will soon be persuaded to take upon them the yoke of the <I>Lord Jesus.</I> [5.] Hereby he shall <I>turn the hearts of the fathers to the children,</I> that is, of the Jews to the Gentiles; shall help to conquer the rooted prejudices which the Jews have against the Gentiles, which was done by the gospel, as far as it prevailed, and was begun to be done by John Baptist, who came <I>for a witness, that all through him might believe,</I> who baptized and taught Roman soldiers as well as Jewish Pharisees, and who cured the pride and confidence of those Jews who gloried in their having Abraham to their father, and told them that God would <I>out of stones </I> <I>raise up children unto Abraham</I> (<a href="/matthew/3-9.html">Mt.&nbsp;3:9</a> ), which would tend to <I>cure</I> their enmity to the Gentiles. Dr. Lightfoot observes, It is the constant usage of the prophets to speak of the church of the Gentiles as children to the Jewish church, <a href="/isaiah/54-5.html">Isa.&nbsp;54:5</a>, <a href="/isaiah/54-6.html">Isa.&nbsp;54:6</a>, <a href="/isaiah/54-13.html">Isa.&nbsp;54:13</a> <a href="/isaiah/60-4.html">Isa.&nbsp;60:4</a>, <a href="/isaiah/60-9.html">Isa.&nbsp;60:9</a> <a href="/isaiah/62-5.html">Isa.&nbsp;62:5</a> <a href="/isaiah/66-12.html">Isa.&nbsp;66:12</a> . When the Jews that embraced the faith of Christ were brought to join in communion with the Gentiles that did so too, then the heart of the fathers was turned to the children. And he shall <I>turn </I> <I>the disobedient to the wisdom of the just,</I> that is, he shall introduce the gospel, by which the Gentiles, who are now <I>disobedient,</I> shall be turned, no so much to their fathers the Jews, but to the faith of Christ, here called the <I>wisdom of the just,</I> in communion with the believing Jews; or thus, He shall <I>turn the hearts of the fathers with the children,</I> that is, the hearts of old and young, shall be instrumental to bring some of every age to be <I>religious,</I> to work a great reformation in the Jewish nation, to bring them <I>off from</I> a ritual traditional religion which that had rested in, and to bring them up to <I>substantial serious</I> godliness: and the effect of this will be, that enmities will be slain and discord made to cease; and they are at variance, being united in his baptism, will be better reconciled one to another. This agrees with the account Josephus gives of John Baptist, <I>Antiq.</I> 18.117-118. &quot;That he was a good man, and taught the Jews the exercise of virtue, in piety towards God, and righteous towards one another, and that they should convene and knit together in baptism.&#146;&#146; And he saith, &quot;The people flocked after him, and were exceedingly delighted in his doctrine.&#146;&#146; Thus he turned the hearts of fathers and children to God and to one another, by <I>turning the disobedient to the wisdom of the just.</I> Observe, <I>First,</I> True religion is <I>the </I> <I>wisdom of just men,</I> in distinction from the <I>wisdom of the world.</I> It is both our wisdom and our duty to be religious; there is both equity and prudence in it. <I>Secondly,</I> It is not possible but that those who have been unbelieving and <I>disobedient</I> may be turned to the <I>wisdom of the just;</I> divine grace can conquer the greatest ignorance and prejudice. <I>Thirdly,</I> The great design of the gospel is to bring people <I>home</I> to God, and to bring them nearer to <I>one another;</I> and on this errand John Baptist is sent. In the mention that is <I>twice</I> made of his <I>turning</I> people, there seems to be an allusion to the name of the Tishbite, which is given to Elijah, which, some think, does not denote the country or city he was of, but has an appellative signification, and therefore the render it Elijah the <I>converter,</I> one that was much employed, and very successful, in <I>conversion-work.</I> The Elias of the New Testament is therefore said to <I>turn</I> or <I>convert</I> many to the Lord their God.[6.] Hereby he shall <I>make ready a people prepared for the Lord,</I> shall dispose the minds of people to receive the doctrine of Christ, that thereby they may be <I>prepared</I> for the comforts of his coming. Note, <I>First,</I> All that are to be <I>devoted</I> to the Lord, and <I>made happy</I> in him, must first be <I>prepared</I> and <I>made ready</I> for him. We must be prepared by grace in this world for the glory in the other, by the terrors of the law for the comforts of the gospel, by the spirit of bondage for the Spirit of adoption. <I>Secondly,</I> Nothing has a more direct tendency to prepare people for Christ than the doctrine of repentance received and submitted to. When sin is thereby made grievous, Christ will become very precious.IV. Zacharias&#146;s unbelief of the angel&#146;s prediction, and the rebuke he was laid under for that unbelief. He heard all that the angel had to say, and should have bowed his head, and worshipped the Lord, saying, <I>Be it unto thy servant according to the word</I> which thou hast spoken; but it was not so. We are here told,1. What his unbelief spoke, <a href="/luke/1-18.html">v.&nbsp;18</a>. He said to the angel, <I>Whereby shall I know this?</I> This was not a humble petition for the confirming of his faith, but a peevish objection against what was said to him as altogether incredible; as if he should say, &quot;I can never be made to believe this.&#146;&#146; He could not but perceive that it was <I>an angel</I> that spoke to him; the message delivered, having reference to the Old-Testament prophecies, carried much of its own evidence along with it. There are many instances in the Old Testament of those that had children when they were old, yet he cannot believe that he shall have this child of promise: <I>&quot;For I am an old man,</I> and my wife hath not only been all her days barren, but is now well <I>stricken in years,</I> and not likely ever to have children.&#146;&#146; Therefore he must have a <I>sign</I> given him, or he will not believe. Though the appearance of an angel, which had long been disused in the church, was sign enough,&#151;though he had this notice given him in the temple, the place of God&#146;s oracles, where he had reason to think no evil angel would be permitted to come,&#151;though it was given him when he was praying, and burning incense,&#151;and though a firm belief of that great principle of religion that God has an almighty power, and with him <I>nothing is impossible,</I> which we ought not only to <I>know,</I> but to teach others, was enough to silence all objections,&#151;yet, considering his own body and his wife&#146;s too much, unlike a son of Abraham, he <I>staggered at the </I> <I>promise,</I> <a href="/romans/4-19.html">Rom.&nbsp;4:19</a>, <a href="/romans/4-20.html">Rom.&nbsp;4:20</a> .2. How his unbelief was <I>silenced,</I> and he <I>silenced</I> for it.(1.) The angel <I>stops his mouth,</I> by <I>asserting</I> his authority. Doth he ask, <I>Whereby shall I </I> <I>know this?</I> Let him know it by this, <I>I am Gabriel,</I> <a href="/luke/1-19.html">v.&nbsp;19</a>. He puts his name to his prophecy, doth as it were sign it with his own hand, <I>teste meipso&#151;take my word for it.</I> Angels have sometimes refused to tell their names, as to Manoah and his wife; but his angel readily saith, <I>I am Gabriel,</I> which signifies <I>the power of God,</I> or the <I>mighty one of God,</I> intimating that the God who bade him say this was able to make it good. He also makes himself known by this name to put him in mind of the notices of the Messiah&#146;s coming sent to Daniel by the <I>man Gabriel,</I> <a href="/daniel/8-16.html">Dan.&nbsp;8:16</a> <a href="/daniel/9-21.html">Dan.&nbsp;9:21</a> . <I>&quot;I am the same</I> that was sent then, and am sent now in pursuance of the same intention.&#146;&#146; He is Gabriel, who <I>stands in the presence of God,</I> an immediate attendant upon the throne of God. The prime ministers of state in the Persian court are described by this, that they <I>saw the king&#146;s </I> <I>face,</I> <a href="/esther/1-14.html">Esth.&nbsp;1:14</a> . &quot;Though I am now talking with thee here, yet <I>I stand in the presence of God.</I> I know his eye is upon me, and I dare not say any more than I have warrant to say. But I declare <I>I am sent to speak to thee,</I> sent on purpose to <I>show thee these glad tidings,</I> which, being so well worthy of all acceptation, thou oughtest to have received cheerfully.&#146;&#146;(2.) The angel <I>stops his mouth</I> indeed, by <I>exerting his power:</I> &quot;That thou mayest object no more, <I>behold thou shalt be dumb,</I> <a href="/luke/1-20.html">v.&nbsp;20</a>. If thou wilt have a sign for the support of thy faith, it shall be such a one as shall be also the punishment of thine unbelief; thou <I>shalt not be able to </I> <I>speak till the day that these things shall be performed,&#146;&#146;</I> <a href="/luke/1-20.html">v.&nbsp;20</a>. Thou shalt be both <I>dumb</I> and <I>deaf;</I> the same word signifies both, and it is plain that he lost his hearing as well as his speech, for his friends <I>made signs</I> to him (<a href="/luke/1-62.html">v.&nbsp;62</a>), as well as he to them, <a href="/luke/1-22.html">v.&nbsp;22</a>. Now, in striking him dumb, [1.] God dealt <I>justly</I> with him, because he had objected against God&#146;s word. Hence we may take occasion to admire the patience of God and his forbearance toward us, that we, who have often spoken to his dishonour, have not been struck dumb, as Zacharias was, and as we had been if God had dealt with us according to our sins. [2.] God dealt <I>kindly</I> with him, and very tenderly and graciously. For, <I>First,</I> Thus he prevented his speaking any more such distrustful unbelieving words. If he has <I>thought evil,</I> and will not himself <I>lay his hands upon his </I> <I>mouth,</I> nor keep it as with a bridle, God will. It is better not to speak at all than to <I>speak </I> <I>wickedly.</I> <I>Secondly,</I> Thus he <I>confirmed</I> his faith; and, by his being disabled to <I>speak,</I> he is enabled to <I>think</I> the better. If by the rebukes we are under for our sin we be brought to give more credit to the word of God, we have no reason to complain of them. <I>Thirdly,</I> Thus he was kept from divulging the vision, and boasting of it, which otherwise he would have been apt to do, whereas it was designed for the present to be lodged as a secret with him. <I>Fourthly,</I> It was a great mercy that God&#146;s words should be fulfilled in their season, notwithstanding his sinful distrust. The <I>unbelief of man</I> shall not <I>make the promises of God of no effect,</I> they shall be <I>fulfilled in their season,</I> and he shall not be for ever <I>dumb,</I> but only <I>till the day that these </I> <I>things shall be performed,</I> and then thy <I>lips</I> shall be <I>opened,</I> that thy <I>mouth</I> may <I>show forth </I> <I>God&#146;s praise.</I> Thus, though God <I>chastens</I> the <I>iniquity</I> of his people <I>with the rod,</I> yet his <I>loving </I> <I>kindness</I> he <I>will not take away.</I> V. The return of Zacharias to the people, and at length to his family, and the conception of this child of promise, the son of his old age.1. The people staid, expecting Zacharias to come out of the temple, because he was to pronounce the blessing upon them in the name of the Lord; and, though he staid beyond the usual time, yet they did not, as is too common in Christian congregations, hurry away without the blessing, but <I>waited</I> for him, marvelling that he <I>tarried so long in the temple,</I> and afraid let something was amiss, <a href="/luke/1-21.html">v.&nbsp;21</a>.2. When he came out, he was <I>speechless,</I> <a href="/luke/1-22.html">v.&nbsp;22</a>. He was now to have dismissed the congregation with a blessing, but was dumb and not able to do it, that the people may be minded to expect the Messiah, who can <I>command</I> the blessing, who <I>blesseth indeed,</I> and in whom all <I>the nations of the earth are blessed.</I> Aaron&#146;s priesthood is now shortly to be <I>silenced</I> and <I>set aside,</I> to make way for the <I>bringing in</I> of a <I>better hope.</I> 3. He made a shift to give them to understand that he had <I>seen a vision,</I> by some awful signs he made, for he <I>beckoned to them,</I> and <I>remained speechless,</I> <a href="/luke/1-22.html">v.&nbsp;22</a>. This represents to us the weakness and deficiency of the Levitical priesthood, in comparison with Christ&#146;s priesthood and the dispensation of the gospel. The Old Testament speaks by signs, gives us some intimations of divine and heavenly things, but <I>imperfect</I> and uncertain; it <I>beckons to us,</I> but <I>remains </I> <I>speechless.</I> It is the gospel that speaks to us articulately, and gives us a clear view of that which the Old Testament was seen <I>through a glass darkly.</I> 4. He staid out the <I>days of his ministration;</I> for, his lot being to <I>burn incense,</I> he could do that, though he was <I>dumb</I> and <I>deaf.</I> When we cannot perform the service of God so well as we would, yet, if we perform it as well as we can, God will accept of us in it.</p><p><a name="Lu1_26"></a><a name="Lu1_27"></a><a name="Lu1_28"></a><a name="Lu1_29"></a><a name="Lu1_30"></a><a name="Lu1_31"></a><a name="Lu1_32"></a><a name="Lu1_33"></a><a name="Lu1_34"></a><a name="Lu1_35"></a><a name="Lu1_36"></a><a name="Lu1_37"></a><a name="Lu1_38"></a> <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Luke+1:26-38">Verses 26-38</a> We have here notice given us of all that it was fit we should know concerning the incarnation and conception of our blessed Saviour, six months after the conception of John. The same angel, Gabriel, that was employed in making known to Zacharias God&#146;s purpose concerning <I>his son,</I> is employed in this also; for in this, the same glorious work of redemption, which was <I>begun</I> in that, is <I>carried on.</I> As bad angels are none of the redeemed, so good angels are none of the redeemers; yet they are employed by the Redeemer as his messengers, and they go cheerfully on his errands, because they are his Father&#146;s humble servants, and his children&#146;s hearty friends and well-wishers.I. We have here an account given of the mother of our Lord, of whom he was to be born, whom, though we are not to pray to, yet we ought to praise God for.1. Her name was <I>Mary,</I> the same name with <I>Miriam,</I> the sister of Moses and Aaron; the name signifies <I>exalted,</I> and a great elevation it was to her indeed to be thus <I>favoured</I> above all the daughters of the house of David.2. She was a daughter of the royal family, lineally descended from David, and she herself and all her friends knew it, for she went under the title and character of the <I>house of David,</I> though she was poor and low in the world; and she was enabled by God&#146;s providence, and the care of the Jews, to preserve their genealogies, to <I>make it out,</I> and as long as the promise of the Messiah was to be fulfilled it was <I>worth keeping;</I> but for those now, who are brought low in the world, to have descended from persons of honour, is not worth mentioning.3. She was <I>a virgin,</I> a pure unspotted one, but <I>espoused</I> to one of the same royal stock, like her, however, of low estate; so that upon both accounts there was (as it was fit there should be) an equality between them; his name was Joseph; he also was <I>of the house of David,</I> <a href="/matthew/1-20.html">Mt.&nbsp;1:20</a> . Christ&#146;s mother was a <I>virgin,</I> because he was not to be born by ordinary generation, but miraculously; it was necessary that he should be so, that, though he must partake of the nature of man, yet not of the corruption of that nature: but he was born of a <I>virgin espoused,</I> made up to be married, and contracted, to put honour upon the married state, that that might not be brought into contempt (which was an ordinance in innocency) by the Redeemer&#146;s being born of a virgin.4. She lived in Nazareth, a <I>city of Galilee,</I> a remote corner of the country, and in no reputation for religion or learning, but which bordered upon the heathen, and therefore was called <I>Galilee of the Gentiles.</I> Christ&#146;s having his relations resident there intimates favour in reserve for the Gentile world. And Dr. Lightfoot observes that Jonah was by birth a Galilean, and Elijah and Elisha very much conversant in Galilee, who were all famous <I>prophets of the </I> <I>Gentiles.</I> The angel was sent to her from Nazareth. Note, No distance or disadvantage of place shall be a prejudice to those for whom God has favours in store. The angel Gabriel carries his message as cheerfully to Mary and Nazareth in Galilee as to Zacharias in the temple at Jerusalem.II. The <I>address</I> of the angel to her, <a href="/luke/1-28.html">v.&nbsp;28</a>. We are not told what she was doing, or how employed, when the angel came <I>unto her;</I> but he surprised her with this salutation, <I>Hail, thou art </I> <I>highly favoured.</I> This was intended to raise in her, 1. A value for <I>herself;</I> and, though it is very rare that any need to have any sparks struck into their breast with such design, yet in some, who like Mary pore only on their <I>low estate,</I> there is occasion for it. 2. An expectation of great news, not from abroad, but from above. Heaven designs, no doubt, uncommon favours for one whom an angel makes court to with such respect, <I>Hail thou,</I> <I>chaire</I> &#151;<I>rejoice thou;</I> it was the usual form of salutation; it expresses an esteem of her, and good-will to her and her prosperity.(1.) She is dignified: &quot;Thou art <I>highly favoured.</I> God, in his choice of thee to be the mother of the Messiah, has put an honour upon thee peculiar to thyself, above that of Eve, who was the mother of <I>all living.&#146;&#146;</I> The vulgar Latin translates this <I>grati&acirc; plena&#151;full of grace,</I> and thence gathers that she had more of the inherent graces of the Spirit than ever any had; whereas it is certain that this bespeaks no other than the singular favour done her in preferring her to conceive and bear our blessed Lord, an honour which, since he was to be the <I>seed of the </I> <I>woman,</I> some woman must have, not for <I>personal merit,</I> but purely for the sake of <I>free grace,</I> and she is pitched upon. <I>Even so, Father, because it seemed good unto thee.</I> (2.) She has the presence of God with her: <I>&quot;The Lord is with thee,</I> though poor and mean, and perhaps now forecasting how to get a livelihood and maintain a family in the married state.&#146;&#146; The angel with this word raised the faith of Gideon (<a href="/judges/6-12.html">Jdg.&nbsp;6:12</a> ): <I>The Lord is with thee.</I> Nothing is to be despaired of, not the performance of any service, not the obtaining of any favour, though ever so great, if we have <I>God with us.</I> This word might put her in mind of the Immanuel, <I>God with us,</I> which a virgin shall <I>conceive</I> and <I>bear</I> (<a href="/isaiah/7-14.html">Isa.&nbsp;7:14</a> ), and why not she?(3.) She has the blessing of God upon her: <I>&quot;Blessed art thou among women;</I> not only thou shalt be accounted so by men, but thou shalt be so. Thou that art so <I>highly favoured</I> in this instance mayest expect in other things to be <I>blessed.&#146;&#146;</I> She explains this herself (<a href="/luke/1-48.html">v.&nbsp;48</a>), <I>All </I> <I>generations shall call me blessed.</I> Compare it with that which Deborah saith of Jael, another that was the glory of her sex (<a href="/judges/5-24.html">Jdg.&nbsp;5:24</a> ), <I>Blessed shall she be above women in the tent.</I> III. The consternation she was in, upon this address (<a href="/luke/1-29.html">v.&nbsp;29</a>). <I>When she saw him,</I> and the glories with which he was surrounded, she was <I>troubled</I> at the sight of him, and much more <I>at </I> <I>his saying.</I> Had she been a proud ambitious young woman, that aimed high, and flattered herself with the expectation of great things in the world, she would have been <I>pleased</I> at his saying, would have been puffed up with it, and (as we have reason to think she was a young woman of very good sense) would have had an answer ready, signifying so much: but, instead of that, she is <I>confounded</I> at it, as not conscious to herself of any thing that either <I>merited</I> or <I>promised</I> such great things; and she <I>cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.</I> Was it from heaven or of men? Was it to amuse her? was it to ensnare her? was it to banter her? or was there something substantial and weighty in it? But, of all the thoughts she had as to <I>what manner </I> <I>of salutation it should be,</I> I believe she had not the least idea of its being ever intended or used for a prayer, as it is, and has been, for many ages, by the corrupt, degenerate, and anti-christian ages of the church, and to be ten times repeated for the Lord&#146;s prayer once; so it is in the church of Rome. But her thoughtfulness upon this occasion gives a very useful intimation to young people of her sex, when addresses are made to them, to consider and <I>cast in their minds</I> what manner of <I>salutations</I> they are, whence they come, and what their tendency is, that they may receive them accordingly, and may always <I>stand on their guard.</I> IV. The message itself which the angel had to deliver to her. Some time the angel gives her to <I>pause;</I> but, observing that this did but increase her perplexity, he went on with his errand, <a href="/luke/1-30.html">v.&nbsp;30</a>. To what he had said she made no reply; he therefore confirms it: <I>&quot;Fear not, Mary,</I> I have no other design than to assure thee that <I>thou hast found favour with God</I> more than thou thinkest of, as there are many who think they are more favoured with God than they really are.&#146;&#146; Note, Those that have <I>found favour with God</I> should not give way to disquieting distrustful fears. Doth God favour thee? Fear not, though the world frown upon thee. Is he for thee? No matter who is against thee.1. Though she is a <I>virgin,</I> she shall have the honour of being a <I>mother:</I> <I>&quot;Thou shalt conceive </I> <I>in thy womb, and bring forth a son,</I> and thou shalt have the naming of him; thou shalt <I>call his </I> <I>name Jesus,&#146;&#146;</I> <a href="/luke/1-31.html">v.&nbsp;31</a>. It was the sentence upon Eve, that, though she should have the honour to be the <I>mother of all living,</I> yet this mortification shall be an allay to that honour, that <I>her desire </I> <I>shall be to her husband,</I> and he <I>shall rule over her,</I> <a href="/genesis/3-16.html">Gen.&nbsp;3:16</a> . But Mary has the honour without the allay.2. Though she lives in <I>poverty</I> and <I>obscurity,</I> yet she shall have the honour to be the mother of the Messiah; her son shall be named <I>Jesus&#151;a Saviour,</I> such a one as the world <I>needs,</I> rather than such one as the Jews <I>expect.</I> (1.) He will be very <I>nearly allied</I> to the <I>upper world.</I> He <I>shall be great,</I> truly great, incontestably great; for he shall be called <I>the Son of the Highest,</I> the Son of God who is <I>the </I> <I>Highest;</I> of the same nature, as the son is of the same nature with the father; and very dear to him, as the son is to the father. He shall be <I>called,</I> and not <I>miscalled,</I> the <I>Son of the Highest;</I> for he is himself <I>God over all, blessed for evermore,</I> <a href="/romans/9-5.html">Rom.&nbsp;9:5</a> . Note, Those who are the children of God, though but by adoption and regeneration, are <I>truly great,</I> and therefore are concerned to be <I>very good,</I> <a href="/1-john/3-1.html">1 Jn.&nbsp;3:1</a>, <a href="/1-john/3-2.html">1 Jn.&nbsp;3:2</a> .(2.) He will be very <I>highly preferred</I> in the <I>lower world;</I> for, though born under the most disadvantageous circumstances possible, and appearing in the form of a servant, yet <I>the Lord </I> <I>God shall give unto him the throne of his father David,</I> <a href="/luke/1-32.html">v.&nbsp;32</a>. He puts her in mind that she was <I>of the house of David;</I> and that therefore, since neither the <I>Salique law,</I> nor the right of primogeniture, took place in the entail of his throne, it was not impossible but that she might bring forth an heir to it, and therefore might the more easily <I>believe</I> it when she was told by an angel from heaven that she <I>should</I> do so, that after the sceptre had been long <I>departed</I> from that ancient and honourable family it should now at length return to it again, to remain in it, not by succession, but in the same hand to eternity. His people will not <I>give him that throne,</I> will not acknowledge his right to <I>rule them;</I> but the <I>Lord God</I> shall give him a right to <I>rule them,</I> and set him as <I>his king</I> upon the <I>holy hill of Zion.</I> He assures her, [1.] That his kingdom shall be <I>spiritual:</I> he shall <I>reign over the house of Jacob,</I> not <I>Israel according to the flesh,</I> for they neither came into his interests nor did they continue long a people; it must therefore be a <I>spiritual</I> kingdom, the house of Israel <I>according to the promise,</I> that he must <I>rule over.</I> [2.] That it shall be eternal: he shall reign <I>for ever,</I> and <I>of his kingdom there shall be no end,</I> as there had been long since of the temporal reign of David&#146;s house, and would shortly be of the state of Israel. Other crowns endure not <I>to every generation,</I> but Christ&#146;s doth, <a href="/proverbs/27-24.html">Prov.&nbsp;27:24</a> . The gospel is the <I>last</I> dispensation, we are to look for no other.V. The further information given her, upon her enquiry concerning the birth of this prince.1. It is a just enquiry which she makes: <I>&quot;How shall this be?</I> <a href="/luke/1-34.html">v.&nbsp;34</a>. How can I now presently conceive a child&#146;&#146; (for so the angel meant) &quot;when I <I>know not a man;</I> must it therefore be otherwise than by ordinary generation? If so, let me now <I>how?&#146;&#146;</I> She knew that the Messiah must be born of <I>a virgin;</I> and, if she must be his mother, she desires to know how. This was not the language of her distrust, or any doubt of what the angel said, but of a desire to be further instructed.2. It is a satisfactory answer that is given to it, <a href="/luke/1-35.html">v.&nbsp;35</a>. (1.) She shall conceive by <I>the power </I> <I>of the Holy Ghost,</I> whose proper work and office is to <I>sanctify,</I> and therefore to sanctify the virgin for this purpose. The Holy Ghost is called the <I>power of the Highest.</I> Doth she ask how this shall be? This is enough to help her over all the difficulty there appears in it; a divine power will undertake it, not the power of an angel employed in it, as in other works of wonder, but the power of <I>the Holy Ghost</I> himself.(2.) She must <I>ask no questions</I> concerning the way and manner how it shall be wrought; for the Holy Ghost, as the <I>power of the Highest,</I> shall <I>overshadow</I> her, as the <I>cloud</I> covered the tabernacle when the glory of God took possession of it, to conceal it from those that would too curiously observe the motions of it, and pry into the mystery of it. The formation of every babe in the womb, and the entrance of the spirit of life into it, is a mystery in nature; none knows <I>the </I> <I>way of the spirit, nor how the bones are formed in the womb of her that is with child,</I> <a href="/ecclesiastes/11-5.html">Eccl.&nbsp;11:5</a> . We were <I>made in secret,</I> <a href="/psalms/139-15.html">Ps.&nbsp;139:15</a>, <a href="/psalms/139-16.html">Ps.&nbsp;139:16</a> . Much more was the formation of the child Jesus a <I>mystery;</I> without controversy, <I>great was the mystery of godliness, God manifest in the </I> <I>flesh,</I> <a href="/1-timothy/3-16.html">1 Tim.&nbsp;3:16</a> . It is a <I>new thing created in the earth</I> (<a href="/jeremiah/31-22.html">Jer.&nbsp;31:22</a> ), concerning which we must not covet to be <I>wise above what is written.</I> (3.) The child she shall conceive is a <I>holy thing,</I> and therefore must not be conceived by <I>ordinary generation,</I> because he must not share in the common corruption and pollution of the human nature. He is spoken of emphatically, <I>That Holy Thing,</I> such as never was; and he shall be called <I>the Son of God,</I> as the Son of the Father by eternal generation, as an indication of which he shall now be formed by the Holy Ghost in the present conception. His human nature must be so produced, as it was fit that should be which was to be taken into union with the divine nature.3. It was a further encouragement to her faith to be told that <I>her cousin Elisabeth,</I> though stricken in years, was <I>with child,</I> <a href="/luke/1-36.html">v.&nbsp;36</a>. Here is an age of wonders beginning, and therefore be not surprised: here is one among thy own relations truly great, though not altogether so great as this; it is usual with God to advance in working wonders. <I>Greater works than these shall ye do.</I> Though Elisabeth was, on the father&#146;s side, of the <I>daughters of Aaron</I> (<a href="/luke/1-5.html">v.&nbsp;5</a>), yet on the mother&#146;s side she might be of the house of David, for those two families often intermarried, as an earnest of the uniting of the royalty and the priesthood of the Messiah. <I>This is the sixth month with her </I> <I>that was called barren.</I> This intimates, as Dr. Lightfoot thinks, that all the instances in the Old Testament of those having children that had been long barren, which was above nature, were designed to prepare the world for the belief of a virgin&#146;s bearing a son, which was against nature. And therefore, even in the birth of Isaac, Abraham saw Christ&#146;s day, foresaw such a miracle in the birth of Christ. The angel assures Mary of this, to encourage her faith, and concludes with that great truth, of undoubted certainty and universal use, <I>For with God nothing </I> <I>shall be impossible</I> (<a href="/luke/1-37.html">v.&nbsp;37</a>), and, if nothing, then not this. Abraham therefore staggered not at the belief of the divine promise, because he was strong in his belief of the divine power, <a href="/romans/4-20.html">Rom.&nbsp;4:20</a>, <a href="/romans/4-21.html">Rom.&nbsp;4:21</a> . No <I>word</I> of God must be <I>incredible to us,</I> as long as no <I>work</I> of God is <I>impossible to him.</I> VI. Her acquiescence in the will of God concerning her, <a href="/luke/1-38.html">v.&nbsp;38</a>. She owns herself, 1. A believing subject to the divine authority: <I>&quot;Behold, the handmaid of the Lord.</I> Lord, I am at thy service, at thy disposal, to do what thou commandest me.&#146;&#146; She objects not the danger of spoiling her marriage, and blemishing her reputation, but leaves the issue with God, and submits entirely to his will. 2. A believing expectant of the divine favour. She is not only content that it should be so, but humbly desires that it may be so: <I>Be it unto me according to thy word.</I> Such a favour as this it was not for her to slight, or be indifferent to; and for what God has <I>promised</I> he will be <I>sought unto;</I> by prayer we must put our <I>amen,</I> or <I>so be it,</I> to the promise. <I>Remember,</I> and perform <I>thy word unto thy servant, upon which thou has caused me to hope.</I> We must, as Mary here, <I>guide</I> our desires by the word of God, and <I>ground</I> our hopes <I>upon</I> it. Be it unto me <I>according to thy word;</I> just so, and no otherwise.Hereupon, <I>the angel departed from her;</I> having completed the errand he was sent upon, he returned, to give an account of it, and receive new instructions. Converse with angels was always a transient thing, and soon over; it will be constant and permanent in the future state. It is generally supposed that just at this instant the virgin <I>conceived,</I> by the <I>overshadowing power</I> of the Holy Ghost: but, the scripture being decently silent concerning it, it doth not become us to be <I>inquisitive,</I> much less <I>positive.</I> </p></span><div class="Global-Page-Links"><a class="Previous" href="/commentaries/matthew-henry-complete/luke/1.html">Prev</a><div class="GlobalPageLinksContainer"><ul><a name="PageLink-1" class="PageLink-1 active" href="/commentaries/matthew-henry-complete/luke/1.html" >1</a><a name="PageLink-2" class="PageLink-2 " href="/commentaries/matthew-henry-complete/luke/1.html?p=2" >2</a></ul>
