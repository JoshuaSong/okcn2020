		<span id="Page-1" style=""><b><a href="/john/6.html">Chapter&nbsp;6</a></b><P>In this chapter we have, <I>I. The miracle of the loaves (<a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=john+6:1-14">v.&nbsp;1-14</a>). II. Christ&#146;s walking upon the water (<a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=john+6:15-21">v.&nbsp;15-21</a>). III. The people&#146;s flocking after him to Capernaum (<a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=john+6:22-25">v.&nbsp;22-25</a>). IV. His conference with them, occasioned by the miracle of the loaves, in which he reproves them for seeking carnal food, and directs them to spiritual food (<a href="/john/6-26.html">v.&nbsp;26</a>, <a href="/john/6-27.html">v.&nbsp;27</a>), showing them how they must labour for spiritual food (<a href="/john/6-28.html">v.&nbsp;28</a>, <a href="/john/6-29.html">v.&nbsp;29</a>), and what that spiritual food is (<a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=john+6:30-59">v.&nbsp;30-59</a>). V. Their discontent at what he said, and the reproof he gave them for it (<a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=john+6:60-65">v.&nbsp;60-65</a>). VI. The apostasy of many from him, and his discourse with his disciples that adhered to him upon that occasion (<a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=john+6:66-71">v.&nbsp;66-71</a>).</I></p><p><a name="Joh6_1"></a><a name="Joh6_2"></a><a name="Joh6_3"></a><a name="Joh6_4"></a><a name="Joh6_5"></a><a name="Joh6_6"></a><a name="Joh6_7"></a><a name="Joh6_8"></a><a name="Joh6_9"></a><a name="Joh6_10"></a><a name="Joh6_11"></a><a name="Joh6_12"></a><a name="Joh6_13"></a><a name="Joh6_14"></a> <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=John+6:1-14">Verses 1-14</a> We have here an account of Christ&#146;s feeding five thousand men with five loaves and two fishes, which miracle is in <I>this</I> respect remarkable, that it is the only passage of the actions of <I>Christ&#146;s life</I> that is recorded by all the four evangelists. John, who does not usually relate what had been recorded by those who wrote before him, yet relates this, because of the reference the following discourse has to it. Observe,I. The <I>place</I> and <I>time</I> where and when this miracle was wrought, which are noted for the greater evidence of the truth of the story; it is not said that it was done once upon a time, nobody knows where, but the circumstances are specified, that the fact might be enquired into.1. The country that Christ was in (<a href="/john/6-1.html">v.&nbsp;1</a>): <I>He went over the sea of Galilee,</I> called elsewhere <I>the lake of Gennesareth,</I> here <I>the sea of Tiberias,</I> from a city adjoining, which Herod had lately enlarged and beautified, and called so in honour of Tiberius the emperor, and probably had made his metropolis. Christ did not go directly over cross this inland sea, but made a <I>coasting</I> voyage to another place on the same side. It is not tempting God to choose to go <I>by </I> <I>water,</I> when there is convenience for it, even to those places whither we might go <I>by land;</I> for Christ never <I>tempted the Lord his God,</I> <a href="/matthew/4-7.html">Mt.&nbsp;4:7</a> .2. The company that he was attended with: <I>A great multitude followed him, because they </I> <I>saw his miracles,</I> <a href="/john/6-2.html">v.&nbsp;2</a>. Note, (1.) Our Lord Jesus, while he went about <I>doing good,</I> lived continually in <I>a crowd,</I> which gave him more trouble than honour. Good and useful men must not complain of a <I>hurry</I> of business, when they are serving God and their generation; it will be time enough to <I>enjoy ourselves</I> when we come to that world where we shall <I>enjoy God.</I> (2.) Christ&#146;s miracles drew many <I>after him</I> that were not effectually drawn <I>to him.</I> They had their curiosity gratified by the strangeness of them, who had not their consciences convinced by the power of them.3. Christ&#146;s posting himself advantageously to entertain them (<a href="/john/6-3.html">v.&nbsp;3</a>): <I>He went up into a </I> <I>mountain,</I> and there he <I>sat with his disciples,</I> that he might the more conveniently be seen and heard by the multitude that crowded after him; this was a <I>natural</I> pulpit, and not, like Ezra&#146;s, made <I>for the purpose.</I> Christ was now driven to be a <I>field preacher;</I> but his word was never the worse, nor the less acceptable, for that, to those who knew how to value it, who followed him still, not only when he <I>went out</I> to a desert place, but when he <I>went up</I> to a mountain, though <I>up-hill</I> be <I>against heart.</I> He <I>sat</I> there, as teachers do <I>in cathedra&#151;in the chair of instruction.</I> He did not sit at ease, not sit in state, yet he sat as one having authority, sat ready to receive addresses that were made to him; whoever would might come, and find him there. He sat <I>with </I> <I>his disciples;</I> he condescended to take them to <I>sit with him,</I> to put a reputation upon them before the people, and give them an earnest of the glory in which they should shortly sit with him. We are said to <I>sit with him,</I> <a href="/ephesians/2-6.html">Eph.&nbsp;2:6</a> .4. The time when it was. The first words, <I>After those things,</I> do not signify that this immediately followed what was related in the foregoing chapter, for it was a considerable time after, and they signify no more than in process of time; but we are told (<a href="/john/6-4.html">v.&nbsp;4</a>) that it was <I>when </I> <I>the passover was nigh,</I> which is here noted, (1.) Because, perhaps, that had brought in all the apostles from their respective expeditions, whither they were sent as itinerant preachers, that they might attend their Master to Jerusalem, to keep the feast. (2.) Because it was a custom with the Jews religiously to observe the approach of the passover <I>thirty days</I> before, with some sort of solemnity; so long before they had it in their eye, repaired the roads, mended bridges, if there was occasion, and discoursed of the passover and the institution of it. (3.) Because, perhaps, the approach of the passover, when every one knew Christ would go up to Jerusalem, and be absent for some time, made the multitude flock the more after him and attend the more diligently on him. Note, The prospect of losing our opportunities should quicken us to improve them with double diligence; and, when solemn ordinances are approaching, it is good to prepare for them by conversing with the word of Christ.II. The miracle itself. And here observe,1. The notice Christ took of the crowd that attended him (<a href="/john/6-5.html">v.&nbsp;5</a>): He <I>lifted up his eyes,</I> and <I>saw a great company come to him,</I> poor, mean, ordinary people, no doubt, for such make up the multitudes, especially in such remote corners of the country; yet Christ showed himself pleased with their attendance, and concerned for their welfare, to teach us to <I>condescend to </I> <I>those of low estate,</I> and not to <I>set</I> those <I>with the dogs of our flock</I> whom Christ hath set with the lambs of his. The souls of the poor are as precious to Christ, and should be so to us, as those of the rich.2. The enquiry he made concerning the way of providing for them. He directed himself to Philip, who had been his disciple from the first, and had seen all his miracles, and particularly that of his turning water into wine, and therefore it might be expected that he should have said, &quot;Lord, if thou wilt, it is easy to thee to feed them all.&#146;&#146; Those that, like Israel, have been witnesses of Christ&#146;s works, and have shared in the benefit of them, are inexcusable if they say, <I>Can he furnish a table in the wilderness?</I> Philip was of Bethsaida, in the neighbourhood of which town Christ now was, and therefore he was most likely to help them to provision at the best hand; and probably much of the company was known to him, and he was concerned for them. Now Christ asked, <I>Whence shall we buy bread, that these</I> may eat? (1.) He takes it for granted that they must all <I>eat with him.</I> One would think that when he had taught and healed them he had done his part; and that now they should rather have been contriving how to treat him and his disciples, for some of the people were probably <I>rich,</I> and we are sure that Christ and his disciples were <I>poor;</I> yet he is solicitous to entertain them. Those that will accept Christ&#146;s spiritual gifts, instead of <I>paying</I> for them, shall be <I>paid</I> for their acceptance of them. Christ, having fed their souls with the bread of life, feeds their bodies also with <I>food convenient,</I> to show that the Lord is for the body, and to encourage us to pray for our daily bread, and to set us an example of compassion to the poor, <a href="/james/2-15.html">James.&nbsp;2:15</a>, <a href="/james/2-16.html">James.&nbsp;2:16</a> . (2.) His enquiry is, <I>Whence shall we </I> <I>buy bread?</I> One would think, considering his poverty, that he should rather have asked, <I>Where </I> <I>shall we have money to buy for them?</I> But he will rather lay out all he has than they shall want. He will buy to give, and we must <I>labour,</I> that we may give, <a href="/ephesians/4-28.html">Eph.&nbsp;4:28</a> .3. The design of this enquiry; it was only to try the faith of Philip, <I>for he himself knew what </I> <I>he would do,</I> <a href="/john/6-6.html">v.&nbsp;6</a>. Note, (1.) Our Lord Jesus is never at a loss in his counsels; but, how difficult soever the case is, he knows what he has to do and what course he will take, <a href="/acts/15-18.html">Acts.&nbsp;15:18</a> . <I>He </I> <I>knows the thoughts he has towards his people</I> (<a href="/jeremiah/29-11.html">Jer.&nbsp;29:11</a> ) and is never at uncertainty; when we know not, he <I>himself knows what he will do.</I> (2.) When Christ is pleased to <I>puzzle</I> his people, it is only with a design to <I>prove</I> them. The question put Philip to a nonplus, yet Christ proposed it, to try whether he would say, &quot;Lord, if thou wilt exert thy power for them, we need not buy bread.&#146;&#146;4. Philip&#146;s answer to this question: <I>&quot;Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient,</I> <a href="/john/6-7.html">v.&nbsp;7</a>. Master, it is to no purpose to talk of buying bread for them, for neither will the country afford so much bread, nor can we afford to lay out so much money; ask Judas, who carries the bag.&#146;&#146; Two hundred pence of <I>their</I> money amount to about six pounds of <I>ours,</I> and, if they lay out all that at once, it will exhaust their fund, and break them, and they must starve themselves. Grotius computes that <I>two hundred pennyworth of bread</I> would scarcely reach to <I>two thousand,</I> but Philip would go as near hand as he could, would have <I>every one to take a little;</I> and nature, we say, is content with a little. See the weakness of Philip&#146;s faith, that in this strait, as if the Master of the family had been an <I>ordinary person,</I> he looked for supply only in an <I>ordinary way.</I> Christ might now have said to him, as he did afterwards, Have I <I>been so long time with you, and yet </I> <I>hast thou not known me, Philip?</I> Or, as God to Moses in a like case, <I>Is the Lord&#146;s hand waxen </I> <I>short?</I> We are apt thus to distrust God&#146;s power when visible and ordinary means fail, that is, to trust him no further than we can see him.5. The information which Christ received from another of his disciples concerning the provision they had. It was Andrew, here said to be <I>Simon Peter&#146;s brother;</I> though he was senior to Peter in discipleship, and instrumental to bring Peter to Christ, yet Peter afterwards so far outshone him that he is described by his relation to Peter: he acquainted Christ with what they had at hand; and in this we may see,(1.) The <I>strength</I> of his <I>love</I> to those for whom he saw his Master concerned, in that he was willing to bring out all they had, though he knew not but they might want themselves, and any one would have said, <I>Charity begins at home.</I> He did not go about to conceal it, under pretence of being a better husband of their provision than the master was, but honestly gives in an account of all they had. There is a lad here, <I>paidarion</I> &#151;<I>a little lad,</I> probably one that used to follow this company, as settlers do the camp, with provisions to sell, and the disciples had bespoken what he had for themselves; and it was <I>five barley-loaves,</I> and two small fishes. Here, [1.] The provision was <I>coarse</I> and <I>ordinary;</I> they were <I>barley loaves.</I> Canaan was a <I>land of </I> <I>wheat</I> (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-8.html">Deu.&nbsp;8:8</a> ); its inhabitants were commonly fed with the finest wheat (<a href="/psalms/81-16.html">Ps.&nbsp;81:16</a> ), the kidneys of wheat (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-14.html">Deu.&nbsp;32:14</a> ); yet Christ and his disciples were glad of <I>barley-bread.</I> It does not follow hence that we should tie ourselves to such coarse fare, and place religion in it (when God brings that which is finer to our hands, let us receive it, and be thankful); but it does follow that therefore we must not be <I>desirous of dainties</I> (<a href="/psalms/23-3.html">Ps.&nbsp;23:3</a> ); nor murmur if we be reduced to coarse fare, but be content and thankful, and well reconciled to it; barley-bread is what Christ <I>had,</I> and better than we <I>deserve.</I> Nor let us despise the mean provision of the poor, nor look upon it with contempt, remembering how Christ was provided for. [2.] It was but <I>short</I> and <I>scanty;</I> there were but <I>five loaves,</I> and those so small that one little lad carried them all; and we find (<a href="/2-kings/4-42.html">2 Ki.&nbsp;4:42</a>, <a href="/2-kings/4-43.html">2 Ki.&nbsp;4:43</a> ) that <I>twenty barley-loaves,</I> with some other provision to help out, would not dine a hundred men without a miracle. There were but two fishes, and those <I>small</I> ones (<I>dyo </I> <I>opsaria</I> ), so small that one of them was but a morsel, <I>pisciculi assati.</I> I take the fish to have been <I>pickled,</I> or <I>soused,</I> for they had not fire to dress them with. The provision of <I>bread</I> was <I>little,</I> but that of <I>fish</I> was <I>less</I> in proportion to it, so that many a bit of dry bread they must eat before they could make a meal of this provision; but they were content with it. <I>Bread</I> is meat for our hunger; but of those that murmured for flesh it is said, <I>They asked meat for their lust,</I> <a href="/psalms/78-18.html">Ps.&nbsp;78:18</a> . Well, Andrew was willing that the people should have this, as far as it would go. Note, A distrustful fear of wanting ourselves should not hinder us from needful charity to others.(2.) See here the <I>weakness</I> of his <I>faith</I> in that word, <I>&quot;But what are they among so many?</I> To offer this to such a multitude is but to mock them.&#146;&#146; Philip and he had not that actual consideration of the power of Christ (of which they had had such large experience) which they should have had. Who fed the camp of Israel in the wilderness? He that could make <I>one man </I> <I>chase a thousand</I> could make one loaf feed a thousand.6. The directions Christ gave the disciples to seat the guests (<a href="/john/6-10.html">v.&nbsp;10</a>): <I>&quot;Make the men sit </I> <I>down,</I> though you have nothing to set before them, and trust me for that.&#146;&#146; This was like <I>sending </I> <I>providence</I> to <I>market,</I> and going to buy without money: Christ would thus try their obedience. Observe, (1.) The furniture of the dining-room: <I>there was much grass in that place,</I> though a desert place; see how bountiful nature is, it <I>makes grass to grow upon the mountains,</I> <a href="/psalms/147-8.html">Ps.&nbsp;147:8</a> . This grass was uneaten; God gives not only enough, but more then enough. Here was this plenty of grass where Christ was preaching; the gospel brings other blessings along with it: <I>Then shall </I> <I>the earth yield her increase,</I> <a href="/psalms/67-6.html">Ps.&nbsp;67:6</a> . This plenty of grass made the place the more commodious for those that must sit on the ground, and served them for cushions, or <I>beds</I> (as they called what they sat on at meat, <a href="/esther/1-6.html">Esth.&nbsp;1:6</a> ), and, considering what Christ says of the grass of the field (<a href="/matthew/6-29.html">Mt.&nbsp;6:29</a>, <a href="/matthew/6-30.html">Mt.&nbsp;6:30</a> ), these beds excelled those of Ahasuerus: nature&#146;s pomp is the most glorious. (2.) The number of the guests: <I>About five thousand:</I> a great entertainment, representing that of the gospel, which is a <I>feast for all nations</I> (<a href="/isaiah/25-6.html">Isa.&nbsp;25:6</a> ), a feast for all <I>comers.</I> 7. The distribution of the provision, <a href="/john/6-11.html">v.&nbsp;11</a>. Observe,(1.) It was done with thanksgiving: <I>He gave thanks.</I> Note, [1.] We ought to give thanks to God for our food, for it is a mercy to have it, and we have it from the hand of God, and must <I>receive it with thanksgiving,</I> <a href="/1-timothy/4-4.html">1 Tim.&nbsp;4:4</a>, <a href="/1-timothy/4-5.html">1 Tim.&nbsp;4:5</a> . And this is the sweetness of our creature-comforts, that they will furnish us with <I>matter,</I> and give us occasion, for that excellent duty of thanksgiving. [2.] Though our provision be coarse and scanty, though we have neither plenty nor dainty, yet we must give thanks to God for what we have.(2.) It was distributed from the hand of Christ by the hands of his disciples, <a href="/john/6-11.html">v.&nbsp;11</a>. Note, [1.] All our comforts come to us <I>originally</I> from the hand of Christ; whoever <I>brings</I> them, it is he that <I>sends</I> them, he distributes to those who distribute to us. [2.] In distributing the bread of life to those that follow him, he is pleased to make use of the ministration of his disciples; they are the servitors at Christ&#146;s table, or rather rulers in his household, to give to <I>every one his </I> <I>portion of meat in due season.</I> (3.) It was done to universal satisfaction. They did not every one take a little, but all had <I>as </I> <I>much as they would;</I> not a short allowance, but a full meal; and considering how long they had fasted, with what an appetite they sat down, how agreeable this miraculous food may be supposed to have been, above common food, it was not a little that served them when they ate as much as they would and on free cost. Those whom Christ feeds with the bread of life he does not stint, <a href="/psalms/81-10.html">Ps.&nbsp;81:10</a> . There were but <I>two small fishes,</I> and yet they had <I>of them</I> too <I>as much </I> <I>as they would.</I> He did not reserve them for the better sort of the guests, and put off the poor with dry bread, but treated them all alike, for they were all alike welcome. Those who call feeding upon fish <I>fasting</I> reproach the entertainment Christ here made, which was a <I>full feast.</I> 8. The care that was taken of the broken meat. (1.) The orders Christ gave concerning it (<a href="/john/6-12.html">v.&nbsp;12</a>): <I>When they were filled,</I> and every man had within him a sensible witness to the truth of the miracle, Christ <I>said to the disciples,</I> the servants he employed, <I>Gather up the fragments.</I> Note, We must always take care that we make no waste of any of God&#146;s good creatures; for the grant we have of them, though large and full, is with this proviso, <I>wilful waste only excepted.</I> It is just with God to bring us to the want of that which we make waste of. The Jews were very careful not to lose any bread, nor let it fall to the ground, to be trodden upon. <I>Qui panem contemnit in </I> <I>gravem incidit paupertatem&#151;He who despises bread falls into the depths of poverty,</I> was a saying among them. Though Christ could command supplies whenever he pleased, yet he would have the fragments gathered up. When we are filled we must remember that others want, and we may want. Those that would have wherewith to be <I>charitable</I> must be <I>provident.</I> Had this broken meat been left upon the grass, the beasts and fowls would have gathered it up; but that which is fit to be meat for men is wasted and lost if it be thrown to the brute-creatures. Christ did not order the broken meat to be gathered up till all were filled; we must not begin to hoard and lay up till all is laid out that ought to be, for that is withholding more than is meet. Mr. Baxter notes here, &quot;How much less should we lose God&#146;s word, or helps, or our time, or such greater mercies!&#146;&#146; (2.) The observance of these orders (<a href="/john/6-13.html">v.&nbsp;13</a>): <I>They filled twelve baskets with </I> <I>the fragments,</I> which was an evidence not only of the <I>truth</I> of the miracle, that they were fed, not with fancy, but with real food (witness those remains), but of the <I>greatness</I> of it; they were not only filled, but there was all this over and above. See how large the divine bounty is; it not only <I>fills</I> the cup, but makes it <I>run over;</I> bread enough, and to spare, in our Father&#146;s house. The fragments filled twelve baskets, one for each disciple; they were thus repaid with interest for their willingness to part with what they had for public service; see <a href="/2-chronicles/31-10.html">2 Chr.&nbsp;31:10</a> . The Jews lay it as a law upon themselves, when they have eaten a meal, to be sure to leave a piece of bread upon the table, upon which the blessing after meat may rest; for it is a curse upon the wicked man (<a href="/job/20-21.html">Job.&nbsp;20:21</a> ) that <I>there shall none of his meat be left.</I> III. Here is the influence which this miracle had upon the people who tasted of the benefit of it (<a href="/john/6-14.html">v.&nbsp;14</a>): <I>They said, This is of a truth that prophet.</I> Note, 1. Even the vulgar Jews with great assurance expected the Messiah to come into the world, and to be a <I>great prophet,</I> They speak here with assurance of his coming. The Pharisees despised them as <I>not knowing the law;</I> but, it should seem, they knew more of him that is the <I>end of the law</I> than the Pharisees did. The miracles which Christ wrought did clearly demonstrate that he was the Messiah promised, a teacher come from God, the great prophet, and could not but convince the amazed spectators that this was he that should come. There were many who were convinced he was that prophet that should come into the world who yet did not cordially receive his doctrine, for they did not continue in it. Such a wretched incoherence and inconsistency there is between the faculties of the corrupt unsanctified soul, that it is possible for men to acknowledge that Christ is that prophet, and yet to turn a deaf ear to him.</p><p><a name="Joh6_15"></a><a name="Joh6_16"></a><a name="Joh6_17"></a><a name="Joh6_18"></a><a name="Joh6_19"></a><a name="Joh6_20"></a><a name="Joh6_21"></a> <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=John+6:15-21">Verses 15-21</a> Here is, I. Christ&#146;s retirement from the multitude.1. Observe what induced him to retire; because he perceived that those who acknowledged him to be that prophet that should come into the world would come, and <I>take him by force, to </I> <I>make him a king,</I> <a href="/john/6-15.html">v.&nbsp;15</a>. Now here we have an instance,(1.) Of the irregular zeal of some of Christ&#146;s followers; nothing would serve but they would make him <I>a king.</I> Now, [1.] This was <I>an act of zeal</I> for the honour of Christ, and against the contempt which the ruling part of the Jewish church put upon him. They were concerned to see so great a benefactor to the world so little esteemed in it; and therefore, since royal titles are counted the most illustrious, they would make him a king, knowing that the Messiah was to be a king; and if a prophet, like Moses, then a sovereign prince and lawgiver, like him; and, if they cannot set him up <I>upon the holy hill of Zion,</I> a <I>mountain</I> in Galilee shall serve for the present. Those whom Christ has feasted with the royal dainties of heaven should, in return for his favour, make him <I>their</I> king, and set him upon the throne in their souls: let him that has <I>fed</I> us <I>rule us.</I> But, [2.] It was an <I>irregular</I> zeal; for <I>First,</I> It was grounded upon a mistake concerning the nature of Christ&#146;s kingdom, as if it were to be <I>of this world,</I> and he must appear with outward pomp, a crown on his head, and an army at his foot; such a king as this they would make him, which was as great a disparagement to his glory as it would be to lacquer gold or paint a ruby. Right notions of Christ&#146;s kingdom would keep us to right methods for advancing it. <I>Secondly,</I> It was excited by the love of the flesh; they would make <I>him</I> their king who could feed them so plentifully without their toil, and save them from the curse of <I>eating their bread in the sweat of </I> <I>their face. Thirdly,</I> It was intended to carry on a <I>secular</I> design; they hoped this might be a fair opportunity of shaking off the Roman yoke, of which they were weary. If they had one to head them who could victual an army cheaper than another could provide for a family, they were sure of the sinews of the war, and could not fail of success, and the recovery of their ancient liberties. Thus is religion often prostituted to a secular interest, and Christ is served only to <I>serve a turn,</I> <a href="/romans/16-18.html">Rom.&nbsp;16:18</a> . <I>Vix quaritur</I> Jesus <I>properter</I> Jesusm, <I>sed propter aliud&#151;Jesus is </I> <I>usually sought after for something else, not for his own sake.</I> &#151;Augustine. Nay, <I>Fourthly,</I> It was a tumultuous, seditious attempt, and a disturbance of the public peace; it would make the country a seat of war, and expose it to the resentments of the Roman power. <I>Fifthly,</I> It was contrary to the mind of our Lord Jesus himself; for they would take him <I>by force,</I> whether he would or no. Note, Those who force honours upon Christ which he has not required at their hands displease him, and do him the greatest dishonour. Those that say <I>I am of Christ,</I> in opposition to those that are of Apollos and Cephas (so making Christ the head of a party), take him by force, to make him a king, contrary to his own mind.(2.) Here is an instance of the humility and self-denial of the Lord Jesus, that, when they would have made him a king, he <I>departed;</I> so far was he from countenancing the design that he effectually quashed it. Herein he has left a testimony, [1.] Against ambition and affectation of worldly honour, to which he was perfectly mortified, and has taught us to be so. Had they come to take him by force and make him a prisoner, he could not have been more industrious to abscond than he was when they would make him a king. Let us not then covet to be the <I>idols of </I> <I>the crowd,</I> nor be <I>desirous of vainglory.</I> [2.] Against faction and sedition, treason and rebellion, and whatever tends to disturb the peace of kings and provinces. By this it appears that he was no enemy to Caesar, nor would have his followers be so, but the <I>quiet in the land;</I> that he would have his ministers decline every thing that looks <I>like</I> sedition, or looks <I>towards</I> it, and improve their interest only for their work&#146;s sake.2. Observe <I>whither</I> he retired: <I>He departed again into a mountain,</I> <I>eis to oros</I> &#151;<I>into the</I> mountain, the mountain where he had preached (<a href="/john/6-3.html">v.&nbsp;3</a>), whence he came down into the plain, to feed the people, and then returned to it alone, to be private. Christ, though so useful in the places of concourse, yet chose sometimes to be alone, to teach us to sequester ourselves from the world now and then, for the more free converse with God and our own souls; and <I>never </I> <I>less alone,</I> says the serious Christian, <I>than when alone.</I> Public services must not jostle out private devotions.II. Here is the disciples&#146; distress at sea. <I>They that go down to the sea in ships, these see the </I> <I>works of the Lord, for he raiseth the stormy wind,</I> <a href="/psalms/17-23.html">Ps.&nbsp;17:23</a>, <a href="/psalms/17-24.html">Ps.&nbsp;17:24</a> . Apply this to these disciples.1. Here is their <I>going down to the sea</I> in a ship (<a href="/john/6-16.html">v.&nbsp;16</a>, <a href="/john/6-17.html">v.&nbsp;17</a>): <I>When even was come,</I> and they had done their day&#146;s work, it was time to look homeward, and therefore they went aboard, and set sail for Capernaum. This they did by particular direction from their Master, with design (as it should seem) to get them out of the way of the temptation of countenancing those that would have made him a king.2. Here is the <I>stormy wind</I> arising and <I>fulfilling the word of God.</I> They were Christ&#146;s disciples, and were now in the way of their duty, and Christ was now in the mount praying for them; and yet they were in this distress. The perils and afflictions of this present time may very well consist with our interest in Christ and his intercession. They had lately been feasted at Christ&#146;s table; but after the sun-shine of comfort expect a storm. (1.) <I>It was now dark;</I> this made the storm the more dangerous and uncomfortable. Sometimes the people of God are in trouble, and cannot see their way out; in the dark concerning the cause of their trouble, concerning the design and tendency of it, and what the issue will be. (2.) Jesus <I>was not come to </I> <I>them.</I> When they were in that storm (<a href="/matthew/8-23.html">Mt.&nbsp;8:23</a> ,  etc.) <I>Jesus was with them;</I> but now their beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone. The absence of Christ is the great aggravation of the troubles of Christians. (3.) The <I>sea arose by reason of a great wind.</I> It was calm and fair when they put to sea (they were not so presumptuous as to launch out in a storm), but it arose when they were <I>at sea.</I> In times of tranquillity we must prepare for trouble, for it may arise when we little think of it. Let it comfort good people, when they happen to be in storms at sea, that the disciples of Christ were so; and let the promises of a gracious God balance the threats of an angry sea. Though in a storm, and <I>in the dark,</I> they are no worse off than Christ&#146;s disciples were. Clouds and darkness sometimes surround the children of the light, and of the day.3. Here is Christ&#146;s seasonable approach to them when they were in this peril, <a href="/john/6-19.html">v.&nbsp;19</a>. <I>They </I> <I>had rowed</I> (being forced by the contrary winds to betake themselves to their oars) <I>about </I> <I>twenty-five or thirty furlongs.</I> The Holy Spirit that indicted this could have ascertained the number of furlongs precisely, but this, being only circumstantial, is left to be expressed according to the conjecture of the penman. And, when they were got off a good way at sea, they <I>see </I> <I>Jesus walking on the sea.</I> See here, (1.) The power Christ has over the laws and customs of nature, to control and dispense with them at his pleasure. It is natural for heavy bodies to sink in water, but Christ walked <I>upon</I> the water as upon dry land, which was more than Moses&#146;s dividing the water and walking <I>through</I> the water. (2.) The concern Christ has for his disciples in distress: <I>He drew nigh to the ship;</I> for <I>therefore</I> he walked upon the water, as he <I>rides upon </I> <I>the heavens, for the help of his people,</I> <a href="/deuteronomy/33-26.html">Deu.&nbsp;33:26</a> . He will not leave them comfortless when they seem to be <I>tossed with tempests</I> and <I>not comforted.</I> When they are banished (as John) into remote places, or shut up (as Paul and Silas) in close places, he will find access to them, and will be nigh them. (3.) The relief Christ gives to his disciples in their fears. They <I>were afraid,</I> more afraid of an apparition (for so they supposed him to be) than of the winds and waves. It is more terrible to wrestle with the rulers of the darkness of this world than with a tempestuous sea. When they thought a demon haunted them, and perhaps was instrumental to raise the storm, they were more terrified than they had been while they saw nothing in it but what was natural. Note, [1.] Our real distresses are often much increased by our imaginary ones, the creatures of our own fancy. [2.] Even the approaches of comfort and deliverance are often so misconstrued as to become the occasions of fear and perplexity. We are often not only <I>worse </I> <I>frightened than hurt,</I> but <I>then</I> most <I>frightened</I> when we are ready to be <I>helped.</I> But, when they were in this fright, how affectionately did Christ silence their fears with that compassionate word (<a href="/john/6-20.html">v.&nbsp;20</a>), <I>It is I, be not afraid!</I> Nothing is more powerful to convince sinners than that word, <I>I am </I> <I>Jesus whom thou persecutest;</I> nothing more powerful to comfort saints than this, <I>&quot;I am Jesus </I> <I>whom thou lovest;</I> it is I that love thee, and seek thy good; be not afraid of me, nor of the storm.&#146;&#146; When trouble is nigh Christ is nigh.4. Here is their speedy arrival at the port they were bound for, <a href="/john/6-17.html">v.&nbsp;17</a>. (1.) They <I>welcomed</I> Christ into the ship; they <I>willingly received him.</I> Note, Christ&#146;s absenting himself for a time is but so much the more to <I>endear himself,</I> at his return, to his disciples, who value his presence above any thing; see Cant:4. (2.) Christ brought them safely to the shore: <I>Immediately the ship was </I> <I>at the land whither they went.</I> Note, [1.] The ship of the church, in which the disciples of Christ have <I>embarked</I> themselves and their all, may be much shattered and distressed, yet it shall come safe to the harbour at last; <I>tossed</I> at sea, but not <I>lost;</I> cast down, but not destroyed; the bush burning, but not consumed. [2.] The power and presence of the church&#146;s King shall expedite and facilitate her deliverance, and conquer the difficulties which have baffled the skill and industry of all her other friends. The disciples had rowed hard, but could not make their point till they had got Christ in the ship, and then the work was <I>done suddenly.</I> If we have received Christ Jesus the Lord, have received him willingly, though the night be dark and the wind high, yet we may comfort ourselves with this, that we shall be at shore shortly, and are nearer to it than we think we are. Many a doubting soul is fetched to heaven by a pleasing surprise, or ever it is aware.</p><p><a name="Joh6_22"></a><a name="Joh6_23"></a><a name="Joh6_24"></a><a name="Joh6_25"></a><a name="Joh6_26"></a><a name="Joh6_27"></a> <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=John+6:22-27">Verses 22-27</a> In these verses we have,I. The careful enquiry which the people made after Christ, <a href="/john/6-23.html">v.&nbsp;23</a>, <a href="/john/6-24.html">v.&nbsp;24</a>. They saw the disciples go to sea; they saw Christ retire to the mountain, probably with an intimation that he desired to be private for some time; but, their hearts being set upon <I>making him a king,</I> they way-laid his return, and <I>the day following,</I> the hot fit of their zeal still continuing,1. They were <I>much at a loss</I> for him. He was gone, and they knew not what was become of him. They saw there was <I>no boat there</I> but that in which the disciples went off, Providence so ordering it for the confirming of the miracle of his walking on the sea, for there was no boat for him to go in. They observed also that <I>Jesus did not go with his disciples,</I> but that they went off alone, and left him among <I>them</I> on <I>their</I> side of the water. Note, Those that would find Christ must diligently observe all his motions, and learn to understand the tokens of his presence and absence, that they may steer accordingly.2. They were very <I>industrious in seeking</I> him. They searched the places thereabouts, and when <I>they saw that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples</I> (neither he nor any one that could give tidings of him), they resolved to search elsewhere. Note, Those that would find Christ must accomplish a diligent search, must seek till they find, must go from sea to sea, to seek the word of God, rather than live without it; and those whom Christ has feasted with the bread of life should have their souls carried out in earnest desires towards him. Much would have more, in communion with Christ. Now, (1.) They resolved to go to Capernaum in quest of him. There were his head-quarters, where he usually resided. Thither his disciples were gone; and they knew he would not be long absent from <I>them.</I> Those that would find Christ must go forth by the footsteps of the flock. (2.) Providence favoured them with an opportunity of going thither by sea, which was the speediest way; for there <I>came other boats from Tiberias,</I> which lay further off upon the same shore, <I>nigh,</I> though not so nigh to the place where they did <I>eat bread,</I> in which they might soon make a trip to Capernaum, and probably the boats were bound for that port. Note, Those that in sincerity seek Christ, and seek opportunities of converse with him, are commonly owned and assisted by Providence in those pursuits. The evangelist, having occasion to mention their eating the <I>multiplied</I> bread, adds, <I>After that the Lord had given thanks,</I> <a href="/john/6-11.html">v.&nbsp;11</a>. So much were the disciples affected with their Master&#146;s giving thanks that they could never forget the impressions made upon them by it, but took a pleasure in remembering the gracious words that then proceeded out of his mouth. This was the grace and beauty of that meal, and made it remarkable; their hearts burned within them.3. They laid hold of the opportunity that offered itself, and <I>they also took shipping, and </I> <I>came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus.</I> They did not defer, in hopes to see him again <I>on this </I> <I>side the water;</I> but their convictions being strong, and their desires warm, they followed him presently. Good motions are often crushed, and come to nothing, for want of being <I>prosecuted</I> in <I>time.</I> They came to Capernaum, and, for aught that appears, these unsound hypocritical followers of Christ had a <I>calm</I> and <I>pleasant</I> passage, while his sincere disciples had a <I>rough</I> and <I>stormy</I> one. It is not strange if it fare worst with the best men in this evil world. They <I>came, </I> <I>seeking Jesus.</I> Note, Those that would find Christ, and find comfort in him, must be willing to take pains, and, as here, to <I>compass</I> sea and land to seek and serve him who came from heaven to earth to seek and save us.II. The success of this enquiry: <I>They found him on the other side of the sea,</I> <a href="/john/6-25.html">v.&nbsp;25</a>. Note, Christ will be found of those that seek him, first or last; and it is worth while to cross a sea, nay, to go <I>from sea to sea, and from the river to the ends of the earth,</I> to seek Christ, if we may but find him at last. These people appeared afterwards to be unsound, and not actuated by any good principle, and yet were thus zealous. Note, Hypocrites may be very forward in their attendance on God&#146;s ordinances. If men have <I>no more</I> to show for their love to Christ than their running after sermons and prayers, and their pangs of affection to good preaching, they have reason to suspect themselves no better than this <I>eager crowd.</I> But though these people were no better principled, and Christ knew it, yet he was willing to be found of them, and admitted them into fellowship with him. If we could know the hearts of hypocrites, yet, while their profession is plausible, we must not exclude them from our communion, much less when we do not know their hearts.III. The question they put to him when they found him: <I>Rabbi, when camest thou hither?</I> It should seem by <a href="/john/6-59.html">v.&nbsp;59</a>that they found him <I>in the synagogue.</I> They knew this was the likeliest place to seek Christ in, for it was <I>his custom</I> to attend public assemblies for religious worship, <a href="/luke/4-16.html">Lu.&nbsp;4:16</a> . Note, Christ must be sought, and will be found, in the congregations of his people and in the administration of his ordinances; public worship is what Christ chooses to own and grace with his presence and the manifestations of himself. There they found him, and all they had to say to him was, <I>Rabbi, when camest thou hither?</I> They saw he would not be made a king, and therefore say no more of this, but call him Rabbi, their teacher. Their enquiry refers not only to the <I>time,</I> but to the <I>manner,</I> of his conveying himself thither; not only <I>When,</I> but, <I>&quot;How,</I> camest thou thither?&#146;&#146; for there was no boat for him to come in. They were curious in asking concerning Christ&#146;s motions, but not solicitous to observe their own.IV. The answer Christ gave them, not direct to their question (what was it to them <I>when</I> and <I>how</I> he came thither?) but such an answer as their case required.1. He discovers the <I>corrupt principle</I> they <I>acted from</I> in following him (<a href="/john/6-26.html">v.&nbsp;26</a>): <I>&quot;Verily, </I> <I>verily, I say unto you,</I> I that search the heart, and know what is in man, I the Amen, the faithful witness, <a href="/revelation/3-14.html">Rev.&nbsp;3:14</a>, <a href="/revelation/3-15.html">Rev.&nbsp;3:15</a> . <I>You seek me;</I> that is well, but it is not from a good principle.&#146;&#146; Christ knows not only <I>what</I> we do, but <I>why</I> we do it. These followed Christ, (1.) Not for his doctrine&#146;s sake: <I>Not because you saw the miracles.</I> The miracles were the great confirmation of his doctrine; Nicodemus sought for him for the sake of them <a href="/john/3-2.html">ch.&nbsp;3:2</a> ), and argued from the power of his works to the truth of his word; but these were so stupid and mindless that they never considered this. But, (2.) It was for their own bellies&#146; sake: <I>Because you did eat of the </I> <I>loaves, and were filled;</I> not because he taught them, but because he fed them. He had given them, [1.] A <I>full</I> meal&#146;s meat: <I>They did eat, and were filled;</I> and some of them perhaps were so poor that they had not known of a long time before now what it was to have enough, to eat and leave. [2.] A <I>dainty</I> meal&#146;s meat; it is probable that, as the miraculous wine was the best wine, so was the miraculous food more than usually pleasant. [3.] A <I>cheap</I> meal&#146;s meat, that cost them nothing; no reckoning was brought in. Note, Many follow Christ for <I>loaves,</I> and not for <I>love.</I> Thus those do who aim at secular advantage in their profession of religion, and follow it because by this craft they get their preferments. <I>Quantis profuit nobis haec fabula de </I> <I>Christo&#151;This fable respecting Christ, what a gainful concern we have made of it!</I> said one of the popes. These people <I>complimented</I> Christ with Rabbi, and showed him great respect, yet he told them thus faithfully of their hypocrisy; his ministers must hence learn not to flatter those that flatter them, nor to be <I>bribed</I> by fair words to cry <I>peace</I> to all that cry <I>rabbi</I> to them, but to give faithful reproofs where there is cause for them.2. He directs them to better principles (<a href="/john/6-27.html">v.&nbsp;27</a>): <I>Labour for that meat which endures to </I> <I>everlasting life.</I> With the woman of Samaria he had discoursed of spiritual things under the similitude of <I>water;</I> here he speaks of them under the similitude of <I>meat,</I> taking occasion from the loaves they had eaten. His design is,(1.) To moderate our worldly pursuits: <I>Labour not for the meat that perishes.</I> This does not forbid honest labour for food convenient, <a href="/2-thessalonians/3-12.html">2 Th.&nbsp;3:12</a> . But we must not make the things of this world our chief care and concern. Note, [1.] The things of the world are <I>meat that perishes.</I> Worldly wealth, honour, and pleasure, are <I>meat;</I> they <I>feed the fancy</I> (and many times this is all) and <I>fill the belly.</I> These are things which mean <I>hunger</I> after as <I>meat,</I> and glut themselves with, and which a carnal heart, as long as they last, may make a shift to live upon; but they <I>perish,</I> are of a perishing nature, wither of themselves, and are exposed to a thousand accidents; those that have the largest share of them are not sure to have them while they live, but are sure to leave them and lose them when they die. [2.] It is therefore folly for us inordinately to labour after them. <I>First,</I> We must not labour in religion, nor work the works thereof, <I>for this perishing meat,</I> with an eye to this; we must not make our religion subservient to a worldly interest, nor aim at <I>secular advantages</I> in <I>sacred exercises. Secondly,</I> We must not at all <I>labour</I> for this meat; that is, we must not make these perishing things our <I>chief good,</I> nor make our care and pains about them our <I>chief business;</I> not seek those things <I>first</I> and <I>most,</I> <a href="/proverbs/23-4.html">Prov.&nbsp;23:4</a>, <a href="/proverbs/23-5.html">Prov.&nbsp;23:5</a> .(2.) To quicken and excite our gracious pursuits: &quot;Bestow your pains to better purpose, and <I>labour for that meat</I> which belongs to the soul,&#146;&#146; of which he shows,[1.] That it is <I>unspeakably desirable:</I> It is meat which <I>endures to everlasting life;</I> it is a happiness which will last as long as we must, which not only itself endures eternally, but will nourish us up to everlasting life. The blessings of the new covenant are our preparative for eternal life, our preservative to it, and the pledge and earnest of it.[2.] It is <I>undoubtedly attainable.</I> Shall all the treasures of the world be ransacked, and all the fruits of the earth gathered together, to furnish us with provisions that will last to eternity? No, <I>The sea saith, It is not in me,</I> among all the treasures hidden in the sand. <I>It cannot be gotten for </I> <I>gold;</I> but it is that <I>which the Son of man shall give;</I> <I>hen dosei</I> , either which <I>meat,</I> or which <I>life,</I> the Son of man shall give. Observe here, <I>First,</I> Who gives this meat: the <I>Son of man,</I> the great householder and master of the stores, who is entrusted with the administration of the kingdom of God among men, and the dispensation of the gifts, graces, and comforts of that kingdom, and has power to give eternal life, with all the means of it and preparatives for it. We are told to <I>labour for it,</I> as if it were to be got by our own industry, and sold upon that valuable consideration, as the heathen said, <I>Dii laboribus omnia vendunt&#151;The gods sell all advantages to </I> <I>the industrious.</I> But when we have laboured ever so much for it, we have not merited it as our <I>hire,</I> but the Son of man <I>gives it.</I> And what more free than gift? It is an encouragement that he who has the giving of it is the <I>Son of man,</I> for then we may hope the <I>sons of men</I> that seek it, and labour for it, shall not fail to have it. <I>Secondly,</I> What authority he has to give it; for <I>him has </I> <I>God the Father sealed,</I> <I>touton gar ho Pater esphragisen, ho Theos</I> &#151;<I>for him the Father has </I> <I>sealed</I> (proved and evidenced) <I>to be God;</I> so some read it; he has declared him to be the Son of God with power. He has <I>sealed him,</I> that is, has given him full authority to deal between God and man, as God&#146;s <I>ambassador</I> to man and man&#146;s <I>intercessor</I> with God, and has proved his commission by miracles. Having given him <I>authority,</I> he has given us <I>assurance</I> of it; having entrusted him with <I>unlimited powers,</I> he has satisfied us with <I>undoubted proofs</I> of them; so that as he might go on with confidence in his undertaking for us, so may we in our resignations to him. <I>God the Father</I> scaled him with the Spirit that rested on him, by the voice from heaven, by the testimony he bore to him in signs and wonders. Divine revelation is perfected in him, in him the <I>vision</I> and <I>prophecy</I> is <I>sealed up</I> (<a href="/daniel/9-24.html">Dan.&nbsp;9:24</a> ), to him all believers <I>seal</I> that he is true <a href="/john/3-33.html">ch.&nbsp;3:33</a> ), and in him they are all <I>sealed,</I> <a href="/2-corinthians/1-22.html">2 Co.&nbsp;1:22</a> .</p></span><div class="Global-Page-Links"><a class="Previous" href="/commentaries/matthew-henry-complete/john/6.html">Prev</a><div class="GlobalPageLinksContainer"><ul><a name="PageLink-1" class="PageLink-1 active" href="/commentaries/matthew-henry-complete/john/6.html" >1</a><a name="PageLink-2" class="PageLink-2 " href="/commentaries/matthew-henry-complete/john/6.html?p=2" >2</a></ul>
