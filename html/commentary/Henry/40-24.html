		<span id="Page-1" style=""><b><a href="/matthew/24.html">Chapter&nbsp;24</a></b><P>Christ&#146;s preaching was mostly practical; but, in this chapter, we have a prophetical discourse, a prediction of things to come; such however as had a practical tendency, and was intended, not to gratify the curiosity of his disciples, but to guide their consciences and conversations, and it is therefore concluded with a practical application. The church has always had particular prophecies, besides general promises, both for direction and for encouragement to believers; but it is observable, Christ preached this prophetical sermon in the close of his ministry, as the Apocalypse is the last book of the New Testament, and the prophetical books of the Old Testament are placed last, to intimate to us, that we must be well grounded in plain truths and duties, and those must first be well digested, before we dive into those things that are dark and difficult; many run themselves into confusion by beginning their Bible at the wrong end. Now, in this chapter, we have, <I>I. The occasion of this discourse (<a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=matthew+24:1-3">v.&nbsp;1-3</a>). II. The discourse itself, in which we have, 1. The prophecy of divers events, especially referring to the destruction of Jerusalem, and the utter ruin of the Jewish church and nation, which were not hastening on, and were completed about forty years after; the prefaces to that destruction, the concomitants and consequences of it; yet looking further, to Christ&#146;s coming at the end of time, and the consummation of all things, of which that was a type and figure (<a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=matthew+24:4-31">v.&nbsp;4-31</a>). The practical application of this prophecy for the awakening and quickening of his disciples to prepare for these great and awful things (<a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=matthew+24:32-51">v.&nbsp;32-51</a>).</I></p><p><a name="Mt24_1"></a><a name="Mt24_2"></a><a name="Mt24_3"></a> <a href="/bible/passage.aspx?q=Matthew+24:1-3">Verses 1-3</a> Here is,I. Christ&#146;s quitting <I>the temple,</I> and his public work there. He had said, in the close of the foregoing chapter, <I>Your house is left unto you desolate;</I> and here he made his words good; <I>He </I> <I>went out, and departed from the temple.</I> The manner of expression is observable; he not only went out of the temple, but departed from it, took his final farewell of it; he departed from it, never to return to it any more; and then immediately follows a prediction of its ruin. Note, That house is left desolate indeed, which Christ leaves. <I>Woe unto them when I depart,</I> <a href="/hosea/9-12.html">Hos.&nbsp;9:12</a> ; <a href="/jeremiah/6-8.html">Jer.&nbsp;6:8</a> . It was now time to groan out their <I>Ichabod, The glory is departed, their defence is </I> <I>departed.</I> Three days after this, the veil of the temple was rent; when Christ left it, all became <I>common and unclean;</I> but Christ departed not till they drove him away; did not reject them, till they first rejected him.II. His private discourse with his disciples; he left the temple, but he did not leave the twelve, who were the seed of the gospel church, which the casting off of the Jews was the enriching of. When he left the temple, his disciples left it too, and came to him. Note, It is good being where Christ is, and leaving that which he leaves. They came to him, to be instructed in private, when his public preaching was over; for <I>the secret of the Lord is with them that fear </I> <I>him.</I> He had spoken of the destruction of the Jewish church to the multitude in parables, which here, as usual, he explains to his disciples. Observe,1. <I>His disciples came to him, to show him the buildings of the temple,</I> It was a stately and beautiful structure, one of the wonders of the world; no cost was spared, no art left untried, to make it sumptuous. Though it came short of Solomon&#146;s temple, and <I>its beginning was small,</I> yet <I>its latter end did greatly increase.</I> It was richly furnished with gifts and offerings, to which there were continual additions made. They showed Christ these things, and desired him to take notice of them, either,(1.) As being greatly pleased with them themselves, and expecting he should be so too. They had lived mostly in Galilee, at a distance from the temple, had seldom seen it, and therefore were the more struck with admiration at it, and thought he should admire as much as they did <I>all this glory</I> (<a href="/genesis/31-1.html">Gen.&nbsp;31:1</a> ); and they would have him divert himself (after his preaching, and from his sorrow which they saw him perhaps almost overwhelmed with) with looking about him. Note, Even good men are apt to be too much enamoured with outward pomp and gaiety, and to overvalue it, even in the things of God; whereas we should be, as Christ was, dead to it, and look upon it with contempt. The temple was indeed glorious, but, [1.] Its glory was sullied and stained with the sin of the priests and people; that wicked doctrine of the Pharisees, which preferred the gold before the temple that sanctified it, was enough to deface the beauty of all the ornaments of the temple. [2.] Its glory was eclipsed and outdone by the presence of Christ in it, who was <I>the glory of this latter house</I> (<a href="/haggai/2-9.html">Hag.&nbsp;2:9</a> ), so that the buildings had no glory, in comparison with that glory which excelled.Or, (2.) As grieving that this house should be left desolate; they showed him the buildings, as if they would move him to reverse the sentence; &quot;Lord, let not this holy and beautiful house, where our fathers praised thee, be made a desolation.&#146;&#146; They forgot how many providences, concerning Solomon&#146;s temple, had manifested how little God cared for that outward glory which they had so much admired, when the people were wicked, <a href="/2-chronicles/7-21.html">2 Chr.&nbsp;7:21</a> . <I>This house, which is </I> <I>high,</I> sin will bring low. Christ had lately looked upon <I>the precious souls, and wept for them,</I> <a href="/luke/19-41.html">Lu.&nbsp;19:41</a> . The disciples look upon the pompous buildings, and are ready to weep for them. In this, as in other things, <I>his thoughts are not like ours.</I> It was weakness, and meanness of spirit, in the disciples, to be so fond of fine buildings; it was a childish thing. <I>Animo magno nihil </I> <I>magnum&#151;To a great mind nothing is great.</I> Seneca.2. Christ, hereupon, foretels the utter ruin and destruction that were coming upon this place, <a href="/matthew/24-2.html">v.&nbsp;2</a>. Note, A believing foresight of the defacing of all worldly glory will help to take us off from admiring it, and overvaluing it. The most beautiful body will be shortly worms&#146; meat, and the most beautiful building a ruinous heap. And shall we then set our eyes upon that which so soon is not, and look upon that with so much admiration which ere long we shall certainly look upon with so much contempt? <I>See ye not all these things?</I> They would have Christ look upon them, and be as much in love with them as they were; he would have them look upon them, and be as dead to them as he was. There is such a sight of these things as will do us good; so to see them as to see through them and see to the end of them.Christ, instead of reversing the decree, ratifies it; <I>Verily, I say unto you, there shall not be </I> <I>left one stone upon another.</I> (1.) He speaks of it as a certain ruin; <I>&quot;I say unto you. I,</I> that know what I say, and know how to make good what I say; take my word for it, it shall be so; <I>I, the Amen, the true Witness, </I> <I>say it to you.&#146;&#146;</I> All judgment being committed to the Son, the threatenings, as well as the promises, are all <I>yea, and amen, in him.</I> <a href="/hebrews/6-17.html">Heb.&nbsp;6:17</a>, <a href="/hebrews/6-18.html">Heb.&nbsp;6:18</a> .(2.) He speaks of it as an utter ruin. The temple shall not only be stripped, and plundered, and defaced, but utterly demolished and laid waste; <I>Not one stone shall be left upon another.</I> Notice is taken, in the <I>building</I> of the second temple, of the <I>laying of one stone upon another</I> (<a href="/haggai/2-15.html">Hag.&nbsp;2:15</a> ); and here, in the <I>ruin,</I> of <I>not leaving one stone upon another.</I> History tells us, that this was fulfilled in the latter; for though Titus, when he took the city, did all he could to preserve the temple, yet he could not restrain the enraged soldiers from destroying it utterly; and it was done to that degree, that Turnus Rufus ploughed up the ground on which it had stood: thus that scripture was fulfilled (<a href="/micah/3-12.html">Mic.&nbsp;3:12</a> ), <I>Zion shall, for your sake, be ploughed as a </I> <I>field.</I> And afterward, in Julian the Apostate&#146;s time, when the Jews were encouraged by him to rebuild their temple, in opposition to the Christian religion, what remained of the ruins was quite pulled down, to level the ground for a new foundation; but the attempt was defeated by the miraculous eruption of fire out of the ground, which destroyed the foundation they laid, and frightened away the builders. Now this prediction of the final and irreparable ruin of the temple includes a prediction of the period of the Levitical priesthood and the ceremonial law.3. The disciples, not disputing either the truth or the equity of this sentence, nor doubting of the accomplishment of it, enquire more particularly of the time when it should come to pass, and the signs of its approach, <a href="/matthew/24-3.html">v.&nbsp;3</a>. Observe,(1.) Where they made this enquiry; privately, <I>as he sat upon the mount of Olives;</I> probably, he was returning to Bethany, and there sat down by the way, to rest him; the mount of Olives directly faced the temple, and from thence he might have a full prospect of it at some distance; there he sat as a Judge upon the bench, the temple and city being before him as at the bar, and thus he passed sentence on them. We read (<a href="/ezekiel/11-23.html">Eze.&nbsp;11:23</a> ) of the removing of the glory of the Lord from the temple to the mountain; so Christ, the great Shechinah, here removes to this mountain.(2.) What the enquiry itself was; <I>When shall these things be; and what shall be the sign of </I> <I>thy coming, and of the end of the world?</I> Here are three questions.[1.] Some think, these questions do all point at one and the same thing&#151;the destruction of the temple, and the period of the Jewish church and nation, which Christ had himself spoken of as his coming <a href="/matthew/16-28.html">ch.&nbsp;16:28</a> ), and which would be the consummation of the age (for so it may be read), the finishing of that dispensation. Or, they thought the destruction of the temple must needs be the end of the world. If that house be laid waste, the world cannot stand; for the Rabbin used to say that the house of the sanctuary was one of the seven things for the sake of which the world was made; and they think, if so, the world will not survive the temple.[2.] Others think their question, <I>When shall these things be?</I> refers to the destruction of Jerusalem, and the other two to the end of the world; or Christ&#146;s coming may refer to his setting up his gospel kingdom, and the end of the world to the day of judgment. I rather incline to think that their question looked no further than the event Christ now foretold; but it appears by other passages, that they had very confused thoughts of future events; so that perhaps it is not possible to put any certain construction upon this question of theirs.But Christ, in his answer, though he does not expressly rectify the mistakes of his disciples (that must be done by the pouring out of the Spirit), yet looks further than their question, and instructs his church, not only concerning the great events of that age, the destruction of Jerusalem, but concerning his second coming at the end of time, which here he insensibly slides into a discourse of, and of that it is plain he speaks in the next chapter, which is a continuation of this sermon.</p></span><div class="Global-Page-Links"><a class="Previous" href="/commentaries/matthew-henry-complete/matthew/24.html">Prev</a><div class="GlobalPageLinksContainer"><ul><a name="PageLink-1" class="PageLink-1 active" href="/commentaries/matthew-henry-complete/matthew/24.html" >1</a><a name="PageLink-2" class="PageLink-2 " href="/commentaries/matthew-henry-complete/matthew/24.html?p=2" >2</a><a name="PageLink-3" class="PageLink-3 " href="/commentaries/matthew-henry-complete/matthew/24.html?p=3" >3</a></ul>
