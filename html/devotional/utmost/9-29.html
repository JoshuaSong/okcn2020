<b>The
Awareness of the Call

</b><span>(1Co 9:16)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>We
are inclined to forget the deeply spiritual and supernatural touch of God. If
you are able to tell exactly where you were when you received the call of God
and can explain all about it, I question whether you have truly been called.
The call of God does not come like that; it is much more supernatural. The
realization of the call in a person''s life may come like a clap of thunder or
it may dawn gradually. But however quickly or slowly this awareness comes, it
is always accompanied with an undercurrent of the supernatural --- something
that is inexpressible and produces a &quot;glow.&quot; At any moment the sudden
awareness of this incalculable, supernatural, surprising call that has taken
hold of your life may break through --- &quot;I chose you . . .&quot; (<span
>Joh 15:16</span>). The call of God has nothing to do
with salvation and sanctification. You are not called to preach the gospel
because you are sanctified; the call to preach the gospel is infinitely
different. Paul describes it as a compulsion that was placed upon him.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>If
you have ignored, and thereby removed, the great supernatural call of God in
your life, take a review of your circumstances. See where you have put your own
ideas of service or your particular abilities ahead of the call of God. Paul
said, &quot;. . . woe is me if I do not preach the gospel!&quot; He had become
aware of the call of God, and his compulsion to &quot;preach the gospel&quot;
was so strong that nothing else was any longer even a competitor for his
strength.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>If
a man or woman is called of God, it doesn''t matter how difficult the
circumstances may be. God orchestrates every force at work for His purpose in
the end. If you will agree with God''s purpose, He will bring not only your
conscious level but also all the deeper levels of your life, which you yourself
cannot reach, into perfect harmony.
