<b>Individuality

</b><span>(Mat 16:24)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Individuality
is the hard outer layer surrounding the inner spiritual life. Individuality
shoves others aside, separating and isolating people. We see it as the primary
characteristic of a child, and rightly so. When we confuse individuality with
the spiritual life, we remain isolated. This shell of individuality is God''s
created natural covering designed to protect the spiritual life. But our
individuality must be yielded to God so that our spiritual life may be brought
forth into fellowship with Him. Individuality counterfeits spirituality, just
as lust counterfeits love. God designed human nature for Himself, but
individuality corrupts that human nature for its own purposes.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
characteristics of individuality are independence and self-will. We hinder our
spiritual growth more than any other way by continually asserting our
individuality. If you say, &quot;I can''t believe,&quot; it is because your
individuality is blocking the way; individuality can never believe. But our spirit
cannot help believing. Watch yourself closely when the Spirit of God is at work
in you. He pushes you to the limits of your individuality where a choice must
be made. The choice is either to say, &quot;I will not surrender,&quot; or to
surrender, breaking the hard shell of individuality, which allows the spiritual
life to emerge. The Holy Spirit narrows it down every time to one thing (<span
>Mat 5:23-24</span>). It is your individuality that
refuses to &quot;be reconciled to your brother&quot; (<span
>Mat 5:24</span>). God wants to bring you into union
with Himself, but unless you are willing to give up your right to yourself, He
cannot. &quot;. . . let him deny himself . . .&quot; --- deny his independent
right to himself. Then the real life --- the spiritual life --- is allowed the
opportunity to grow.
