<b>Watching
With Jesus

</b><span>(Mat 26:38)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Watch
with Me.&quot; Jesus was saying, in effect, &quot;Watch with no private point
of view at all, but watch solely and entirely with Me.&quot; In the early
stages of our Christian life, we do not watch <i>with</i> Jesus, we watch <i>for</i>
Him. We do not watch with Him through the revealed truth of the Bible even in
the circumstances of our own lives. Our Lord is trying to introduce us to
identification with Himself through a particular &quot;Gethsemane&quot;
experience of our own. But we refuse to go, saying, &quot;No, Lord, I can''t
see the meaning of this, and besides, it''s very painful.&quot; And how can we
possibly watch with Someone who is so incomprehensible? How are we going to
understand Jesus sufficiently to watch with Him in His Gethsemane, when we
don''t even know why He is suffering? We don''t know how to watch with Him ---
we are only used to the idea of Jesus watching with us.

<br/>The
disciples loved Jesus Christ to the limit of their natural capacity, but they
did not fully understand His purpose. In the Garden of Gethsemane they slept as
a result of their own sorrow, and at the end of three years of the closest and
most intimate relationship of their lives they &quot;all . . . forsook Him and
fled&quot; (Mat 26:56</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;They
were all filled with the Holy Spirit . . .&quot; (Act 2:4</span>).
&quot;They&quot; refers to the same people, but something wonderful has
happened between these two events --- our Lord''s death, resurrection, and
ascension --- and the disciples have now been invaded and &quot;filled with the
Holy Spirit.&quot; Our Lord had said, &quot;You shall receive power when the
Holy Spirit has come upon you . . .&quot; (Act 1:8</span>).
This meant that they learned to watch <i>with</i> Him the rest of their lives.
