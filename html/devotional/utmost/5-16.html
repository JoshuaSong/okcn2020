<b>The
Habit of Recognizing God &amp; His Provision

</b><span>(2Pe 1:4)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>We
are made &quot;partakers of the divine nature,&quot; receiving and sharing
God''s own nature through His promises. Then we have to work that divine nature
into our human nature by developing godly habits. The first habit to develop is
the habit of recognizing God''s provision for us. We say, however, &quot;Oh, I
can''t afford it.&quot; One of the worst lies is wrapped up in that statement.
We talk as if our heavenly Father has cut us off without a penny! We think it
is a sign of true humility to say at the end of the day, &quot;Well, I just
barely got by today, but it was a severe struggle.&quot; And yet all of Almighty
God is ours in the Lord Jesus! And He will reach to the last grain of sand and
the remotest star to bless us if we will only obey Him. Does it really matter
that our circumstances are difficult? Why shouldn''t they be! If we give way to
self-pity and indulge in the luxury of misery, we remove God''s riches from our
lives and hinder others from entering into His provision. No sin is worse than
the sin of self-pity, because it removes God from the throne of our lives,
replacing Him with our own self-interests. It causes us to open our mouths only
to complain, and we simply become spiritual sponges --- always absorbing, never
giving, and never being satisfied. And there is nothing lovely or generous
about our lives.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Before
God becomes satisfied with us, He will take everything of our so-called wealth,
until we learn that He is our Source; as the psalmist said, &quot;All my
springs are in You&quot; (Psa 87:7</span>). If
the majesty, grace, and power of God are not being exhibited in us, God holds
us responsible. &quot;God is able to make all grace abound toward you, that you
. . . may have an abundance . . .&quot; (2Co 9:8</span>)
--- then learn to lavish the grace of God on others, generously giving of
yourself. Be marked and identified with God''s nature, and His blessing will
flow through you all the time.
