<b>The
Consecration of Spiritual Power

</b><span>(Gal 6:14)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>If
I dwell on the Cross of Christ, I do not simply become inwardly devout and
solely interested in my own holiness --- I become strongly focused on Jesus
Christ''s interests. Our Lord was not a recluse nor a fanatical holy man
practicing self-denial. He did not physically cut Himself off from society, but
He was inwardly disconnected all the time. He was not aloof, but He lived in another
world. In fact, He was so much in the common everyday world that the religious
people of His day accused Him of being a glutton and a drunkard. Yet our Lord
never allowed anything to interfere with His consecration of spiritual power.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>It
is not genuine consecration to think that we can refuse to be used of God now
in order to store up our spiritual power for later use. That is a hopeless
mistake. The Spirit of God has set a great many people free from their sin, yet
they are experiencing no fullness in their lives --- no true sense of freedom.
The kind of religious life we see around the world today is entirely different
from the vigorous holiness of the life of Jesus Christ. &quot;I do not pray
that You should take them out of the world, but that You should keep them from
the evil one&quot; (Joh 17:15</span>). We are
to be <i>in</i> the world but not <i>of</i> it --- to be separated internally,
not externally (Joh 17:16</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>We
must never allow anything to interfere with the consecration of our spiritual
power. Consecration (being dedicated to God''s service) is our part;
sanctification (being set apart from sin and being made holy) is God''s part.
We must make a deliberate determination to be interested only in what God is
interested. The way to make that determination, when faced with a perplexing
problem, is to ask yourself, &quot;Is this the kind of thing in which Jesus
Christ is interested, or is it something in which the spirit that is
diametrically opposed to Jesus is interested?&quot;
