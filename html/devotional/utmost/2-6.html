<b>Spiritual
Dejection

</b><span>(Luk 24:21)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Every
fact that the disciples stated was right, but the conclusions they drew from
those facts were wrong. Anything that has even a hint of dejection spiritually
is always wrong. If I am depressed or burdened, I am to blame, not God or
anyone else. Dejection stems from one of two sources --- I have either
satisfied a lust or I have not had it satisfied. In either case, dejection is
the result. <i>Lust</i> means &quot;I must have it at once.&quot; Spiritual
lust causes me to demand an answer from God, instead of seeking God Himself who
gives the answer. What have I been hoping or trusting God would do? Is today
&quot;the third day&quot; and He has still not done what I expected? Am I
therefore justified in being dejected and in blaming God? Whenever we insist
that God should give us an answer to prayer we are off track. The purpose of
prayer is that we get ahold of God, not of the answer. It is impossible to be
well physically and to be dejected, because dejection is a sign of sickness.
This is also true spiritually. Dejection spiritually is wrong, and we are
always to blame for it.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>We
look for visions from heaven and for earth-shaking events to see God''s power.
Even the fact that we are dejected is proof that we do this. Yet we never
realize that all the time God is at work in our everyday events and in the
people around us. If we will only obey, and do the task that He has placed
closest to us, we will see Him. One of the most amazing revelations of God
comes to us when we learn that it is in the everyday things of life that we
realize the magnificent deity of Jesus Christ.
