<b>Nothing
of the Old Life!

</b><span>(2Co 5:17)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Our
Lord never tolerates our prejudices --- He is directly opposed to them and puts
them to death. We tend to think that God has some special interest in our
particular prejudices, and are very sure that He will never deal with us as He
has to deal with others. We even say to ourselves, &quot;God has to deal with
other people in a very strict way, but of course He knows that my prejudices
are all right.&quot; But we must learn that God accepts nothing of the old
life! Instead of being on the side of our prejudices, He is deliberately
removing them from us. It is part of our moral education to see our prejudices
put to death by His providence, and to watch how He does it. God pays no
respect to anything we bring to Him. There is only one thing God wants of us,
and that is our unconditional surrender.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>When
we are born again, the Holy Spirit begins to work His new creation in us, and
there will come a time when there is nothing remaining of the old life. Our old
gloomy outlook disappears, as does our old attitude toward things, and
&quot;all things are of God&quot; (2Co 5:18</span>).
How are we going to get a life that has no lust, no self-interest, and is not
sensitive to the ridicule of others? How will we have the type of love that
&quot;is kind . . . is not provoked, [and] thinks no evil&quot;? (<span
>1Co 13:4-5</span>). The only way is by allowing nothing
of the old life to remain, and by having only simple, perfect trust in God ---
such a trust that we no longer want God''s blessings, but only want God
Himself. Have we come to the point where God can withdraw His blessings from us
without our trust in Him being affected? Once we truly see God at work, we will
never be concerned again about the things that happen, because we are actually
trusting in our Father in heaven, whom the world cannot see.
