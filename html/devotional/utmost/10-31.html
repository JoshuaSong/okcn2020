<b>The
Trial of Faith

</b><span>(Mat 17:20)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>We
have the idea that God rewards us for our faith, and it may be so in the
initial stages. But we do not earn anything through faith --- faith brings us
into the right relationship with God and gives Him His opportunity to work. Yet
God frequently has to knock the bottom out of your experience as His saint to
get you in direct contact with Himself. God wants you to understand that it is
a life of <i>faith,</i> not a life of emotional enjoyment of His blessings. The
beginning of your life of faith was very narrow and intense, centered around a
small amount of experience that had as much emotion as faith in it, and it was
full of light and sweetness. Then God withdrew His conscious blessings to teach
you to &quot;walk by faith&quot; (2Co 5:7</span>).
And you are worth much more to Him now than you were in your days of conscious
delight with your thrilling testimony.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Faith
by its very nature must be tested and tried. And the real trial of faith is not
that we find it difficult to trust God, but that God''s character must be
proven as trustworthy in our own minds. Faith being worked out into reality
must experience times of unbroken isolation. Never confuse the trial of faith
with the ordinary discipline of life, because a great deal of what we call the
trial of faith is the inevitable result of being alive. Faith, as the Bible
teaches it, is faith in God coming against everything that contradicts Him ---
a faith that says, &quot;I will remain true to God''s character whatever He may
do.&quot; The highest and the greatest expression of faith in the whole Bible
is --- &quot;Though He slay me, yet will I trust Him&quot; (<span
>Job 13:15</span>).
