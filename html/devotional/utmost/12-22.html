<b>The
Drawing of the Father

</b><span>(Joh 6:44)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>When
God begins to draw me to Himself, the problem of my will comes in immediately.
Will I react positively to the truth that God has revealed? Will I come to Him?
To discuss or deliberate over spiritual matters when God calls is inappropriate
and disrespectful to Him. When God speaks, never discuss it with anyone as if
to decide what your response may be (Gal 1:15-16</span>).
Belief is not the result of an intellectual act, but the result of an act of my
will whereby I deliberately commit myself. But will I commit, placing myself
completely and absolutely on God, and be willing to act solely on what He says?
If I will, I will find that I am grounded on reality as certain as God''s
throne.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>In
preaching the gospel, always focus on the matter of the will. Belief must come
from the <i>will</i> to believe. There must be a surrender of the will, not a
surrender to a persuasive or powerful argument. I must deliberately step out,
placing my faith in God and in His truth. And I must place no confidence in my
own works, but only in God. Trusting in my own mental understanding becomes a
hindrance to complete trust in God. I must be willing to ignore and leave my
feelings behind. I must <i>will</i> to believe. But this can never be
accomplished without my forceful, determined effort to separate myself from my old
ways of looking at things. I must surrender myself completely to God.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Everyone
has been created with the ability to reach out beyond his own grasp. But it is
God who draws me, and my relationship to Him in the first place is an inner,
personal one, not an intellectual one. I come into the relationship through the
miracle of God and through my own will to believe. Then I begin to get an
intelligent appreciation and understanding of the wonder of the transformation
in my life.
