<b>My
Life&amp;#146;s Spiritual Honor and Duty

</b><span>(Rom 1:14)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Paul
was overwhelmed with the sense of his indebtedness to Jesus Christ, and he
spent his life to express it. The greatest inspiration in Paul''s life was his
view of Jesus Christ as his spiritual creditor. Do I feel that same sense of
indebtedness to Christ regarding every unsaved soul? As a saint, my life''s
spiritual honor and duty is to fulfill my debt to Christ in relation to these
lost souls. Every tiny bit of my life that has value I owe to the redemption of
Jesus Christ. Am I doing anything to enable Him to bring His redemption into
evident reality in the lives of others? I will only be able to do this as the
Spirit of God works into me this sense of indebtedness.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>I
am not a superior person among other people --- I am a bondservant of the Lord
Jesus. Paul said, &quot;. . . you are not your own . . . you were bought at a
price . . .&quot;(1Co 6:19-20</span>). Paul
sold himself to Jesus Christ and he said, in effect, &quot;I am a debtor to
everyone on the face of the earth because of the gospel of Jesus; I am free
only that I may be an absolute bondservant of His.&quot; That is the
characteristic of a Christian''s life once this level of spiritual honor and
duty becomes real. Quit praying about yourself and spend your life for the sake
of others as the bondservant of Jesus. That is the true meaning of being broken
bread and poured-out wine in real life.
