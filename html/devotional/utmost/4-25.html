<b>&quot;Ready
in Season&quot;

</b><span>(2Ti 4:2)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Many
of us suffer from the unbalanced tendency to &quot;be ready&quot; only
&quot;out of season.&quot; The season does not refer to time; it refers to us.
This verse says, &quot;Preach the Word! Be ready in season and out of
season.&quot; In other words, we should &quot;be ready&quot; whether we feel
like it or not. If we do only what we feel inclined to do, some of us would
never do anything. There are some people who are totally unemployable in the
spiritual realm. They are spiritually feeble and weak, and they refuse to do
anything unless they are supernaturally inspired. The proof that our
relationship is right with God is that we do our best whether we feel inspired
or not.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>One
of the worst traps a Christian worker can fall into is to become obsessed with
his own exceptional moments of inspiration. When the Spirit of God gives you a
time of inspiration and insight, you tend to say, &quot;Now that I''ve
experienced this moment, I will always be like this for God.&quot; No, you will
not, and God will make sure of that. Those times are entirely the gift of God.
You cannot give them to yourself when you choose. If you say you will only be
at your best for God, as during those exceptional times, you actually become an
intolerable burden on Him. You will never do anything unless God keeps you
consciously aware of His inspiration to you at all times. If you make a god out
of your best moments, you will find that God will fade out of your life, never
to return until you are obedient in the work He has placed closest to you, and
until you have learned not to be obsessed with those exceptional moments He has
given you.
