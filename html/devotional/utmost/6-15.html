<br/><b>In
the matter of drudgery.</b>
Peter said in this passage that we have become &quot;partakers of the divine
nature&quot; and that we should now be &quot;giving all diligence,&quot;
concentrating on forming godly habits (2Pe 1:4-5</span>).
We are to &quot;add&quot; to our lives all that character means. No one is born
either naturally or supernaturally with character; it must be developed. Nor
are we born with habits --- we have to form godly habits on the basis of the
new life God has placed within us. We are not meant to be seen as God''s
perfect, bright-shining examples, but to be seen as the everyday essence of
ordinary life exhibiting the miracle of His grace. Drudgery is the test of
genuine character. The greatest hindrance in our spiritual life is that we will
only look for big things to do. Yet, &quot;Jesus . . . took a towel and . . .
began to wash the disciples'' feet . . .&quot; (Joh 13:3-5</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>We
all have those times when there are no flashes of light and no apparent thrill
to life, where we experience nothing but the daily routine with its common
everyday tasks. The routine of life is actually God''s way of saving us between
our times of great inspiration which come from Him. Don''t always expect God to
give you His thrilling moments, but learn to live in those common times of the
drudgery of life by the power of God.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>It
is difficult for us to do the &quot;adding&quot; that Peter mentioned here. We
say we do not expect God to take us to heaven on flowery beds of ease, and yet
we act as if we do! I must realize that my obedience even in the smallest
detail of life has all of the omnipotent power of the grace of God behind it.
If I will do my duty, not for duty''s sake but because I believe God is
engineering my circumstances, then at the very point of my obedience all of the
magnificent grace of God is mine through the glorious atonement by the Cross of
Christ.
