<b>Getting
There

</b><span>(Luk 18:22)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/><b>Where
our individual desire dies and sanctified surrender lives.</b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Trebuchet MS","sans-serif"'> One of the greatest
hindrances in coming to Jesus is the excuse of our own individual temperament.
We make our temperament and our natural desires barriers to coming to Jesus.
Yet the first thing we realize when we do come to Jesus is that He pays no
attention whatsoever to our natural desires. We have the idea that we can
dedicate our gifts to God. However, you cannot dedicate what is not yours.
There is actually only one thing you can dedicate to God, and that is your
right to yourself (Rom 12:1</span>). If you
will give God your right to yourself, He will make a holy experiment out of you
--- and His experiments always succeed. The one true mark of a saint of God is
the inner creativity that flows from being totally surrendered to Jesus Christ.
In the life of a saint there is this amazing Well, which is a continual Source
of original life. The Spirit of God is a Well of water springing up perpetually
fresh. A saint realizes that it is God who engineers his circumstances;
consequently there are no complaints, only unrestrained surrender to Jesus.
Never try to make your experience a principle for others, but allow God to be
as creative and original with others as He is with you.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>If
you abandon everything to Jesus, and come when He says, &quot;Come,&quot; then
He will continue to say, &quot;Come,&quot; through you. You will go out into
the world reproducing the echo of Christ''s &quot;Come.&quot; That is the
result in every soul who has abandoned all and come to Jesus.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Have
I come to Him? Will I come <i>now?</i>
