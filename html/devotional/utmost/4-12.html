<b>Complete
and Effective Dominion

</b><span>(Rom 6:9-11)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/><b>Co-Eternal
Life.</b>
Eternal life is the life which Jesus Christ exhibited on the human level. And
it is this same life, not simply a copy of it, which is made evident in our
mortal flesh when we are born again. Eternal life is not a gift from God;
eternal life is the gift <i>of God.</i> The energy and the power which was so
very evident in Jesus will be exhibited in us by an act of the absolute
sovereign grace of God, once we have made that complete and effective decision
about sin.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;You
shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you . . .&quot; (<span
>Act 1:8</span>) ---not power as a gift from the Holy
Spirit; the power is the Holy Spirit, not something that He gives us. The life
that was in Jesus becomes ours because of His Cross, once we make the decision
to be identified with Him. If it is difficult to get right with God, it is
because we refuse to make this moral decision about sin. But once we do decide,
the full life of God comes in immediately. Jesus came to give us an endless
supply of life ---&quot;. . . that you may be filled with all the fullness of
God&quot; (Eph 3:19</span>). Eternal life has
nothing to do with time. It is the life which Jesus lived when He was down
here, and the only Source of life is the Lord Jesus Christ.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Even
the weakest saint can experience the power of the deity of the Son of God, when
he is willing to &quot;let go.&quot; But any effort to &quot;hang on&quot; to
the least bit of our own power will only diminish the life of Jesus in us. We
have to keep letting go, and slowly, but surely, the great full life of God
will invade us, penetrating every part. Then Jesus will have complete and
effective dominion in us, and people will take notice that we have been with
Him.
