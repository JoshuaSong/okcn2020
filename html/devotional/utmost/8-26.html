<b>Are
You Ever Troubled?

</b><span>(Joh 14:27)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>There
are times in our lives when our peace is based simply on our own ignorance. But
when we are awakened to the realities of life, true inner peace is impossible
unless it is received from Jesus. When our Lord speaks peace, He creates peace,
because the words that He speaks are always &quot;spirit, and they are
life&quot; (Joh 6:63</span>). Have I ever
received what Jesus speaks? &quot;. . . <i>My peace I give to you</i> . .
.&quot; --- a peace that comes from looking into His face and fully
understanding and receiving His quiet contentment.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Are
you severely troubled right now? Are you afraid and confused by the waves and
the turbulence God sovereignly allows to enter your life? Have you left no
stone of your faith unturned, yet still not found any well of peace, joy, or
comfort? Does your life seem completely barren to you? Then look up and receive
the quiet contentment of the Lord Jesus. Reflecting His peace is proof that you
are right with God, because you are exhibiting the freedom to turn your mind to
Him. If you are not right with God, you can never turn your mind anywhere but
on yourself. Allowing anything to hide the face of Jesus Christ from you either
causes you to become troubled or gives you a false sense of security.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>With
regard to the problem that is pressing in on you right now, are you
&quot;looking unto Jesus&quot; (Heb 12:2</span>)
and receiving peace from Him? If so, He will be a gracious blessing of peace
exhibited in and through you. But if you only try to worry your way out of the
problem, you destroy His effectiveness in you, and you deserve whatever you
get. We become troubled because we have not been taking Him into account. When
a person confers with Jesus Christ, the confusion stops, because there is no
confusion in Him. Lay everything out before Him, and when you are faced with
difficulty, bereavement, and sorrow, listen to Him say, &quot;Let not your
heart be troubled . . .&quot; (Joh 14:27</span>).
