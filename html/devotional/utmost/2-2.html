<b>Becoming
the &quot;Filth of the World&quot;

</b><span>(1Co 4:13)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>These
words are not an exaggeration. The only reason they may not be true of us who
call ourselves ministers of the gospel is not that Paul forgot or misunderstood
the exact truth of them, but that we are too cautious and concerned about our
own desires to allow ourselves to become the refuse or &quot;filth of the
world.&quot; &quot;Fill up in my flesh what is lacking in the afflictions of
Christ . . .&quot; (Col 1:24</span>) is not
the result of the holiness of sanctification, but the evidence of consecration
--- being &quot;separated <i>to</i> the gospel of God . . .&quot; (<span
>Rom 1:1</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;Beloved,
do not think it strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you . .
.&quot; (1Pe 4:12</span>). If we do think the
things we encounter are strange, it is because we are fearful and cowardly. We
pay such close attention to our own interests and desires that we stay out of
the mire and say, &quot;I won''t submit; I won''t bow or bend.&quot; And you
don''t have to --- you can be saved by the &quot;skin of your teeth&quot; if you
like. You can refuse to let God count you as one who is &quot;separated to the
gospel . . . .&quot; Or you can say, &quot;I don''t care if I am treated like
''the filth of the world'' as long as the gospel is proclaimed.&quot; A true
servant of Jesus Christ is one who is willing to experience martyrdom for the
reality of the gospel of God. When a moral person is confronted with contempt,
immorality, disloyalty, or dishonesty, he is so repulsed by the offense that he
turns away and in despair closes his heart to the offender. But the miracle of the
redemptive reality of God is that the worst and the vilest offender can never
exhaust the depths of His love. Paul did not say that God separated him to show
what a wonderful man He could make of him, but <i>&quot;to reveal His Son in me</i>
. . .&quot; (Gal 1:16</span>).
