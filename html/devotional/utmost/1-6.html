<b>Intimate
With Jesus

</b><span>(Joh 14:9)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>&nbsp;These
words were not spoken as a rebuke, nor even with surprise; Jesus was
encouraging Philip to draw closer. Yet the last person we get intimate with is
Jesus. Before Pentecost the disciples knew Jesus as the One who gave them power
to conquer demons and to bring about a revival (Luk 10:18-20</span>).
It was a wonderful intimacy, but there was a much closer intimacy to come:
&quot;. . . I have called you friends . . .&quot; (Joh 15:15</span>).
True friendship is rare on earth. It means identifying with someone in thought,
heart, and spirit. The whole experience of life is designed to enable us to
enter into this closest relationship with Jesus Christ. We receive His
blessings and know His Word, but do we really know Him?

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Jesus
said, &quot;It is to your advantage that I go away . . .&quot; (<span
>Joh 16:7</span>). He left that relationship to lead
them even closer. It is a joy to Jesus when a disciple takes time to walk more
intimately with Him. The bearing of fruit is always shown in Scripture to be
the visible result of an intimate relationship with Jesus Christ (<span
>Joh 15:1-4</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Once
we get intimate with Jesus we are never lonely and we never lack for
understanding or compassion. We can continually pour out our hearts to Him
without being perceived as overly emotional or pitiful. The Christian who is
truly intimate with Jesus will never draw attention to himself but will only
show the evidence of a life where Jesus is completely in control. This is the
outcome of allowing Jesus to satisfy every area of life to its depth. The
picture resulting from such a life is that of the strong, calm balance that our
Lord gives to those who are intimate with Him.
