<b>The
Supreme Climb

</b><span>(Gen 22:2)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>A
person''s character determines how he interprets God''s will (<span
>Psa 18:25-26</span>). Abraham interpreted God''s
command to mean that he had to kill his son, and he could only leave this
traditional belief behind through the pain of a tremendous ordeal. God could
purify his faith in no other way. If we obey what God says according to our
sincere belief, God will break us from those traditional beliefs that
misrepresent Him. There are many such beliefs which must be removed --- for
example, that God removes a child because his mother loves him too much. That
is the devil''s lie and a travesty on the true nature of God! If the devil can
hinder us from taking the supreme climb and getting rid of our wrong
traditional beliefs about God, he will do so. But if we will stay true to God,
God will take us through an ordeal that will serve to bring us into a better
knowledge of Himself.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
great lesson to be learned from Abraham''s faith in God is that he was prepared
to do anything for God. He was there to obey God, no matter what contrary
belief of his might be violated by his obedience. Abraham was not devoted to
his own convictions or else he would have slain Isaac and said that the voice
of the angel was actually the voice of the devil. That is the attitude of a
fanatic. If you will remain true to God, God will lead you directly through
every barrier and right into the inner chamber of the knowledge of Himself. But
you must always be willing to come to the point of giving up your own
convictions and traditional beliefs. Don''t ask God to test you. Never declare
as Peter did that you are willing to do anything, even &quot;to go . . . both
to prison and to death&quot; (Luk 22:33</span>).
Abraham did not make any such statement --- he simply remained true to God, and
God purified his faith.
