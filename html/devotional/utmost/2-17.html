<b>Taking
the Initiative Against Despair

</b><span>(Mat 26:46)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>In
the Garden of Gethsemane, the disciples went to sleep when they should have
stayed awake, and once they realized what they had done it produced despair.
The sense of having done something irreversible tends to make us despair. We
say, &quot;Well, it''s all over and ruined now; what''s the point in trying
anymore.&quot; If we think this kind of despair is an exception, we are
mistaken. It is a very ordinary human experience. Whenever we realize we have
not taken advantage of a magnificent opportunity, we are apt to sink into
despair. But Jesus comes and lovingly says to us, in essence, &quot;Sleep on
now. That opportunity is lost forever and you can''t change that. But get up,
and let''s go on to the next thing.&quot; In other words, let the past sleep,
but let it sleep in the sweet embrace of Christ, and let us go on into the invincible
future with Him.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>There
will be experiences like this in each of our lives. We will have times of
despair caused by real events in our lives, and we will be unable to lift
ourselves out of them. The disciples, in this instance, had done a downright
unthinkable thing --- they had gone to sleep instead of watching with Jesus.
But our Lord came to them taking the spiritual initiative against their despair
and said, in effect, &quot;Get up, and do the next thing.&quot; If we are
inspired by God, what is the next thing? It is to trust Him absolutely and to
pray on the basis of His redemption.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Never
let the sense of past failure defeat your next step.
