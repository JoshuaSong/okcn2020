<b>&quot;It
Is the Lord!&quot;

</b><span>(Joh 20:28)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>&nbsp;Jesus
said to her, ''Give Me a drink'' &quot; (Joh 4:7</span>).
How many of us are expecting Jesus Christ to quench our thirst when we should
be satisfying Him! We should be pouring out our lives, investing our total
beings, not drawing on Him to satisfy us. &quot;You shall be witnesses to Me .
. .&quot; (Act 1:8</span>). That means lives
of pure, uncompromising, and unrestrained devotion to the Lord Jesus, which
will be satisfying to Him wherever He may send us.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Beware
of anything that competes with your loyalty to Jesus Christ. The greatest
competitor of true devotion to Jesus is the service we do for Him. It is easier
to serve than to pour out our lives completely for Him. The goal of the call of
God is His satisfaction, not simply that we should do something <i>for</i> Him.
We are not sent to do battle for God, but to be used by God in His battles. Are
we more devoted to service than we are to Jesus Christ Himself?
