<b>The
Habit of Keeping a Clear Conscience

</b><span>(Act 24:16)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>God''s
commands to us are actually given to the life of His Son in us. Consequently,
to our human nature in which God''s Son has been formed (<span
>Gal 4:19</span>), His commands are difficult. But they
become divinely easy once we obey.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Conscience
is that ability within me that attaches itself to the highest standard I know,
and then continually reminds me of what that standard demands that I do. It is
the eye of the soul which looks out either toward God or toward what we regard
as the highest standard. This explains why conscience is different in different
people. If I am in the habit of continually holding God''s standard in front of
me, my conscience will always direct me to God''s perfect law and indicate what
I should do. The question is, will I obey? I have to make an effort to keep my
conscience so sensitive that I can live without any offense toward anyone. I
should be living in such perfect harmony with God''s Son that the spirit of my
mind is being renewed through every circumstance of life, and that I may be
able to quickly &quot;prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will
of God&quot; (Rom 12:2</span>; also see <span
>Eph 4:23</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>God
always instructs us down to the last detail. Is my ear sensitive enough to hear
even the softest whisper of the Spirit, so that I know what I should do?
&quot;Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God . . .&quot; (<span
>Eph 4:30</span>). He does not speak with a voice like
thunder --- His voice is so gentle that it is easy for us to ignore. And the
only thing that keeps our conscience sensitive to Him is the habit of being
open to God on the inside. When you begin to debate, stop immediately. Don''t
ask, &quot;Why can''t I do this?&quot; You are on the wrong track. There is no
debating possible once your conscience speaks. Whatever it is --- drop it, and
see that you keep your inner vision clear.
