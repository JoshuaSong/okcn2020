<b>The
Cross in Prayer

</b><span>(Joh 16:26)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>We
too often think of the Cross of Christ as something we have to get through, yet
we get <i>through</i> for the purpose of getting <i>into</i> it. The Cross
represents only one thing for us --- complete, entire, absolute identification
with the Lord Jesus Christand there is nothing in which this identification is
more real to us than in prayer.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;Your
Father knows the things you have need of before you ask Him&quot; (<span
>Mat 6:8</span>). Then why should we ask? The point of
prayer is not to get answers from God, but to have perfect and complete oneness
with Him. If we pray only because we want answers, we will become irritated and
angry with God. We receive an answer every time we pray, but it does not
alwayscome in the way we expect, and our spiritual irritation shows our refusal
to identify ourselves truly with our Lord in prayer. We are not here to prove
that God answers prayer, but to be living trophies of God''s grace.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;.
. . I do not say to you that I shall pray the Father for you; for the Father
Himself loves you . . .&quot; (Joh 16:26-27</span>).
Have you reached such a level of intimacy with God that the only thing that can
account for your prayer life is that it has become one with the prayer life of
Jesus Christ? Has our Lord exchanged your life with His vital life? If so, then
&quot;in that day&quot; you will be so closely identified with Jesus that there
will be no distinction.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>When
prayer seems to be unanswered, beware of trying to place the blame on someone
else. That is always a trap of Satan. When you seem to have no answer, there is
always a reason --- God uses these times to give you deep personal instruction,
and it is not for anyone else but you.
