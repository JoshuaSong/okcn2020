<b>The
Way to Knowledge

</b><span>(Joh 7:17)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>The
golden rule to follow to obtain spiritual understanding is not one of
intellectual pursuit, but one of obedience. If a person wants scientific
knowledge, then intellectual curiosity must be his guide. But if he desires
knowledge and insight into the teachings of Jesus Christ, he can only obtain it
through obedience. If spiritual things seem dark and hidden to me, then I can
be sure that there is a point of disobedience somewhere in my life.
Intellectual darkness is the result of ignorance, but spiritual darkness is the
result of something that I do not intend to obey.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>No
one ever receives a word from God without instantly being put to the test
regarding it. We disobey and then wonder why we are not growing spiritually.
Jesus said, &quot;If you bring your gift to the altar, and there remember that
your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar,
and go your way. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer
your gift&quot; (Mat 5:23-24</span>). He is
saying, in essence, &quot;Don''t say another word to me; first be obedient by
making things right.&quot; The teachings of Jesus hit us where we live. We
cannot stand as impostors before Him for even one second. He instructs us down
to the very last detail. The Spirit of God uncovers our spirit of
self-vindication and makes us sensitive to things that we have never even
thought of before.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>When
Jesus drives something home to you through His Word, don''t try to evade it. If
you do, you will become a religious impostor. Examine the things you tend
simply to shrug your shoulders about, and where you have refused to be
obedient, and you will know why you are not growing spiritually. As Jesus said,
<i>&quot;First</i> . . . <i>go</i> . . . .&quot; Even at the risk of being
thought of as fanatical, you must obey what God tells you.
