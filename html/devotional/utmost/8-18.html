<b>Have
You Ever Been Speechless with Sorrow?

</b><span>(Luk 18:23)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>The
rich young ruler went away from Jesus speechless with sorrow, having nothing to
say in response to Jesus'' words. He had no doubt about what Jesus had said or
what it meant, and it produced in him a sorrow with no words with which to
respond. Have you ever been there? Has God''s Word ever come to you, pointing
out an area of your life, requiring you to yield it to Him? Maybe He has
pointed out certain personal qualities, desires, and interests, or possibly
relationships of your heart and mind. If so, then you have often been
speechless with sorrow. The Lord will not go after you, and He will not plead
with you. But every time He meets you at the place where He has pointed, He
will simply repeat His words, saying, &quot;If you really mean what you say,
these are the conditions.&quot;

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;Sell
all that you have . . .&quot; (Luk 18:22</span>).
In other words, rid yourself before God of everything that might be considered
a possession until you are a mere conscious human being standing before Him,
and then give God that. That is where the battle is truly fought --- in the
realm of your will before God. Are you more devoted to your idea of what Jesus
wants than to Jesus Himself? If so, you are likely to hear one of His harsh and
unyielding statements that will produce sorrow in you. What Jesus says <i>is</i>
difficult --- it is only easy when it is heard by those who have His nature in
them. Beware of allowing anything to soften the hard words of Jesus Christ.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>I
can be so rich in my own poverty, or in the awareness of the fact that I am
nobody, that I will never be a disciple of Jesus. Or I can be so rich in the
awareness that I am somebody that I will never be a disciple. Am I willing to
be destitute and poor even in my sense of awareness of my destitution and
poverty? If not, that is why I become discouraged. Discouragement is
disillusioned self-love, and self-love may be love for my devotion to Jesus ---
not love for Jesus Himself.
