<b>Suffering
Afflictions and Going the Second Mile

</b><span>(Mat 5:39)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>This
verse reveals the humiliation of being a Christian. In the natural realm, if a
person does not hit back, it is because he is a coward. But in the spiritual
realm, it is the very evidence of the Son of God in him if he does not hit
back. When you are insulted, you must not only not resent it, but you must make
it an opportunity to exhibit the Son of God in your life. And you cannot
imitate the nature of Jesus --- it is either in you or it is not. A personal
insult becomes an opportunity for a saint to reveal the incredible sweetness of
the Lord Jesus.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
teaching of the Sermon on the Mount is not, &quot;Do your duty,&quot; but is,
in effect, &quot;Do what is not your duty.&quot; It is not your duty to go the
second mile, or to turn the other cheek, but Jesus said that if we are His
disciples, we will always do these things. We will not say, &quot;Oh well, I
just can''t do any more, and I''ve been so misrepresented and
misunderstood.&quot; Every time I insist on having my own rights, I hurt the
Son of God, while in fact I can prevent Jesus from being hurt if I will take
the blow myself. That is the real meaning of filling &quot;up in my flesh what
is lacking in the afflictions of Christ . . .&quot; (<span style='color:
black'>Col 1:24</span>). A disciple realizes that it is his Lord''s honor
that is at stake in his life, not his own honor.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Never
look for righteousness in the other person, but never cease to be righteous
yourself. We are always looking for justice, yet the essence of the teaching of
the Sermon on the Mount is --- Never look for justice, but never cease to give
it.
