<b>Leave
Room for God

</b><span>(Gal 1:15)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>&nbsp;As
servants of God, we must learn to make room for Him --- to give God &quot;elbow
room.&quot; We plan and figure and predict that this or that will happen, but
we forget to make room for God to come in as He chooses. Would we be surprised
if God came into our meeting or into our preaching in a way we had never
expected Him to come? Do not look for God to come in a particular way, but <i>do
look for Him.</i> The way to make room for Him is to expect Him to come, but
not in a certain way. No matter how well we may know God, the great lesson to
learn is that He may break in at any minute. We tend to overlook this element
of surprise, yet God never works in any other way. Suddenly --- God meets our
life --- &quot;. . . when it pleased God . . . .&quot;

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Keep
your life so constantly in touch with God that His surprising power can break
through at any point. Live in a constant state of expectancy, and leave room
for God to come in as He decides.
