<b>Are
You Ready To Be Poured Out As an Offering?

</b><span>(Phi 2:17)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Are
you willing to sacrifice yourself for the work of another believer --- to pour
out your life sacrificially for the ministry and faith of others? Or do you
say, &quot;I am not willing to be poured out right now, and I don''t want God
to tell me how to serve Him. I want to choose the place of my own sacrifice.
And I want to have certain people watching me and saying, ''Well done.'' &quot;

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>It
is one thing to follow God''s way of service if you are regarded as a hero, but
quite another thing if the road marked out for you by God requires becoming a
&quot;doormat&quot; under other people''s feet. God''s purpose may be to teach
you to say, &quot;I know how to be abased . . .&quot; (<span
>Phi 4:12</span>). Are you ready to be sacrificed like
that? Are you ready to be less than a mere drop in the bucket --- to be so
totally insignificant that no one remembers you even if they think of those you
served? Are you willing to give and be poured out until you are used up and
exhausted --- not seeking to be ministered to, but to minister? Some saints
cannot do menial work while maintaining a saintly attitude, because they feel
such service is beneath their dignity.
