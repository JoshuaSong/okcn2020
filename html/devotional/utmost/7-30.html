<b>The
Teaching of Disillusionment

</b><span>(Joh 2:24-25)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Disillusionment
means having no more misconceptions, false impressions, and false judgments in
life; it means being free from these deceptions. However, though no longer
deceived, our experience of disillusionment may actually leave us cynical and
overly critical in our judgment of others. But the disillusionment that comes
from God brings us to the point where we see people as they really are, yet
without any cynicism or any stinging and bitter criticism. Many of the things
in life that inflict the greatest injury, grief, or pain, stem from the fact
that we suffer from illusions. We are not true to one another as <i>facts,</i>
seeing each other as we really are; we are only true to our misconceived <i>ideas</i>
of one another. According to our thinking, everything is either delightful and
good, or it is evil, malicious, and cowardly.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Refusing
to be disillusioned is the cause of much of the suffering of human life. And
this is how that suffering happens --- if we love someone, but do not love God,
we demand total perfection and righteousness from that person, and when we do
not get it we become cruel and vindictive; yet we are demanding of a human
being something which he or she cannot possibly give. There is only one Being
who can completely satisfy to the absolute depth of the hurting human heart,
and that is the Lord Jesus Christ. Our Lord is so obviously uncompromising with
regard to every human relationship because He knows that every relationship
that is not based on faithfulness to Himself will end in disaster. Our Lord
trusted no one, and never placed His faith in people, yet He was never
suspicious or bitter. Our Lord''s confidence in God, and in what God''s grace
could do for anyone, was so perfect that He never despaired, never giving up
hope for any person. If our trust is placed in human beings, we will end up
despairing of everyone.
