<b>Vicarious
Intercession

</b><span>(Heb 10:19)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Beware
of thinking that intercession means bringing our own personal sympathies and
concerns into the presence of God, and then demanding that He do whatever we
ask. Our ability to approach God is due entirely to the vicarious, or
substitutionary, identification of our Lord with sin. We have &quot;boldness to
enter the Holiest <i>by the blood of Jesus.&quot;</i>

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Spiritual
stubbornness is the most effective hindrance to intercession, because it is
based on a sympathetic &quot;understanding&quot; of things we see in ourselves
and others that we think needs no atonement. We have the idea that there are
certain good and virtuous things in each of us that do not need to be based on
the atonement by the Cross of Christ. Just the sluggishness and lack of
interest produced by this kind of thinking makes us unable to intercede. We do
not identify ourselves with God''s interests and concerns for others, and we
get irritated with Him. Yet we are always ready with our own ideas, and our
intercession becomes only the glorification of our own natural sympathies. We
have to realize that the identification of Jesus with sin means a radical
change of all of our sympathies and interests. Vicarious intercession means
that we deliberately substitute God''s interests in others for our natural
sympathy with them.

<br/>Am
I stubborn or substituted? Am I spoiled or complete in my relationship to God?
Am I irritable or spiritual? Am I determined to have my own way or determined
to be identified with Him?
