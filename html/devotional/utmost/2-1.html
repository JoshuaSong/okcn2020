<b>The
Compelling Force of the Call

</b><span>(1Co 9:16)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Beware
of refusing to hear the call of God. Everyone who is saved is called to testify
to the fact of his salvation. That, however, is not the same as the call to
preach, but is merely an illustration which can be used in preaching. In this
verse, Paul was referring to the stinging pains produced in him by the
compelling force of the call to preach the gospel. Never try to apply what Paul
said regarding the call to preach to those souls who are being called to God
for salvation. There is nothing easier than getting saved, because it is solely
God''s sovereign work --- &quot;Look to Me, and be saved . . .&quot; (<span
>Isa 45:22</span>). Our Lord never requires the same
conditions for discipleship that he requires for salvation. We are condemned to
salvation through the Cross of Christ. But discipleship has an option with it
--- <i>&quot;If</i> anyone . . .&quot; (Luk 14:26</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Paul''s
words have to do with our being made servants of Jesus Christ, and our
permission is never asked as to what we will do or where we will go. God makes
us as broken bread and poured-out wine to please Himself. To be &quot;separated
to the gospel&quot; means being able to hear the call of God (<span
>Rom 1:1</span>). Once someone begins to hear that call,
a suffering worthy of the name of Christ is produced. Suddenly, every ambition,
every desire of life, and every outlook is completely blotted out and
extinguished. Only one thing remains --- &quot;. . . <i>separated to the gospel</i>
. . . .&quot; Woe be to the soul who tries to head in any other direction once
that call has come to him. The Bible Training College exists so that each of
you may know whether or not God has a man or woman here who truly cares about
proclaiming His gospel and to see if God grips you for this purpose. Beware of
competing calls once the call of God grips you.
