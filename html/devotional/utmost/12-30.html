<b>&quot;And
Every Virtue We Possess&quot;

</b><span>(Psa 87:7)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Our
Lord never &quot;patches up&quot; our natural virtues, that is, our natural
traits, qualities, or characteristics. He completely remakes a person on the
inside ---&quot;. . . put on the new man . . .&quot; (<span
>Eph 4:24</span>). In other words, see that your natural
human life is putting on all that is in keeping with the new life. The life God
places within us develops its own new virtues, not the virtues of the seed of
Adam, but of Jesus Christ. Once God has begun the process of sanctification in
your life, watch and see how God causes your confidence in your own natural
virtues and power to wither away. He will continue until you learn to draw your
life from the reservoir of the resurrection life of Jesus. Thank God if you are
going through this drying-up experience!

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
sign that God is at work in us is that He is destroying our confidence in the
natural virtues, because they are not promises of what we are going to be, but
only a wasted reminder of what God created man to be. We want to cling to our
natural virtues, while all the time God is trying to get us in contact with the
life of Jesus Christ --- a life that can never be described in terms of natural
virtues. It is the saddest thing to see people who are trying to serve God
depending on that which the grace of God never gave them. They are depending
solely on what they have by virtue of heredity. God does not take our natural
virtues and transform them, because our natural virtues could never even come
close to what Jesus Christ wants. No natural love, no natural patience, no
natural purity can ever come up to His demands. But as we bring every part of
our natural bodily life into harmony with the new life God has placed within
us, He will exhibit in us the virtues that were characteristic of the Lord
Jesus.

<br/>And
every virtue we possess 

<br/>Is
His alone.
