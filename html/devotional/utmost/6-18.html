<b>Keep
Recognizing Jesus

</b><span>(Mat 14:29-30)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>The
wind really was boisterous and the waves really were high, but Peter didn''t
see them at first. He didn''t consider them at all; he simply recognized his
Lord, stepped out in recognition of Him, and &quot;walked on the water.&quot;
Then he began to take those things around him into account, and instantly, down
he went. Why couldn''t our Lord have enabled him to walk at the bottom of the
waves, as well as on top of them? He could have, yet neither could be done
without Peter''s continuing recognition of the Lord Jesus.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>We
step right out with recognition of God in some things, then self-consideration
enters our lives and down we go. If you are truly recognizing your Lord, you
have no business being concerned about how and where He engineers your
circumstances. The things surrounding you <i>are</i> real, but when you look at
them you are immediately overwhelmed, and even unable to recognize Jesus. Then
comes His rebuke, &quot;. . . why did you doubt?&quot; (<span
>Mat 14:31</span>). Let your actual circumstances be
what they may, but keep recognizing Jesus, maintaining complete reliance upon
Him.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>If
you debate for even one second when God has spoken, it is all over for you.
Never start to say, &quot;Well, I wonder if He really did speak to me?&quot; Be
reckless immediately --- totally unrestrained and willing to risk everything
--- by casting your all upon Him. You do not know when His voice will come to
you, but whenever the realization of God comes, even in the faintest way
imaginable, be determined to recklessly abandon yourself, surrendering
everything to Him. It is only through abandonment of yourself and your
circumstances that you will recognize Him. You will only recognize His voice
more clearly through recklessness --- being willing to risk your all.
