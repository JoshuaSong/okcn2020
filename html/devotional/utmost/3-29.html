<b>Our
Lord''s Surprise Visits

</b><span>(Luk 12:40)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>A
Christian worker''s greatest need is a readiness to face Jesus Christ at any
and every turn. This is not easy, no matter what our experience has been. This
battle is not against sin, difficulties, or circumstances, but against being so
absorbed in our service to Jesus Christ that we are not ready to face Jesus
Himself at every turn. The greatest need is not facing our beliefs or
doctrines, or even facing the question of whether or not we are of any use to
Him, but the need is to face <i>Him.</i>

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Jesus
rarely comes where we expect Him; He appears where we least expect Him, and
always in the most illogical situations. The only way a servant can remain true
to God is to be ready for the Lord''s surprise visits. This readiness will not
be brought about by service, but through intense spiritual reality, expecting
Jesus Christ at every turn. This sense of expectation will give our life the
attitude of childlike wonder He wants it to have. If we are going to be ready
for Jesus Christ, we have to stop being religious. In other words, we must stop
using religion as if it were some kind of a lofty lifestyle --- we must be
spiritually real.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>If
you are avoiding the call of the religious thinking of today''s world, and
instead are &quot;looking unto Jesus&quot; (Heb 12:2</span>),
setting your heart on what He wants, and thinking His thoughts, you will be
considered impractical and a daydreamer. But when He suddenly appears in the
work of the heat of the day, you will be the only one who is ready. You should
trust no one, and even ignore the finest saint on earth if he blocks your sight
of Jesus Christ.
