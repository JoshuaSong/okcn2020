<b>Experience
or God''s Revealed Truth?

</b><span>(1Co 2:12)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>My
experience is not what makes redemption real --- redemption <i>is</i> reality.
Redemption has no real meaning for me until it is worked out through my
conscious life. When I am born again, the Spirit of God takes me beyond myself
and my experiences, and identifies me with Jesus Christ. If I am left only with
my personal experiences, I am left with something not produced by redemption.
But experiences produced by redemption prove themselves by leading me beyond
myself, to the point of no longer paying any attention to experiences as the
basis of reality. Instead, I see that only the reality itself produced the
experiences. My experiences are not worth anything unless they keep me at the
Source of truth --- Jesus Christ.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>If
you try to hold back the Holy Spirit within you, with the desire of producing
more inner spiritual experiences, you will find that He will break the hold and
take you again to the historic Christ. Never support an experience which does
not have God as its Source and faith in God as its result. If you do, your
experience is anti-Christian, no matter what visions or insights you may have
had. Is Jesus Christ Lord of your experiences, or do you place your experiences
above Him? Is any experience dearer to you than your Lord? You must allow Him
to be Lord over you, and pay no attention to any experience over which He is
not Lord. Then there will come a time when God will make you impatient with
your own experience, and you can truthfully say, &quot;I do not care what I
experience --- I am sure of Him!&quot;

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Be
relentless and hard on yourself if you are in the habit of talking about the
experiences you have had. Faith based on experience is not faith; faith based
on God''s revealed truth is the only faith there is.
