<b>&quot;Will
You Lay Down Your Life?&quot;

</b><span>(Joh 15:13, Joh 15:15)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Jesus
does not ask me to die for Him, but to lay down my life for Him. Peter said to
the Lord, &quot;I will lay down my life for Your sake,&quot; and he meant it (<span
>Joh 13:37</span>). He had a magnificent sense of the
heroic. For us to be incapable of making this same statement Peter made would
be a bad thing --- our sense of duty is only fully realized through our sense
of heroism. Has the Lord ever asked you, &quot;Will you lay down your life for
My sake?&quot; (Joh 13:38</span>). It is much
easier to die than to lay down your life day in and day out with the sense of
the high calling of God. We are not made for the bright-shining moments of
life, but we have to walk in the light of them in our everyday ways. There was
only one bright-shining moment in the life of Jesus, and that was on the Mount
of Transfiguration. It was there that He emptied Himself of His glory for the
second time, and then came down into the demon-possessed valley (<span
>Mar 9:1-29</span>). For thirty-three years Jesus laid
down His life to do the will of His Father. &quot;By this we know love, because
He laid down His life for us. And we also ought to lay down our lives for the
brethren&quot; (1Jo 3:16</span>). Yet it is
contrary to our human nature to do so.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>If
I am a friend of Jesus, I must deliberately and carefully lay down my life for
Him. It is a difficult thing to do, and thank God that it is. Salvation is easy
for us, because it cost God so much. But the exhibiting of salvation in my life
is difficult. God saves a person, fills him with the Holy Spirit, and then
says, in effect, &quot;Now you work it out in your life, and be faithful to Me,
even though the nature of everything around you is to cause you to be
unfaithful.&quot; And Jesus says to us, &quot;. . . I have called you friends.
. . .&quot; Remain faithful to your Friend, and remember that His honor is at
stake in your bodily life.
