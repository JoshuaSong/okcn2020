<b>God''s
Assurance

</b><span>(Heb 13:5-6)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>My
assurance is to be built upon God''s assurance to me. God says, &quot;I will
never leave you,&quot; so that then I &quot;may boldly say, ''The Lord is my
helper; I will not fear'' &quot; (Heb 13:5-6</span>).
In other words, I will not be obsessed with apprehension. This does not mean
that I will not be tempted to fear, but I will remember God''s words of
assurance. I will be full of courage, like a child who strives to reach the
standard his father has set for him. The faith of many people begins to falter
when apprehensions enter their thinking, and they forget the meaning of God''s
assurance --- they forget to take a deep spiritual breath. The only way to
remove the fear from our lives is to listen to God''s assurance to us.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>What
are you fearing? Whatever it may be, you are not a coward about it --- you are
determined to face it, yet you still have a feeling of fear. When it seems that
there is nothing and no one to help you, say to yourself, &quot;But ''The Lord
is my helper'' this very moment, even in my present circumstance.&quot; Are you
learning to listen to God before you speak, or are you saying things and then
trying to make God''s Word fit what you have said? Take hold of the Father''s
assurance, and then say with strong courage, &quot;I will not fear.&quot; It
does not matter what evil or wrong may be in our way, because &quot;He Himself
has said, ''I will never leave you . . . .'' &quot;

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Human
frailty is another thing that gets between God''s words of assurance and our
own words and thoughts. When we realize how feeble we are in facing
difficulties, the difficulties become like giants, we become like grasshoppers,
and God seems to be nonexistent. But remember God''s assurance to us --- <i>&quot;I
will never . . . forsake you.&quot;</i> Have we learned to sing after hearing
God''s keynote? Are we continually filled with enough courage to say, &quot;The
Lord is my helper,&quot; or are we yielding to fear?
