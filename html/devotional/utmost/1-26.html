<b>Look
Again and Think

</b><span>(Mat 6:25)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>&nbsp;A
warning which needs to be repeated is that &quot;the cares of this world and
the deceitfulness of riches,&quot; and the lust for other things, will choke
out the life of God in us (Mat 13:22</span>).
We are never free from the recurring waves of this invasion. If the frontline
of attack is not about clothes and food, it may be about money or the lack of
money; or friends or lack of friends; or the line may be drawn over difficult
circumstances. It is one steady invasion, and these things will come in like a
flood, unless we allow the Spirit of God to raise up the banner against it.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;I
say to you, do not worry about your life . . . .&quot; Our Lord says to be
careful only about one thing --- our relationship to Him. But our common sense
shouts loudly and says, &quot;That is absurd, I <i>must</i> consider how I am
going to live, and I <i>must</i> consider what I am going to eat and
drink.&quot; Jesus says you must not. Beware of allowing yourself to think that
He says this while not understanding your circumstances. Jesus Christ knows our
circumstances better than we do, and He says we must not think about these
things to the point where they become the primary concern of our life. Whenever
there are competing concerns in your life, be sure you always put your
relationship to God first.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;Sufficient
for the day is its own trouble&quot; (Mat 6:34</span>).
How much trouble has begun to threaten you today? What kind of mean little
demons have been looking into your life and saying, &quot;What are your plans
for next month --- or next summer?&quot; Jesus tells us not to worry about any
of these things. Look again and think. Keep your mind on the &quot;much
more&quot; of your heavenly Father (Mat 6:30</span>).
