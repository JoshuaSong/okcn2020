<b>Being
an Example of His Message

</b><span>(2Ti 4:2)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>We
are not saved only to be instruments for God, but to be His sons and daughters.
He does not turn us into spiritual agents but into spiritual messengers, and
the message must be a part of us. The Son of God was His own message ---
&quot;The words that I speak to you are spirit, and they are life&quot; (<span
>Joh 6:63</span>). As His disciples, our lives must be a
holy example of the reality of our message. Even the natural heart of the
unsaved will serve if called upon to do so, but it takes a heart broken by
conviction of sin, baptized by the Holy Spirit, and crushed into submission to
God''s purpose to make a person''s life a holy example of God''s message.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>There
is a difference between giving a testimony and preaching. A preacher is someone
who has received the call of God and is determined to use all his energy to
proclaim God''s truth. God takes us beyond our own aspirations and ideas for
our lives, and molds and shapes us for His purpose, just as He worked in the
disciples'' lives after Pentecost. The purpose of Pentecost was not to teach
the disciples something, but to make them the incarnation of what they preached
so that they would literally become God''s message in the flesh. &quot;. . .
you shall be witnesses to Me . . .&quot; (Act 1:8</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Allow
God to have complete liberty in your life when you speak. Before God''s message
can liberate other people, His liberation must first be real in you. Gather
your material carefully, and then allow God to &quot;set your words on
fire&quot; for His glory.
