<b>The
Unchanging Law of Judgment

</b><span>(Mat 7:2)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>This
statement is not some haphazard theory, but it is an eternal law of God.
Whatever judgment you give will be the very way you are judged. There is a
difference between retaliation and retribution. Jesus said that the basis of
life is retribution --- &quot;with the measure you use, it will be measured
back to you.&quot; If you have been shrewd in finding out the shortcomings of
others, remember that will be exactly how you will be measured. The way you pay
is the way life will pay you back. This eternal law works from God''s throne
down to us (Psa 18:25-26</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>(<span
>Rom 2:1</span>) applies it in even a more definite way
by saying that the one who criticizes another is guilty of the very same thing.
God looks not only at the act itself, but also at the possibility of committing
it, which He sees by looking at our hearts. To begin with, we do not believe
the statements of the Bible. For instance, do we really believe the statement
that says we criticize in others the very things we are guilty of ourselves?
The reason we see hypocrisy, deceit, and a lack of genuineness in others is
that they are all in our own hearts. The greatest characteristic of a saint is
humility, as evidenced by being able to say honestly and humbly, &quot;Yes, all
those, as well as other evils, would have been exhibited in me if it were not
for the grace of God. Therefore, I have no right to judge.&quot;

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Jesus
said, &quot;Judge not, that you be not judged&quot; (<span style='color:
black'>Mat 7:1</span>). He went on to say, in effect, &quot;If you do
judge, you will be judged in exactly the same way.&quot; Who of us would dare
to stand before God and say, &quot;My God, judge me as I have judged
others&quot;? We have judged others as sinners --- if God should judge us in
the same way, we would be condemned to hell. Yet God judges us on the basis of
the miraculous atonement by the Cross of Christ.
