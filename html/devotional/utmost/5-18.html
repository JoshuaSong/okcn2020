<b>Living
Simply --- Yet Focused

</b><span>(Mat 6:26-28)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Consider
the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin ---
&quot;they simply are! Think of the sea, the air, the sun, the stars, and the
moon --- all of these simply <i>are</i> as well --- yet what a ministry and
service they render on our behalf! So often we impair God''s designed
influence, which He desires to exhibit through us, because of our own conscious
efforts to be consistent and useful. Jesus said there is only one way to
develop and grow spiritually, and that is through focusing and concentrating on
God. In essence, Jesus was saying, &quot;Do not worry about being of use to
others; simply believe on Me.&quot; In other words, pay attention to the
Source, and out of you &quot;will flow rivers of living water&quot; (<span
>Joh 7:38</span>). We cannot discover the source of our
natural life through common sense and reasoning, and Jesus is teaching here
that growth in our spiritual life comes not from focusing directly on it, but
from concentrating on our Father in heaven. Our heavenly Father knows our
circumstances, and if we will stay focused on Him, instead of our
circumstances, we will grow spiritually --- just as &quot;the lilies of the
field.&quot;

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
people who influence us the most are not those who detain us with their
continual talk, but those who live their lives like the stars in the sky and
&quot;the lilies of the field --- &quot;simply and unaffectedly. Those are the
lives that mold and shape us.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>If
you want to be of use to God, maintain the proper relationship with Jesus
Christ by staying focused on Him, and He will make use of you every minute you
live --- yet you will be unaware, on the conscious level of your life, that you
are being used of Him.
