<b>Do
It Yourself

</b><span>(2Co 10:5)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/><b>Determinedly
Discipline Other Things.</b>
This is another difficult aspect of the strenuous nature of sainthood. Paul
said, according to the Moffatt translation of this verse, &quot;. . . I take
every project prisoner to make it obey Christ . . . .&quot; So much Christian
work today has never been disciplined, but has simply come into being by
impulse! In our Lord''s life every project was disciplined to the will of His
Father. There was never the slightest tendency to follow the impulse of His own
will as distinct from His Father''s will --- &quot;the Son can do nothing of
Himself . . . &quot; (Joh 5:19</span>). Then
compare this with what we do --- we take &quot;every thought&quot; or project
that comes to us by impulse and jump into action immediately, instead of
imprisoning and disciplining ourselves to obey Christ.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Practical
work for Christians is greatly overemphasized today, and the saints who are
&quot;bringing every thought [and project] into captivity&quot; are criticized
and told that they are not determined, and that they lack zeal for God or zeal
for the souls of others. But true determination and zeal are found in obeying
God, not in the inclination to serve Him that arises from our own undisciplined
human nature. It is inconceivable, but true nevertheless, that saints are not
&quot;bringing every thought [and project] into captivity,&quot; but are simply
doing work for God that has been instigated by their own human nature, and has
not been made spiritual through determined discipline.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>We
have a tendency to forget that a person is not only committed to Jesus Christ
for salvation, but is also committed, responsible, and accountable to Jesus
Christ''s view of God, the world, and of sin and the devil. This means that
each person must recognize the responsibility to &quot;be transformed by the
renewing of [his] mind. . . .&quot; (Rom 12:2</span>).
