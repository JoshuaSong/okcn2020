<b>&quot;I
Indeed . . . But He&quot;

</b><span>(Mat 3:11)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Have
I ever come to the point in my life where I can say, &quot;I indeed . . . but
He . . .&quot;? Until that moment comes, I will never know what the baptism of
the Holy Spirit means. <i>I indeed</i> am at the end, and I cannot do anything
more --- <i>but He</i> begins right there --- He does the things that no one
else can ever do. Am I prepared for His coming? Jesus cannot come and do His
work in me as long as there is anything blocking the way, whether it is
something good or bad. When He comes to me, am I prepared for Him to drag every
wrong thing I have ever done into the light? That is exactly where He comes.
Wherever I know I am unclean is where He will put His feet and stand, and
wherever I think I am clean is where He will remove His feet and walk away.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Repentance
does not cause a sense of sin --- it causes a sense of inexpressible
unworthiness. When I repent, I realize that I am absolutely helpless, and I
know that through and through I am not worthy even to carry His sandals. Have I
repented like that, or do I have a lingering thought of possibly trying to
defend my actions? The reason God cannot come into my life is that I am not at
the point of complete repentance.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;He
will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.&quot; John is not speaking here
of the baptism of the Holy Spirit as an experience, but as a work performed by
Jesus Christ. <i>&quot;He</i> will baptize you . . . .&quot; The only
experience that those who are baptized with the Holy Spirit are ever conscious
of is the experience of sensing their absolute unworthiness.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/><i>&quot;I
indeed&quot;</i>
was this in the past, <i>&quot;but He&quot;</i> came and something miraculous
happened. Get to the end of yourself where you can do nothing, but where He
does everything.
