<b>His
Birth and Our New Birth

</b><span>(Mat 1:23)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/><b>His
Birth in History.</b>
&quot;. . . that Holy One who is to be born will be called the Son of God (<span
>Luk 1:35</span>). Jesus Christ was born <i>into</i>
this world, not <i>from</i> it. He did not emerge out of history; He came into
history from the outside. Jesus Christ is not the best human being the human
race can boast of --- He is a Being for whom the human race can take no credit
at all. He is not man becoming God, but God Incarnate --- God coming into human
flesh from outside it. His life is the highest and the holiest entering through
the most humble of doors. Our Lord''s birth was an advent --- the appearance of
God in human form.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/><b>His
Birth in Me.</b>
&quot;My little children, for whom I labor in birth again until Christ is
formed in you . . .&quot; (Gal 4:19</span>).
Just as our Lord came into human history from outside it, He must also come
into me from outside. Have I allowed my personal human life to become a
&quot;Bethlehem&quot; for the Son of God? I cannot enter the realm of the
kingdom of God unless I am born again from above by a birth totally unlike
physical birth. &quot;You must be born again&quot; (Joh 3:7</span>).
This is not a command, but a fact based on the authority of God. The evidence
of the new birth is that I yield myself so completely to God that &quot;Christ
is formed&quot; in me. And once &quot;Christ is formed&quot; in me, His nature
immediately begins to work through me.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/><b>God
Evident in the Flesh.</b>
This is what is made so profoundly possible for you and for me through the
redemption of man by Jesus Christ.
