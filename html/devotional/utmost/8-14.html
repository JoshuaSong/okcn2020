<b>&quot;The
Discipline of the Lord&quot;

</b><span>(Heb 12:5)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>It
is very easy to grieve the Spirit of God; we do it by despising the discipline
of the Lord, or by becoming discouraged when He rebukes us. If our experience
of being set apart from sin and being made holy through the process of
sanctification is still very shallow, we tend to mistake the reality of God for
something else. And when the Spirit of God gives us a sense of warning or
restraint, we are apt to say mistakenly, &quot;Oh, that must be from the
devil.&quot;

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;Do
not quench the Spirit&quot; (1Th 5:19</span>),
and do not despise Him when He says to you, in effect, &quot;Don''t be blind on
this point anymore --- you are not as far along spiritually as you thought you
were. Until now I have not been able to reveal this to you, but I''m revealing
it to you right now.&quot; When the Lord disciplines you like that, let Him
have His way with you. Allow Him to put you into a right-standing relationship
before God.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;.
. . nor be discouraged when you are rebuked by Him.&quot; We begin to pout,
become irritated with God, and then say, &quot;Oh well, I can''t help it. I
prayed and things didn''t turn out right anyway. So I''m simply going to give
up on everything.&quot; Just think what would happen if we acted like this in
any other area of our lives!

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Am
I fully prepared to allow God to grip me by His power and do a work in me that
is truly worthy of Himself? Sanctification is not my idea of what I want God to
do for me --- sanctification is God''s idea of what He wants to do for me. But
He has to get me into the state of mind and spirit where I will allow Him to
sanctify me completely, whatever the cost (1Th 5:23-24</span>).
