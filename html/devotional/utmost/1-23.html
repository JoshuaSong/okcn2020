<b>God''s
Overpowering Purpose

</b><span>(Act 26:16)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>&nbsp;The
vision Paul had on the road to Damascus was not a passing emotional experience,
but a vision that had very clear and emphatic directions for him. And Paul
stated, &quot;I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision&quot; (<span
>Act 26:19</span>). Our Lord said to Paul, in effect,
&quot;Your whole life is to be overpowered or subdued by Me; you are to have no
end, no aim, and no purpose but Mine.&quot; And the Lord also says to us,
&quot;You did not choose Me, but <i>I chose you</i> and appointed you that you
should go . . .&quot; (Joh 15:16</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>When
we are born again, if we are spiritual at all, we have visions of what Jesus
wants us to be. It is important that I learn not to be &quot;disobedient to the
heavenly vision&quot; --- not to doubt that it can be attained. It is not
enough to give mental assent to the fact that God has redeemed the world, nor
even to know that the Holy Spirit can make all that Jesus did a reality in my
life. I must have the foundation of a personal relationship with Him. Paul was
not given a message or a doctrine to proclaim. He was brought into a vivid,
personal, overpowering relationship with Jesus Christ. (<span
>Act 26:16</span>) is tremendously compelling &quot;. .
. to make you a minister and a witness . . . .&quot; There would be nothing
there without a personal relationship. Paul was devoted to a Person, not to a
cause. He was absolutely Jesus Christ''s. He saw nothing else and he lived for
nothing else. &quot;For I determined not to know anything among you except
Jesus Christ and Him crucified&quot; (1Co 2:2</span>).
