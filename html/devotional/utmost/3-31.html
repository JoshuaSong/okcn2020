<b>Heedfulness
or Hypocrisy in Ourselves?

</b><span>(1Jo 5:16)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>If
we are not heedful and pay no attention to the way the Spirit of God works in
us, we will become spiritual hypocrites. We see where other people are failing,
and then we take our discernment and turn it into comments of ridicule and
criticism, instead of turning it into intercession on their behalf. God reveals
this truth about others to us not through the sharpness of our minds but
through the direct penetration of His Spirit. If we are not attentive, we will
be completely unaware of the source of the discernment God has given us, becoming
critical of others and forgetting that God says, &quot;. . . he will ask, and
He will give him life for those who commit sin not leading to death.&quot; Be
careful that you don''t become a hypocrite by spending all your time trying to
get others right with God before you worship Him yourself.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>One
of the most subtle and illusive burdens God ever places on us as saints is this
burden of discernment concerning others. He gives us discernment so that we may
accept the responsibility for those souls before Him and form the mind of
Christ about them (Phi 2:5</span>). We should
intercede in accordance with what God says He will give us, namely, &quot;life
for those who commit sin not leading to death.&quot; It is not that we are able
to bring God into contact with our minds, but that we awaken ourselves to the
point where God is able to convey His mind to us regarding the people for whom
we intercede.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Can
Jesus Christ see the agony of His soul in us? He can''t unless we are so
closely identified with Him that we have His view concerning the people for
whom we pray. May we learn to intercede so wholeheartedly that Jesus Christ
will be completely and overwhelmingly satisfied with us as intercessors.
