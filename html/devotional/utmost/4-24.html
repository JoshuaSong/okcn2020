<b>The
Warning Against Desiring Spiritual Success

</b><span>(Luk 10:20)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Worldliness
is not the trap that most endangers us as Christian workers; nor is it sin. The
trap we fall into is extravagantly desiring spiritual success; that is, success
measured by, and patterned after, the form set by this religious age in which
we now live. Never seek after anything other than the approval of God, and
always be willing to go &quot;outside the camp, bearing His reproach&quot; (<span
>Heb 13:13</span>). In Luke 10:20 (<span
>Luk 10:20</span>), Jesus told the disciples not to
rejoice in successful service, and yet this seems to be the one thing in which
most of us do rejoice. We have a commercialized view --- we count how many
souls have been saved and sanctified, we thank God, and then we think
everything is all right. Yet our work only begins where God''s grace has laid
the foundation. Our work is not to save souls, but to disciple them. Salvation
and sanctification are the work of God''s sovereign grace, and our work as His
disciples is to disciple others'' lives until they are totally yielded to God.
One life totally devoted to God is of more value to Him than one hundred lives
which have been simply awakened by His Spirit. As workers for God, we must
reproduce our own kind spiritually, and those lives will be God''s testimony to
us as His workers. God brings us up to a standard of life through His grace,
and we are responsible for reproducing that same standard in others.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Unless
the worker lives a life that &quot;is hidden with Christ in God&quot; (<span
>Col 3:3</span>), he is apt to become an irritating
dictator to others, instead of an active, living disciple. Many of us are
dictators, dictating our desires to individuals and to groups. But Jesus never
dictates to us in that way. Whenever our Lord talked about discipleship, He
always prefaced His words with an &quot;if,&quot; never with the forceful or dogmatic
statement --- &quot;You must.&quot; Discipleship carries with it an option.
