<b>Helpful
or Heartless Toward Others?

</b><span>(Rom 8:34, Rom 8:27)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Do
we need any more arguments than these to become intercessors --- that Christ
&quot;always lives to make intercession&quot; (Heb 7:25</span>),
and that the Holy Spirit &quot;makes intercession for the saints&quot;? Are we
living in such a relationship with others that we do the work of intercession
as a result of being the children of God who are taught by His Spirit? We
should take a look at our current circumstances. Do crises which affect us or
others in our home, business, country, or elsewhere, seem to be crushing in on
us? Are we being pushed out of the presence of God and left with no time for
worship? If so, we must put a stop to such distractions and get into such a
living relationship with God that our relationship with others is maintained
through the work of intercession, where God works His miracles.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Beware
of getting ahead of God by your very desire to do His will. We run ahead of Him
in a thousand and one activities, becoming so burdened with people and problems
that we don''t worship God, and we fail to intercede. If a burden and its
resulting pressure come upon us while we are not in an attitude of worship, it
will only produce a hardness toward God and despair in our own souls. God
continually introduces us to people in whom we have no interest, and unless we
are worshiping God the natural tendency is to be heartless toward them. We give
them a quick verse of Scripture, like jabbing them with a spear, or leave them
with a hurried, uncaring word of counsel before we go. A heartless Christian
must be a terrible grief to our Lord.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Are
our lives in the proper place so that we may participate in the intercession of
our Lord and the Holy Spirit?
