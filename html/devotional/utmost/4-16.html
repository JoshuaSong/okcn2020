<b>Can
You Come Down From the Mountain?

</b><span>(Joh 12:36)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>We
all have moments when we feel better than ever before, and we say, &quot;I feel
fit for anything; if only I could always be like this!&quot; We are not meant to
be. Those moments are moments of insight which we have to live up to even when
we do not feel like it. Many of us are no good for the everyday world when we
are not on the mountaintop. Yet we must bring our everyday life up to the
standard revealed to us on the mountaintop when we were there.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Never
allow a feeling that was awakened in you on the mountaintop to evaporate.
Don''t place yourself on the shelf by thinking, &quot;How great to be in such a
wonderful state of mind!&quot; Act immediately --- do something, even if your
only reason to act is that you would rather not. If, during a prayer meeting,
God shows you something to do, don''t say, &quot;I''ll do it&quot; --- just <i>do
it!</i> Pick yourself up by the back of the neck and shake off your fleshly
laziness. Laziness can always be seen in our cravings for a mountaintop
experience; all we talk about is our planning for our time on the mountain. We
must learn to live in the ordinary &quot;gray&quot; day according to what we
saw on the mountain.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Don''t
give up because you have been blocked and confused once --- go after it again.
Burn your bridges behind you, and stand committed to God by an act of your own
will. Never change your decisions, but be sure to make your decisions in the
light of what you saw and learned on the mountain.
