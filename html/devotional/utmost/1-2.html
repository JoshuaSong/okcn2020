<b>Clouds
and Darkness

</b><span>(Psa 97:2)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>&nbsp;A
person who has not been born again by the Spirit of God will tell you that the
teachings of Jesus are simple. But when he is baptized by the Holy Spirit, he
finds that &quot;clouds and darkness surround Him . . . .&quot; When we come
into close contact with the teachings of Jesus Christ we have our first
realization of this. The only possible way to have full understanding of the
teachings of Jesus is through the light of the Spirit of God shining inside us.
If we have never had the experience of taking our casual, religious shoes off
our casual, religious feet --- getting rid of all the excessive informality
with which we approach God --- it is questionable whether we have ever stood in
His presence. The people who are flippant and disrespectful in their approach to
God are those who have never been introduced to Jesus Christ. Only after the
amazing delight and liberty of realizing what Jesus Christ <i>does,</i> comes
the impenetrable &quot;darkness&quot; of realizing who He <i>is.</i>

<br/>Jesus
said, &quot;The words that I speak to you are spirit, and they are life&quot; (<span
>Joh 6:63</span>). Once, the Bible was just so many
words to us --- &quot;clouds and darkness&quot; --- then, suddenly, the words
become spirit and life because Jesus re-speaks them to us when our
circumstances make the words new. That is the way God speaks to us; not by
visions and dreams, but by words. When a man gets to God, it is by the most
simple way --- words.
