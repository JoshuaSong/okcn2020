<b>Is
This True of Me?

</b><span>(Act 20:24)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>It
is easier to serve or work for God without a vision and without a call, because
then you are not bothered by what He requires. Common sense, covered with a
layer of Christian emotion, becomes your guide. You may be more prosperous and
successful from the world''s perspective, and will have more leisure time, if
you never acknowledge the call of God. But once you receive a commission from
Jesus Christ, the memory of what God asks of you will always be there to prod
you on to do His will. You will no longer be able to work for Him on the basis
of common sense.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>What
do I count in my life as &quot;dear to myself&quot;? If I have not been seized
by Jesus Christ and have not surrendered myself to Him, I will consider the
time I decide to give God and my own ideas of service as dear. I will also
consider my own life as &quot;dear to myself.&quot; But Paul said he considered
his life dear so that he might fulfill the ministry he had received, and he
refused to use his energy on anything else. This verse shows an almost noble
annoyance by Paul at being asked to consider himself. He was absolutely
indifferent to any consideration other than that of fulfilling the ministry he
had received. Our ordinary and reasonable service to God may actually compete
against our total surrender to Him. Our reasonable work is based on the
following argument which we say to ourselves, &quot;Remember how useful you are
here, and think how much value you would be in that particular type of
work.&quot; That attitude chooses our own judgment, instead of Jesus Christ, to
be our guide as to where we should go and where we could be used the most.
Never consider whether or not you are of use --- but always consider that
&quot;you are not your own&quot; (1Co 6:19</span>).
You are His.
