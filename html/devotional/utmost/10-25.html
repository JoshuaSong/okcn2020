<b>Submitting
to God''s Purpose

</b><span>(1Co 9:22)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>A
Christian worker has to learn how to be God''s man or woman of great worth and
excellence in the midst of a multitude of meager and worthless things. Never
protest by saying, &quot;If only I were somewhere else!&quot; All of God''s people
are ordinary people who have been made extraordinary by the purpose He has
given them. Unless we have the right purpose intellectually in our minds and
lovingly in our hearts, we will very quickly be diverted from being useful to
God. We are not workers for God by choice. Many people deliberately choose to
be workers, but they have no purpose of God''s almighty grace or His mighty
Word in them. Paul''s whole heart, mind, and soul were consumed with the great
purpose of what Jesus Christ came to do, and he never lost sight of that one
thing. We must continually confront ourselves with one central fact ---&quot;.
. . Jesus Christ and Him crucified&quot; (1Co 2:2</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;I
chose you . . .&quot; (Joh 15:16</span>). Keep
these words as a wonderful reminder in your theology. It is not that you have
gotten God, but that He has gotten you. God is at work bending, breaking,
molding, and doing exactly as He chooses. And why is He doing it? He is doing
it for only one purpose --- that He may be able to say, &quot;This is My man,
and this is My woman.&quot; We have to be in God''s hand so that He can place
others on the Rock, Jesus Christ, just as He has placed us.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Never
choose to be a worker, but once God has placed His call upon you, woe be to you
if you &quot;turn aside . . . to the right or the left . . .&quot; (<span
>Deu 28:14</span>). He will do with you what He never
did before His call came to you, and He will do with you what He is not doing
with other people. Let Him have His way.
