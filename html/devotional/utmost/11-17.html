<b>The
Eternal Goal

</b><span>(Gen 22:16-17)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Abraham,
at this point, has reached the place where he is in touch with the very nature
of God. He now understands the reality of God.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>My
goal is God Himself . . . 

<br/>At
any cost, dear Lord, by any road. 

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;At
any cost . . . by any road&quot; means submitting to God''s way of bringing us
to the goal.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>There
is no possibility of questioning God when He speaks, if He speaks to His own
nature in me. Prompt obedience is the only result. When Jesus says,
&quot;Come,&quot; I simply come; when He says, &quot;Let go,&quot; I let go;
when He says, &quot;Trust God in this matter,&quot; I trust. This work of
obedience is the evidence that the nature of God is in me.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>God''s
revelation of Himself to me is influenced by my character, not by God''s
character.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>''Tis
because I am ordinary, 

<br/>Thy
ways so often look ordinary to me. 

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>It
is through the discipline of obedience that I get to the place where Abraham
was and I see who God is. God will never be real to me until I come face to
face with Him in Jesus Christ. Then I will know and can boldly proclaim,
&quot;In all the world, my God, there is none but Thee, there is none but
Thee.&quot;

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
promises of God are of no value to us until, through obedience, we come to
understand the nature of God. We may read some things in the Bible every day
for a year and they may mean nothing to us. Then, because we have been obedient
to God in some small detail, we suddenly see what God means and His nature is
instantly opened up to us. &quot;All the promises of God in Him are Yes, and in
Him Amen . . .&quot; (2Co 1:20</span>). Our
&quot;Yes&quot; must be born of obedience; when by obedience we ratify a
promise of God by saying, &quot;Amen,&quot; or, &quot;So be it.&quot; That
promise becomes ours.
