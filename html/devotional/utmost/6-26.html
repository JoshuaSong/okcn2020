<b>Drawing
on the Grace of God --- Now

</b><span>(2Co 6:1)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>The
grace you had yesterday will not be sufficient for today. Grace is the
overflowing favor of God, and you can always count on it being available to
draw upon as needed. &quot;. . . in much patience, in tribulations, in needs,
in distresses&quot; --- that is where our patience is tested (<span
>2Co 6:4</span>). Are you failing to rely on the grace
of God there? Are you saying to yourself, &quot;Oh well, I won''t count this
time&quot;? It is not a question of praying and asking God to help you --- it
is taking the grace of God <i>now.</i> We tend to make prayer the preparation
for our service, yet it is never that in the Bible. Prayer is the practice of
drawing on the grace of God. Don''t say, &quot;I will endure this until I can
get away and pray.&quot; Pray <i>now</i>--- draw on the grace of God in your
moment of need. Prayer is the most normal and useful thing; it is not simply a
reflex action of your devotion to God. We are very slow to learn to draw on
God''s grace through prayer.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;.
. . in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors . . .&quot; (<span
>2Co 6:5</span>) --- in all these things, display in
your life a drawing on the grace of God, which will show evidence to yourself
and to others that you are a miracle of His. Draw on His grace now, not later.
The primary word in the spiritual vocabulary is <i>now.</i> Let circumstances
take you where they will, but keep drawing on the grace of God in whatever
condition you may find yourself. One of the greatest proofs that you are
drawing on the grace of God is that you can be totally humiliated before others
without displaying even the slightest trace of anything but His grace.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;.
. . having nothing . . . .&quot; Never hold anything in reserve. Pour yourself
out, giving the best that you have, and always be poor. Never be diplomatic and
careful with the treasure God gives you. &quot;. . . and yet possessing all
things&quot; --- this is poverty triumphant (2Co 6:10</span>).
