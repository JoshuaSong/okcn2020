<b>The
Compelling Majesty of His Power

</b><span>(2Co 5:14)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Paul
said that he was overpowered, subdued, and held as in a vise by &quot;the love
of Christ.&quot; Very few of us really know what it means to be held in the
grip of the love of God. We tend so often to be controlled simply by our own
experience. The one thing that gripped and held Paul, to the exclusion of
everything else, was the love of God. &quot;The love of Christ compels us . . .
.&quot; When you hear that coming from the life of a man or woman it is
unmistakable. You will know that the Spirit of God is completely unhindered in
that person''s life.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>When
we are born again by the Spirit of God, our testimony is based solely on what
God has done for us, and rightly so. But that will change and be removed
forever once you &quot;receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you . .
.&quot; (Act 1:8</span>). Only then will you
begin to realize what Jesus meant when He went on to say, &quot;. . . you shall
be <i>witnesses</i> to Me . . . .&quot; Not witnesses to what Jesus can do ---
that is basic and understood --- but &quot;witnesses to Me . . . .&quot; We
will accept everything that happens as if it were happening to Him, whether we
receive praise or blame, persecution or reward. No one is able to take this
stand for Jesus Christ who is not totally compelled by the majesty of His
power. It is the only thing that matters, and yet it is strange that it''s the
last thing we as Christian workers realize. Paul said that he was gripped by
the love of God and that is why he acted as he did. People could perceive him
as mad or sane --- he did not care. There was only one thing he lived for ---
to persuade people of the coming judgment of God and to tell them of &quot;the
love of Christ.&quot; This total surrender to &quot;the love of Christ&quot; is
the only thing that will bear fruit in your life. And it will always leave the
mark of God''s holiness and His power, never drawing attention to your personal
holiness.
