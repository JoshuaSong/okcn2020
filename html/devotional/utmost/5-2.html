<b>The
Patience To Wait for the Vision

</b><span>(Hab 2:3)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Patience
is not the same as indifference; patience conveys the idea of someone who is
tremendously strong and able to withstand all assaults. Having the vision of
God is the source of patience because it gives us God''s true and proper
inspiration. Moses endured, not because of his devotion to his principles of
what was right, nor because of his sense of duty to God, but because he had a
vision of God. &quot;. . . he endured as seeing Him who is invisible&quot; <span
>Heb 11:27</span>. A person who has the vision of God is
not devoted to a cause or to any particular issuehe is devoted to God Himself.
You always know when the vision is of God because of the inspiration that comes
with it. Things come to you with greatness and add vitality to your life
because everything is energized by God. He may give you a time spiritually,
with no word from Himself at all, just as His Son experienced during His time
of temptation in the wilderness. When God does that, simply endure, and the
power to endure will be there because you see God.

<br/>&quot;Though
it tarries, wait for it . . . .&quot; The proof that we have the vision is that
we are reaching out for more than we have already grasped. It is a bad thing to
be satisfied spiritually. The psalmist said, &quot;What shall I render to the
Lord . . . ? I will <i>take up</i> the cup of salvation . . .&quot; <span
>Psa 116:12-13</span>. We are apt to look for
satisfaction within ourselves and say, &quot;Now I''ve got it! Now I am
completely sanctified. Now I can endure.&quot; Instantly we are on the road to
ruin. Our reach must exceed our grasp. Paul said, &quot;Not that I have already
attained, or am already perfected; but I press on . . .&quot; <span
>Phi 3:12</span>. If we have only what we have
experienced, we have nothing. But if we have the inspiration of the vision of
God, we have more than we can experience. Beware of the danger of spiritual
relaxation.
