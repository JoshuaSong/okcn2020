<br/><b>Co-Resurrection.</b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Trebuchet MS","sans-serif"'> The proof that I
have experienced crucifixion with Jesus is that I have a definite likeness to
Him. The Spirit of Jesus entering me rearranges my personal life before God.
The resurrection of Jesus has given Him the authority to give the life of God
to me, and the experiences of my life must now be built on the foundation of
His life. I can have the resurrection life of Jesus here and now, and it will
exhibit itself through holiness.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
idea all through the apostle Paul''s writings is that after the decision to be
identified with Jesus in His death has been made, the resurrection life of
Jesus penetrates every bit of my human nature. It takes the omnipotence of God
--- His complete and effective divinity --- to live the life of the Son of God
in human flesh. The Holy Spirit cannot be accepted as a guest in merely one
room of the house --- He invades all of it. And once I decide that my &quot;old
man&quot; (that is, my heredity of sin) should be identified with the death of
Jesus, the Holy Spirit invades me. He takes charge of everything. My part is to
walk in the light and to obey all that He reveals to me. Once I have made that
important decision about sin, it is easy to &quot;reckon&quot; that I am actually
&quot;dead indeed to sin,&quot; because I find the life of Jesus in me all the
time (Rom 6:11</span>). Just as there is only
one kind of humanity, there is only one kind of holiness --- the holiness of
Jesus. And it is His holiness that has been given to me. God puts the holiness
of His Son into me, and I belong to a new spiritual order.
