<b>The
Forgiveness of God

</b><span>(Eph 1:7)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Beware
of the pleasant view of the fatherhood of God: God is so kind and loving that
of course He will forgive us. That thought, based solely on emotion, cannot be
found anywhere in the New Testament. The only basis on which God can forgive us
is the tremendous tragedy of the Cross of Christ. To base our forgiveness on
any other ground is unconscious blasphemy. The only ground on which God can
forgive our sin and reinstate us to His favor is through the Cross of Christ.
There is no other way! Forgiveness, which is so easy for us to accept, cost the
agony at Calvary. We should never take the forgiveness of sin, the gift of the
Holy Spirit, and our sanctification in simple faith, and then forget the
enormous cost to God that made all of this ours.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Forgiveness
is the divine miracle of grace. The cost to God was the Cross of Christ. To
forgive sin, while remaining a holy God, this price had to be paid. Never
accept a view of the fatherhood of God if it blots out the atonement. The
revealed truth of God is that without the atonement He cannot forgive --- He
would contradict His nature if He did. The only way we can be forgiven is by
being brought back to God through the atonement of the Cross. God''s
forgiveness is possible only in the supernatural realm.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Compared
with the miracle of the forgiveness of sin, the experience of sanctification is
small. Sanctification is simply the wonderful expression or evidence of the
forgiveness of sins in a human life. But the thing that awakens the deepest
fountain of gratitude in a human being is that God has forgiven his sin. Paul
never got away from this. Once you realize all that it cost God to forgive you,
you will be held as in a vise, constrained by the love of God.
