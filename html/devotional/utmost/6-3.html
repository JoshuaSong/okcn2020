<b>&quot;The
Secret of the Lord&quot;

</b><span>(Psa 25:14)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>What
is the sign of a friend? Is it that he tells you his secret sorrows? No, it is
that he tells you his secret joys. Many people will confide their secret
sorrows to you, but the final mark of intimacy is when they share their secret
joys with you. Have we ever let God tell us any of His joys? Or are we
continually telling God our secrets, leaving Him no time to talk to us? At the
beginning of our Christian life we are full of requests to God. But then we
find that God wants to get us into an intimate relationship with Himselfto get
us in touch with His purposes. Are we so intimately united to Jesus Christ''s
idea of prayer --- &quot;Your will be done&quot; (Mat 6:10</span>)
--- that we catch the secrets of God? What makes God so dear to us is not so
much His big blessings to us, but the tiny things, because they show His
amazing intimacy with us --- He knows every detail of each of our individual
lives.

<br/>&quot;Him
shall He teach in the way He chooses&quot; (Psa 25:12</span>).
At first, we want the awareness of being guided by God. But then as we grow
spiritually, we live so fully aware of God that we do not even need to ask what
His will is, because the thought of choosing another way will never occur to
us. If we are saved and sanctified, God guides us by our everyday choices. And
if we are about to choose what He does not want, He will give us a sense of
doubt or restraint, which we must heed. Whenever there is doubt, stop at once.
Never try to reason it out, saying, &quot;I wonder why I shouldn''t do this?&quot;
God instructs us in what we choose; that is, He actually guides our common
sense. And when we yield to His teachings and guidance, we no longer hinder His
Spirit by continually asking, &quot;Now, Lord, what is Your will?&quot;
