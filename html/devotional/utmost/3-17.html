<b>The
Servant''s Primary Goal

</b><span>(2Co 5:9)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>We
make it our aim. . . .&quot; It requires a conscious decision and effort to
keep our primary goal constantly in front of us. It means holding ourselves to
the highest priority year in and year out; not making our first priority to win
souls, or to establish churches, or to have revivals, but seeking only &quot;to
be well pleasing to Him.&quot; It is not a lack of spiritual experience that
leads to failure, but a lack of working to keep our eyes focused and on the
right goal. At least once a week examine yourself before God to see if your
life is measuring up to the standard He has for you. Paul was like a musician
who gives no thought to audience approval, if he can only catch a look of
approval from his Conductor.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Any
goal we have that diverts us even to the slightest degree from the central goal
of being &quot;approved to God&quot; (2Ti 2:15</span>)
may result in our rejection from further service for Him. When you discern
where the goal leads, you will understand why it is so necessary to keep
&quot;looking unto Jesus&quot; (Heb 12:2</span>).
Paul spoke of the importance of controlling his own body so that it would not
take him in the wrong direction. He said, &quot;I discipline my body and bring
it into subjection, lest . . . I myself should become disqualified&quot; (<span
>1Co 9:27</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>I
must learn to relate everything to the primary goal, maintaining it without
interruption. My worth to God publicly is measured by what I really am in my
private life. Is my primary goal in life to please Him and to be acceptable to
Him, or is it something less, no matter how lofty it may sound?
