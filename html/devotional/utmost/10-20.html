<b>Is
God''s Will My Will?

</b><span>(1Th 4:3)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Sanctification
is not a question of whether God is willing to sanctify me --- is it <i>my</i>
will? Am I willing to let God do in me everything that has been made possible
through the atonement of the Cross of Christ? Am I willing to let Jesus become
sanctification to me, and to let His life be exhibited in my human flesh? (<span
>1Co 1:30</span>). Beware of saying, &quot;Oh, I am
longing to be sanctified.&quot; No, you are not. Recognize your need, but stop
longing and make it a matter of action. Receive Jesus Christ to become
sanctification for you by absolute, unquestioning faith, and the great miracle
of the atonement of Jesus will become real in you.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>All
that Jesus made possible becomes mine through the free and loving gift of God
on the basis of what Christ accomplished on the cross. And my attitude as a
saved and sanctified soul is that of profound, humble holiness (there is no
such thing as proud holiness). It is a holiness based on agonizing repentance,
a sense of inexpressible shame and degradation, and also on the amazing
realization that the love of God demonstrated itself to me while I cared
nothing about Him (Rom 5:8</span>). He
completed everything for my salvation and sanctification. No wonder Paul said
that nothing &quot;shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is
in Christ Jesus our Lord&quot; (Rom 8:39</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Sanctification
makes me one with Jesus Christ, and in Him one with God, and it is accomplished
only through the magnificent atonement of Christ. Never confuse the effect with
the cause. The effect in me is obedience, service, and prayer, and is the outcome
of inexpressible thanks and adoration for the miraculous sanctification that
has been brought about in me because of the atonement through the Cross of
Christ.
