<b>&quot;It
is Finished!&quot;

</b><span>(Joh 17:4)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>The
death of Jesus Christ is the fulfillment in history of the very mind and intent
of God. There is no place for seeing Jesus Christ as a martyr. His death was
not something that happened <i>to</i> Him --- something that might have been
prevented. His death was the very reason He came.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Never
build your case for forgiveness on the idea that God is our Father and He will
forgive us because He loves us. That contradicts the revealed truth of God in
Jesus Christ. It makes the Cross unnecessary, and the redemption &quot;much ado
about nothing.&quot; God forgives sin only because of the death of Christ. God
could forgive people in no other way than by the death of His Son, and Jesus is
exalted as Savior because of His death. &quot;We see Jesus . . . <i>for the
suffering of death</i> crowned with glory and honor . . .&quot; (<span
>Heb 2:9</span>). The greatest note of triumph ever
sounded in the ears of a startled universe was that sounded on the Cross of
Christ --- <i>&quot;It is finished!&quot;</i> (Joh 19:30</span>).
That is the final word in the redemption of humankind.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Anything
that lessens or completely obliterates the holiness of God, through a false
view of His love, contradicts the truth of God as revealed by Jesus Christ.
Never allow yourself to believe that Jesus Christ stands with us, and against
God, out of pity and compassion, or that He became a curse for us out of
sympathy for us. Jesus Christ became a curse for us by divine decree. Our part
in realizing the tremendous meaning of His curse is the conviction of sin.
Conviction is given to us as a gift of shame and repentance; it is the great mercy
of God. Jesus Christ hates the sin in people, and Calvary is the measure of His
hatred.
