<b>Readiness

</b><span>(Exo 3:4)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>When
God speaks, many of us are like people in a fog, and we give no answer. Moses''
reply to God revealed that he knew where he was and that he was ready.
Readiness means having a right relationship to God and having the knowledge of
where we are. We are so busy telling God where we would like to go. Yet the man
or woman who is ready for God and His work is the one who receives the prize
when the summons comes. We wait with the idea that some great opportunity or
something sensational will be coming our way, and when it does come we are
quick to cry out, &quot;Here I am.&quot; Whenever we sense that Jesus Christ is
rising up to take authority over some great task, we are there, but we are not
ready for some obscure duty.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Readiness
for God means that we are prepared to do the smallest thing or the largest
thing --- it makes no difference. It means we have no choice in what we want to
do, but that whatever God''s plans may be, we are there and ready. Whenever any
duty presents itself, we hear God''s voice as our Lord heard His Father''s
voice, and we are ready for it with the total readiness of our love for Him.
Jesus Christ expects to do with us just as His Father did with Him. He can put
us wherever He wants, in pleasant duties or in menial ones, because our union
with Him is the same as His union with the Father. &quot;. . . that they may be
one just as We are one . . .&quot; (Joh 17:22</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Be
ready for the sudden surprise visits of God. A ready person never needs to <i>get</i>
ready --- he is ready. Think of the time we waste trying to get ready once God
has called! The burning bush is a symbol of everything that surrounds the
person who is ready, and it is on fire with the presence of God Himself.
