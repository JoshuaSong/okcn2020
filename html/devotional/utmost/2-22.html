<b>The
Determination to Serve

</b><span>(Mat 20:28)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Jesus
also said, &quot;Yet I am among you as the One who serves&quot; (<span
>Luk 22:27</span>). Paul''s idea of service was the same
as our Lord''s --- &quot;. . . ourselves your bondservants for Jesus''
sake&quot; (2Co 4:5</span>). We somehow have
the idea that a person called to the ministry is called to be different and
above other people. But according to Jesus Christ, he is called to be a
&quot;doormat&quot; for others --- called to be their spiritual leader, but
never their superior. Paul said, &quot;I know how to be abased . . .&quot; (<span
>Phi 4:12</span>). Paul''s idea of service was to pour
his life out to the last drop for others. And whether he received praise or
blame made no difference. As long as there was one human being who did not know
Jesus, Paul felt a debt of service to that person until he did come to know
Him. But the chief motivation behind Paul''s service was not love for others
but love for his Lord. If our devotion is to the cause of humanity, we will be
quickly defeated and broken-hearted, since we will often be confronted with a
great deal of ingratitude from other people. But if we are motivated by our
love for God, no amount of ingratitude will be able to hinder us from serving
one another. 

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Paul''s
understanding of how Christ had dealt with him is the secret behind his
determination to serve others. &quot;I was formerly a blasphemer, a persecutor,
and an insolent man . . .&quot; (1Ti 1:13</span>).
In other words, no matter how badly others may have treated Paul, they could
never have treated him with the same degree of spite and hatred with which he
had treated Jesus Christ. Once we realize that Jesus has served us even to the
depths of our meagerness, our selfishness, and our sin, nothing we encounter
from others will be able to exhaust our determination to serve others for His
sake.
