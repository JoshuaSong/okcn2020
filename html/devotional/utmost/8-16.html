<b>Does
He Know Me . . . ?

</b><span>(Joh 10:3)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/><b>When
I have sadly misunderstood Him?</b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:
"Trebuchet MS","sans-serif"'> (Joh 20:11-18</span>).
It is possible to know all about doctrine and still not know Jesus. A person''s
soul is in grave danger when the knowledge of doctrine surpasses Jesus,
avoiding intimate touch with Him. Why was Mary weeping? Doctrine meant no more
to her than the grass under her feet. In fact, any Pharisee could have made a
fool of Mary doctrinally, but one thing they could never ridicule was the fact
that Jesus had cast seven demons out of her (Luk 8:2</span>);
yet His blessings were nothing to her in comparison with knowing Jesus Himself.
&quot;. . . she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, and did not know
that it was Jesus. . . . Jesus said to her, ''Mary!'' &quot; (<span
>Joh 20:14, Joh 20:16</span>). Once He called Mary by
her name, she immediately knew that she had a personal history with the One who
spoke. &quot;She turned and said to Him, ''Rabboni!'' &quot; (<span
>Joh 20:16</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/><b>When
I have stubbornly doubted?</b>
(Joh 20:24-29</span>). Have I been doubting
something about Jesus --- maybe an experience to which others testify, but
which I have not yet experienced? The other disciples said to Thomas, &quot;We
have seen the Lord&quot; (Joh 20:25</span>).
But Thomas doubted, saying, &quot;Unless I see . . . I will not believe&quot; (<span
>Joh 20:25</span>). Thomas needed the personal touch of
Jesus. When His touches will come we never know, but when they do come they are
indescribably precious. &quot;Thomas . . . said to Him, ''My Lord and my God!''
&quot; (Joh 20:28</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/><b>When
I have selfishly denied Him?</b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:
"Trebuchet MS","sans-serif"'> (Joh 21:15-17</span>).
Peter denied Jesus Christ with oaths and curses (Mat 26:69-75</span>),
and yet after His resurrection Jesus appeared to Peter alone. Jesus restored
Peter in private, and then He restored him publicly before the others. And
Peter said to Him, &quot;Lord . . . You know that I love You&quot; (<span
>Joh 21:17</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Do
I have a personal history with Jesus Christ? The one true sign of discipleship
is intimate oneness with Him --- a knowledge of Jesus that nothing can shake.
