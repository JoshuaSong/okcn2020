<b>Deserter
or Disciple?

</b><span>(Joh 6:66)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>When
God, by His Spirit through His Word, gives you a clear vision of His will, you
must &quot;walk in the light&quot; of that vision (1Jo 1:7</span>).
Even though your mind and soul may be thrilled by it, if you don''t &quot;walk
in the light&quot; of it you will sink to a level of bondage never envisioned
by our Lord. Mentally disobeying the &quot;heavenly vision&quot; (<span
>Act 26:19</span>) will make you a slave to ideas and
views that are completely foreign to Jesus Christ. Don''t look at someone else
and say, &quot;Well, if he can have those views and prosper, why can''t
I?&quot; You have to &quot;walk in the light&quot; of the vision that has been
given to <i>you.</i> Don''t compare yourself with others or judge them --- that
is between God and them. When you find that one of your favorite and strongly
held views clashes with the &quot;heavenly vision,&quot; do not begin to debate
it. If you do, a sense of property and personal right will emerge in you ---
things on which Jesus placed no value. He was against these things as being the
root of everything foreign to Himself --- &quot;. . . for one''s life does not
consist in the abundance of the things he possesses&quot; (<span
>Luk 12:15</span>). If we don''t see and understand
this, it is because we are ignoring the underlying principles of our Lord''s
teaching.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Our
tendency is to lie back and bask in the memory of the wonderful experience we
had when God revealed His will to us. But if a New Testament standard is
revealed to us by the light of God, and we don''t try to measure up, or even
feel inclined to do so, then we begin to backslide. It means your conscience
does not respond to the truth. You can never be the same after the unveiling of
a truth. That moment marks you as one who either continues on with even more
devotion as a disciple of Jesus Christ, or as one who turns to go back as a
deserter.
