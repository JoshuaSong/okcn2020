<b>The
Bewildering Call of God

</b><span>(Luk 18:31, Luk 18:34)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>God
called Jesus Christ to what seemed absolute disaster. And Jesus Christ called
His disciples to see Him put to death, leading every one of them to the place
where their hearts were broken. His life was an absolute failure from every
standpoint except God''s. But what seemed to be failure from man''s standpoint
was a triumph from God''s standpoint, because God''s purpose is never the same
as man''s purpose.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>This
bewildering call of God comes into our lives as well. The call of God can never
be understood absolutely or explained externally; it is a call that can only be
perceived and understood internally by our true inner-nature. The call of God
is like the call of the sea --- no one hears it except the person who has the
nature of the sea in him. What God calls us to cannot be definitely stated,
because His call is simply to be His friend to accomplish His own purposes. Our
real test is in truly believing that God knows what He desires. The things that
happen do not happen by chance --- they happen entirely by the decree of God.
God is sovereignly working out His own purposes.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>If
we are in fellowship and oneness with God and recognize that He is taking us
into His purposes, then we will no longer strive to find out what His purposes
are. As we grow in the Christian life, it becomes simpler to us, because we are
less inclined to say, &quot;I wonder why God allowed this or that?&quot; And we
begin to see that the compelling purpose of God lies behind everything in life,
and that God is divinely shaping us into oneness with that purpose. A Christian
is someone who trusts in the knowledge and the wisdom of God, not in his own
abilities. If we have a purpose of our own, it destroys the simplicity and the
calm, relaxed pace which should be characteristic of the children of God.
