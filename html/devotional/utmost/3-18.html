<b>Will
I Bring Myself Up to This Level?

</b><span>(2Co 7:1)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Therefore,
having these promises. . . .&quot; I claim God''s promises for my life and look
to their fulfillment, and rightly so, but that shows only the human perspective
on them. God''s perspective is that through His promises I will come to
recognize His claim of ownership on me. For example, do I realize that my
&quot;body is the temple of the Holy Spirit,&quot; or am I condoning some habit
in my body which clearly could not withstand the light of God on it? (<span
>1Co 6:19</span>). God formed His Son in me through
sanctification, setting me apart from sin and making me holy in His sight (<span
>Gal 4:19</span>). But I must begin to transform my
natural life into spiritual life by obedience to Him. God instructs us even in
the smallest details of life. And when He brings you conviction of sin, do not
&quot;confer with flesh and blood,&quot; but cleanse yourself from it at once (<span
>Gal 1:16</span>). Keep yourself cleansed in your daily
walk.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>I
must cleanse myself from all filthiness in my flesh and my spirit until both
are in harmony with the nature of God. Is the mind of my spirit in perfect
agreement with the life of the Son of God in me, or am I mentally rebellious
and defiant? Am I allowing the mind of Christ to be formed in me? (<span
>Phi 2:5</span>). Christ never spoke of His right to
Himself, but always maintained an inner vigilance to submit His spirit
continually to His Father. I also have the responsibility to keep my spirit in
agreement with His Spirit. And when I do, Jesus gradually lifts me up to the
level where He lived --- a level of perfect submission to His Father''s
willwhere I pay no attention to anything else. Am I perfecting this kind of
holiness in the fear of God? Is God having His way with me, and are people
beginning to see God in my life more and more?

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Be
serious in your commitment to God and gladly leave everything else alone.
Literally put God first in your life.
