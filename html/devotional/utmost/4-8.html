<b>His
Resurrection Destiny

</b><span>(Luk 24:26)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Our
Lord''s Cross is the gateway into His life. His resurrection means that He has
the power to convey His life to me. When I was born again, I received the very
life of the risen Lord from Jesus Himself.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Christ''s
resurrection destiny --- His foreordained purpose --- was to bring &quot;many
sons to glory&quot; (Heb 2:10</span>). The
fulfilling of His destiny gives Him the right to make us sons and daughters of
God. We never have exactly the same relationship to God that the Son of God
has, but we are brought by the Son into the relation of sonship. When our Lord
rose from the dead, He rose to an absolutely new life --- a life He had never
lived before He was God Incarnate. He rose to a life that had never been
before. And what His resurrection means for us is that we are raised to His
risen life, not to our old life. One day we will have a body like His glorious
body, but we can know here and now the power and effectiveness of His
resurrection and can &quot;walk in newness of life&quot; (<span
>Rom 6:4</span>). Paul''s determined purpose was to
&quot;know Him <i>and the power of His resurrection&quot;</i> (<span
>Phi 3:10</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Jesus
prayed, &quot;. . . as You have given Him authority over all flesh that He
should give eternal life to as many as You have given Him&quot; (<span
>Joh 17:2</span>). The term <i>Holy Spirit</i> is
actually another name for the experience of eternal life working in human
beings here and now. The Holy Spirit is the deity of God who continues to apply
the power of the atonement by the Cross of Christ to our lives. Thank God for
the glorious and majestic truth that His Spirit can work the very nature of
Jesus into us, if we will only obey Him.
