<b>The
Miracle of Belief

</b><span>(1Co 2:4)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Paul
was a scholar and an orator of the highest degree; he was not speaking here out
of a deep sense of humility, but was saying that when he preached the gospel,
he would veil the power of God if he impressed people with the excellency of
his speech. Belief in Jesus is a miracle produced only by the effectiveness of
redemption, not by impressive speech, nor by wooing and persuading, but only by
the sheer unaided power of God. The creative power of redemption comes through
the preaching of the gospel, but never because of the personality of the
preacher.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Real
and effective fasting by a preacher is not fasting from food, but fasting from
eloquence, from impressive diction, and from everything else that might hinder
the gospel of God being presented. The preacher is there as the representative
of God --- &quot;. . . as though God were pleading through us . . .&quot; (<span
>2Co 5:20</span>). He is there to present the gospel of
God. If it is only because of my preaching that people desire to be better,
they will never get close to Jesus Christ. Anything that flatters me in my
preaching of the gospel will result in making me a traitor to Jesus, and I
prevent the creative power of His redemption from doing its work.

<br/><i>&quot;And
I, if I am lifted up . . . , will draw all peoples to Myself&quot;</i><span
