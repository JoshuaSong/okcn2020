<b>Friendship
with God

</b><span>(Gen 18:17)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/><b>The
Delights of His Friendship.</b>
Genesis 18 brings out the delight of true friendship with God, as compared with
simply feeling His presence occasionally in prayer. This friendship means being
so intimately in touch with God that you never even need to ask Him to show you
His will. It is evidence of a level of intimacy which confirms that you are
nearing the final stage of your discipline in the life of faith. When you have
a right-standing relationship with God, you have a life of freedom, liberty,
and delight; you <i>are</i> God''s will. And all of your commonsense decisions
are actually His will for you, unless you sense a feeling of restraint brought
on by a check in your spirit. You are free to make decisions in the light of a
perfect and delightful friendship with God, knowing that if your decisions are
wrong He will lovingly produce that sense of restraint. Once he does, you must
stop immediately.

<br/><b>The
Difficulties of His Friendship.</b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:
"Trebuchet MS","sans-serif"'> Why did Abraham stop praying when he did? He
stopped because he still was lacking the level of intimacy in his relationship
with God, which would enable him boldly to continue on with the Lord in prayer
until his desire was granted. Whenever we stop short of our true desire in
prayer and say, &quot;Well, I don''t know, maybe this is not God''s will,&quot;
then we still have another level to go. It shows that we are not as intimately
acquainted with God as Jesus was, and as Jesus would have us to be ---&quot;. .
. that they may be one just as We are one . . .&quot; (<span
>Joh 17:22</span>). Think of the last thing you prayed
about-were you devoted to your desire or to God? Was your determination to get
some gift of the Spirit for yourself or to get to God? &quot;For your Father
knows the things you have need of before you ask Him&quot; (<span
>Mat 6:8</span>). The reason for asking is so you may
get to know God better. &quot;Delight yourself also in the Lord, and He shall
give you the desires of your heart&quot; (Psa 37:4</span>).
We should keep praying to get a perfect understanding of God Himself.
