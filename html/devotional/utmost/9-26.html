<b>The
&quot;Go&quot; of Reconciliation

</b><span>(Mat 5:23)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>This
verse says, &quot;If you bring your gift to the altar, and there remember that
your brother has something against you . . . .&quot; It is not saying, &quot;If
you search and find something because of your unbalanced sensitivity,&quot;
but, &quot;If you . . . remember . . . .&quot; In other words, if something is
brought to your conscious mind by the Spirit of God --- &quot;First be reconciled
to your brother, and then come and offer your gift&quot; (<span
>Mat 5:24</span>). Never object to the intense
sensitivity of the Spirit of God in you when He is instructing you down to the
smallest detail.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;First
be reconciled to your brother . . . .&quot; Our Lord''s directive is simple ---
&quot;First be reconciled . . . .&quot; He says, in effect, &quot;Go back the
way you came --- the way indicated to you by the conviction given to you at the
altar; have an attitude in your mind and soul toward the person who has
something against you that makes reconciliation as natural as breathing.&quot;
Jesus does not mention the other person --- He says for <i>you</i> to go. It is
not a matter of your rights. The true mark of the saint is that he can waive
his own rights and obey the Lord Jesus.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;.
. . and then come and offer your gift.&quot; The process of reconciliation is
clearly marked. First we have the heroic spirit of self-sacrifice, then the
sudden restraint by the sensitivity of the Holy Spirit, and then we are stopped
at the point of our conviction. This is followed by obedience to the Word of
God, which builds an attitude or state of mind that places no blame on the one
with whom you have been in the wrong. And finally there is the glad, simple,
unhindered offering of your gift to God.
