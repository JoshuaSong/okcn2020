<b>Are
You Going on With Jesus?

</b><span>(Luk 22:28)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>It
is true that Jesus Christ is with us through our temptations, but are we going
on with Him through His temptations? Many of us turn back from going on with
Jesus from the very moment we have an experience of what He can do. Watch when
God changes your circumstances to see whether you are going on with Jesus, or
siding with the world, the flesh, and the devil. We wear His name, but are we
going on with Him? &quot;From that time many of His disciples went back and
walked with Him no more&quot; (Joh 6:66</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
temptations of Jesus continued throughout His earthly life, and they will
continue throughout the life of the Son of God in us. Are we going on with
Jesus in the life we are living right now?

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>We
have the idea that we ought to shield ourselves from some of the things God
brings around us. May it never be! It is God who engineers our circumstances,
and whatever they may be we must see that we face them while continually
abiding with Him in His temptations. They are <i>His</i> temptations, not
temptations to us, but temptations to the life of the Son of God in us. Jesus
Christ''s honor is at stake in our bodily lives. Are we remaining faithful to
the Son of God in everything that attacks His life in us?

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Are
you going on with Jesus? The way goes through Gethsemane, through the city
gate, and on &quot;outside the camp&quot; (Heb 13:13</span>).
The way is lonely and goes on until there is no longer even a trace of a
footprint to follow --- but only the voice saying, <i>&quot;Follow Me&quot;</i>
(Mat 4:19</span>)
