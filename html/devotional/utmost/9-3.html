<b>Pouring
Out the Water of Satisfaction

</b><span>(2Sa 23:16)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>What
has been like &quot;water from the well of Bethlehem&quot; to you recently ---
love, friendship, or maybe some spiritual blessing (2Sa 23:16</span>)?
Have you taken whatever it may be, even at the risk of damaging your own soul,
simply to satisfy yourself? If you have, then you cannot pour it out &quot;to
the Lord.&quot; You can never set apart for God something that you desire for
yourself to achieve your own satisfaction. If you try to satisfy yourself with
a blessing from God, it will corrupt you. You must sacrifice it, pouring it out
to God --- something that your common sense says is an absurd waste.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>How
can I pour out &quot;to the Lord&quot; natural love and spiritual blessings?
There is only one way --- I must make a determination in my mind to do so.
There are certain things other people do that could never be received by
someone who does not know God, because it is humanly impossible to repay them.
As soon as I realize that something is too wonderful for me, that I am not
worthy to receive it, and that it is not meant for a human being at all, I must
pour it out &quot;to the Lord.&quot; Then these very things that have come to
me will be poured out as &quot;rivers of living water&quot; all around me (<span
>Joh 7:38</span>). And until I pour these things out to
God, they actually endanger those I love, as well as myself, because they will
be turned into lust. Yes, we can be lustful in things that are not sordid and
vile. Even love must be transformed by being poured out &quot;to the
Lord.&quot;

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>If
you have become bitter and sour, it is because when God gave you a blessing you
hoarded it. Yet if you had poured it out to Him, you would have been the
sweetest person on earth. If you are always keeping blessings to yourself and
never learning to pour out anything &quot;to the Lord,&quot; other people will
never have their vision of God expanded through you.
