<b>The
Authority of Truth

</b><span>(Jam 4:8)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>It
is essential that you give people the opportunity to act on the truth of God.
The responsibility must be left with the individual --- you cannot act for him.
It must be his own deliberate act, but the evangelical message should always
lead him to action. Refusing to act leaves a person paralyzed, exactly where he
was previously. But once he acts, he is never the same. It is the apparent
folly of the truth that stands in the way of hundreds who have been convicted
by the Spirit of God. Once I press myself into action, I immediately begin to
live. Anything less is merely existing. The moments I truly live are the
moments when I act with my entire will.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>When
a truth of God is brought home to your soul, never allow it to pass without
acting on it internally in your will, not necessarily externally in your
physical life. Record it with ink and with blood --- work it into your life.
The weakest saint who transacts business with Jesus Christ is liberated the
second he acts and God''s almighty power is available on his behalf. We come up
to the truth of God, confess we are wrong, but go back again. Then we approach
it again and turn back, until we finally learn we have no business going back.
When we are confronted with such a word of truth from our redeeming Lord, we
must move directly to transact business with Him. &quot;Come to Me . . .&quot;
(Mat 11:28</span>). His word <i>come</i> means
&quot;to act.&quot; Yet the last thing we want to do is come. But everyone who
does come knows that, at that very moment, the supernatural power of the life
of God invades him. The dominating power of the world, the flesh, and the devil
is now paralyzed; not by your act, but because your act has joined you to God
and tapped you in to His redemptive power.
