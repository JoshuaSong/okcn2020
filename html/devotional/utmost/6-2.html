<b>Are
You Obsessed by Something?

</b><span>(Psa 25:12)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Are
you obsessed by something? You will probably say, &quot;No, by nothing,&quot;
but all of us are obsessed by something --- usually by ourselves, or, if we are
Christians, by our own experience of the Christian life. But the psalmist says
that we are to be obsessed by God. The abiding awareness of the Christian life
is to be God Himself, not just thoughts about Him. The total being of our life
inside and out is to be absolutely obsessed by the presence of God. A child''s
awareness is so absorbed in his mother that although he is not consciously
thinking of her, when a problem arises, the abiding relationship is that with the
mother. In that same way, we are to &quot;live and move and have our
being&quot; in God (Act 17:28</span>), looking
at everything in relation to Him, because our abiding awareness of Him
continually pushes itself to the forefront of our lives.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>If
we are obsessed by God, nothing else can get into our lives --- not concerns,
nor tribulation, nor worries. And now we understand why our Lord so emphasized
the sin of worrying. How can we dare to be so absolutely unbelieving when God
totally surrounds us? To be obsessed by God is to have an effective barricade
against all the assaults of the enemy.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;He
himself shall dwell in prosperity . . .&quot; (Psa 25:13</span>).
God will cause us to &quot;dwell in prosperity,&quot; keeping us at ease, even
in the midst of tribulation, misunderstanding, and slander, if our &quot;life
is hidden with Christ in God&quot; (Col 3:3</span>).
We rob ourselves of the miraculous, revealed truth of this abiding
companionship with God. &quot;God is our refuge . . .&quot; (<span
>Psa 46:1</span>). Nothing can break through His shelter
of protection.
