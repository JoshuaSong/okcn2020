<b>&quot;By
the Grace of God I Am What I Am&quot;

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>The
way we continually talk about our own inabilities is an insult to our Creator.
To complain over our incompetence is to accuse God falsely of having overlooked
us. Get into the habit of examining from God''s perspective those things that
sound so humble to men. You will be amazed at how unbelievably inappropriate
and disrespectful they are to Him. We say things such as, &quot;Oh, I
shouldn''t claim to be sanctified; I''m not a saint.&quot; But to say that
before God means, &quot;No, Lord, it is impossible for You to save and sanctify
me; there are opportunities I have not had and so many imperfections in my
brain and body; no, Lord, it isn''t possible.&quot; That may sound wonderfully
humble to others, but before God it is an attitude of defiance.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Conversely,
the things that sound humble before God may sound exactly the opposite to
people. To say, &quot;Thank God, I know I am saved and sanctified,&quot; is in
God''s eyes the purest expression of humility. It means you have so completely
surrendered yourself to God that you know He is true. Never worry about whether
what you say sounds humble before others or not. But always be humble before
God, and allow Him to be your all in all.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>There
is only one relationship that really matters, and that is your personal
relationship to your personal Redeemer and Lord. If you maintain that at all
costs, letting everything else go, God will fulfill His purpose through your
life. One individual life may be of priceless value to God''s purposes, and
yours may be that life.
