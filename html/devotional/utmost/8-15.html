<b>The
Evidence of the New Birth

</b><span>(Joh 3:7)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>The
answer to Nicodemus'' question, &quot;How can a man be born when he is
old?&quot; is: Only when he is willing to die to everything in his life,
including his rights, his virtues, and his religion, and becomes willing to
receive into himself a new life that he has never before experienced (<span
>Joh 3:4</span>). This new life exhibits itself in our
conscious repentance and through our unconscious holiness.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/><i>&quot;But
as many as received Him</i>
. . .&quot; (Joh 1:12</span>). Is my knowledge
of Jesus the result of my own internal spiritual perception, or is it only what
I have learned through listening to others? Is there something in my life that
unites me with the Lord Jesus as my personal Savior? My spiritual history must
have as its underlying foundation a personal knowledge of Jesus Christ. To be
born again means that I see Jesus.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;.
. . <i>unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God&quot;</i>(<span
>Joh 3:3</span>). Am I seeking only for the evidence of
God''s kingdom, or am I actually recognizing His absolute sovereign control?
The new birth gives me a new power of vision by which I begin to discern God''s
control. His sovereignty was there all the time, but with God being true to His
nature, I could not see it until I received His very nature myself.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/><i>&quot;Whoever
has been born of God does not sin</i><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:
"Trebuchet MS","sans-serif"'> . . .&quot; (1Jo 3:9</span>).
Am I seeking to stop sinning or have I actually stopped? To be born of God
means that I have His supernatural power to stop sinning. The Bible never asks,
&quot;Should a Christian sin?&quot; The Bible emphatically states that <i>a
Christian must not sin.</i> The work of the new birth is being effective in us
when we do not commit sin. It is not merely that we have the power not to sin,
but that we have actually stopped sinning. Yet 1 John 3:9 does not mean that we
<i>cannot</i> sin ---it simply means that if we will obey the life of God in
us, that we <i>do not have to sin.</i>
