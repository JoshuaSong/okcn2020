<b>The
Spiritually Self-Seeking Church

</b><span>(Eph 4:13)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Reconciliation
means the restoring of the relationship between the entire human race and God,
putting it back to what God designed it to be. This is what Jesus Christ did in
redemption. The church ceases to be spiritual when it becomes self-seeking,
only interested in the development of its own organization. The reconciliation
of the human race according to His plan means realizing Him not only in our
lives individually, but also in our lives collectively. Jesus Christ sent
apostles and teachers for this very purpose --- that the corporate Person of
Christ and His church, made up of many members, might be brought into being and
made known. We are not here to develop a spiritual life of our own, or to enjoy
a quiet spiritual retreat. We are here to have the full realization of Jesus
Christ, for the purpose of building His body.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Am
I building up the body of Christ, or am I only concerned about my own personal
development? The essential thing is my personal relationship with Jesus Christ
--- &quot;. . . that <i>I</i> may know <i>Him</i> . . .&quot; (<span
>Phi 3:10</span>). To fulfill God''s perfect design for
me requires my total surrender --- complete abandonment of myself to Him.
Whenever I only want things for myself, the relationship is distorted. And I
will suffer great humiliation once I come to acknowledge and understand that I
have not really been concerned about realizing Jesus Christ Himself, but only
concerned with knowing what He has done for me.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>My
goal is God Himself, not joy nor peace, 

<br/>Nor
even blessing, but Himself, my God.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Am
I measuring my life by this standard or by something less?
