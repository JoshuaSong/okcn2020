<b>The
Source of Abundant Joy

</b><span>(Rom 8:37)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Paul
was speaking here of the things that might seem likely to separate a saint from
the love of God. But the remarkable thing is that nothing can come between the
love of God and a saint. The things Paul mentioned in this passage can and do
disrupt the close fellowship of our soul with God and separate our natural life
from Him. But none of them is able to come between the love of God and the soul
of a saint on the spiritual level. The underlying foundation of the Christian
faith is the undeserved, limitless miracle of the love of God that was
exhibited on the Cross of Calvary; a love that is not earned and can never be.
Paul said this is the reason that &quot;in all these things we are more than
conquerors.&quot; We are super-victors with a joy that comes from experiencing
the very things which look as if they are going to overwhelm us.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Huge
waves that would frighten an ordinary swimmer produce a tremendous thrill for
the surfer who has ridden them. Let''s apply that to our own circumstances. The
things we try to avoid and fight against --- tribulation, suffering, and
persecution --- are the very things that produce abundant joy in us. &quot;We
are more than conquerors through Him&quot; &quot;in all these things&quot;; not
in spite of them, but in the midst of them. A saint doesn''t know the joy of
the Lord in spite of tribulation, but <i>because</i> of it. Paul said, &quot;I
am exceedingly joyful in all our tribulation&quot; (2Co 7:4</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
undiminished radiance, which is the result of abundant joy, is not built on
anything passing, but on the love of God that nothing can change. And the
experiences of life, whether they are everyday events or terrifying ones, are
powerless to &quot;separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus
our Lord&quot; (Rom 8:39</span>).
