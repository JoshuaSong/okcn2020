<b>His
Temptation and Ours

</b><span>(Heb 4:15)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Until
we are born again, the only kind of temptation we understand is the kind
mentioned in (Jam 1:14</span>), &quot;Each one
is tempted when he is drawn away by his own desires and enticed.&quot; But
through regeneration we are lifted into another realm where there are other
temptations to face, namely, the kind of temptations our Lord faced. The
temptations of Jesus had no appeal to us as unbelievers because they were not
at home in our human nature. Our Lord''s temptations and ours are in different
realms until we are born again and become His brothers. The temptations of
Jesus are not those of a mere man, but the temptations of God as Man. Through
regeneration, the Son of God is formed in us (Gal 4:19</span>),
and in our physical life He has the same setting that He had on earth. Satan
does not tempt us just to make us do wrong things --- he tempts us to make us
lose what God has put into us through regeneration, namely, the possibility of
being of value to God. He does not come to us on the premise of tempting us to
sin, but on the premise of shifting our point of view, and only the Spirit of
God can detect this as a temptation of the devil.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Temptation
means a test of the possessions held within the inner, spiritual part of our
being by a power outside us and foreign to us. This makes the temptation of our
Lord explainable. After Jesus'' baptism, having accepted His mission of being
the One &quot;who takes away the sin of the world&quot; (<span
>Joh 1:29</span>) He &quot;was led up by the Spirit into
the wilderness&quot; (Mat 4:1</span>) and into
the testing devices of the devil. Yet He did not become weary or exhausted. He
went through the temptation &quot;without sin,&quot; and He retained all the
possessions of His spiritual nature completely intact.
