<b>Put
God First

</b><span>(Joh 2:24-25)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/><b>Put
Trust in God First.</b>
Our Lord never put His trust in any person. Yet He was never suspicious, never
bitter, and never lost hope for anyone, because He put His trust in God first.
He trusted absolutely in what God''s grace could do for others. If I put my
trust in human beings first, the end result will be my despair and hopelessness
toward everyone. I will become bitter because I have insisted that people be
what no person can ever be --- absolutely perfect and right. Never trust
anything in yourself or in anyone else, except the grace of God.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/><b>Put
God''s Will First.</b>
&quot;Behold, I have come to do Your will, O God&quot; (Hebrews 10:9)(<span
>Heb 10:9</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>A
person''s obedience is to what he sees to be a need --- our Lord''s obedience
was to the will of His Father. The rallying cry today is, &quot;We must get to
work! The heathen are dying without God. We must go and tell them about
Him.&quot; But we must first make sure that God''s &quot;needs&quot; and His
will in us personally are being met. Jesus said, &quot;. . . tarry . . . until
you are endued with power from on high&quot; (Luk 24:49</span>).
The purpose of our Christian training is to get us into the right relationship
to the &quot;needs&quot; of God and His will. Once God''s &quot;needs&quot; in
us have been met, He will open the way for us to accomplish His will, meeting
His &quot;needs&quot; elsewhere.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/><b>Put
God''s Son First.</b>
&quot;Whoever receives one little child like this in My name receives Me&quot;
(Mat 18:5</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>God
came as a baby, giving and entrusting Himself to me. He expects my personal
life to be a &quot;Bethlehem.&quot; Am I allowing my natural life to be slowly
transformed by the indwelling life of the Son of God? God''s ultimate purpose
is that His Son might be exhibited in me.
