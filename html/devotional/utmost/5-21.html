<b>Having
God''s &quot;Unreasonable&quot; Faith

</b><span>(Mat 6:33)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>When
we look at these words of Jesus, we immediately find them to be the most
revolutionary that human ears have ever heard. &quot;. . . seek <i>first</i>
the kingdom of God . . . .&quot; Even the most spiritually-minded of us argue
the exact opposite, saying, &quot;But I <i>must</i> live; I <i>must</i> make a
certain amount of money; I <i>must</i> be clothed; I <i>must</i> be fed.&quot;
The great concern of our lives is not the kingdom of God but how we are going
to take care of ourselves to live. Jesus reversed the order by telling us to
get the right relationship with God first, maintaining it as the primary
concern of our lives, and never to place our concern on taking care of the
other things of life.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;.
. . <i>do not worry about your life</i> . . .&quot; (<span style='color:
black'>Mat 6:25</span>). Our Lord pointed out that from His standpoint it
is absolutely unreasonable for us to be anxious, worrying about how we will
live. Jesus did not say that the person who takes no thought for anything in
his life is blessed --- no, that person is a fool. But Jesus <i>did</i> teach
that His disciple must make his relationship with God the dominating focus of
his life, and to be cautiously carefree about everything else in comparison to
that. In essence, Jesus was saying, &quot;Don''t make food and drink the
controlling factor of your life, but be focused absolutely on God.&quot; Some
people are careless about what they eat and drink, and they suffer for it; they
are careless about what they wear, having no business looking the way they do;
they are careless with their earthly matters, and God holds them responsible.
Jesus is saying that the greatest concern of life is to place our relationship
with God first, and everything else second.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>It
is one of the most difficult, yet critical, disciplines of the Christian life
to allow the Holy Spirit to bring us into absolute harmony with the teaching of
Jesus in these verses.
