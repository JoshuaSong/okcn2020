<b>Spiritual
Vision Through Personal Purity

</b><span>(Mat 5:8)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Purity
is not innocence --- it is much more than that. Purity is the result of
continued spiritual harmony with God. We have to grow in purity. Our life with
God may be right and our inner purity unblemished, yet occasionally our outer
life may become spotted and stained. God intentionally does not protect us from
this possibility, because this is the way we recognize the necessity of
maintaining our spiritual vision through personal purity. If the outer level of
our spiritual life with God is impaired to the slightest degree, we must put
everything else aside until we make it right. Remember that spiritual vision
depends on our character --- it is <i>&quot;the pure in heart&quot;</i> who
&quot;see God.&quot;

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>God
makes us pure by an act of His sovereign grace, but we still have something
that we must carefully watch. It is through our bodily life coming in contact
with other people and other points of view that we tend to become tarnished.
Not only must our &quot;inner sanctuary&quot; be kept right with God, but also
the &quot;outer courts&quot; must be brought into perfect harmony with the
purity God gives us through His grace. Our spiritual vision and understanding
is immediately blurred when our &quot;outer court&quot; is stained. If we want
to maintain personal intimacy with the Lord Jesus Christ, it will mean refusing
to do or even think certain things. And some things that are acceptable for
others will become unacceptable for us.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>A
practical help in keeping your personal purity unblemished in your relations
with other people is to begin to see them as God does. Say to yourself,
&quot;That man or that woman is <i>perfect in Christ Jesus!</i> That friend or
that relative is <i>perfect in Christ Jesus!&quot;</i>
