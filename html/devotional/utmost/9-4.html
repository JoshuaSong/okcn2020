<b>His!

</b><span>(Joh 17:6)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>A
missionary is someone in whom the Holy Spirit has brought about this
realization: &quot;You are not your own&quot; (1Co 6:19</span>).
To say, &quot;I am not my own,&quot; is to have reached a high point in my
spiritual stature. The true nature of that life in actual everyday confusion is
evidenced by the deliberate giving up of myself to another Person through a
sovereign decision, and that Person is Jesus Christ. The Holy Spirit interprets
and explains the nature of Jesus to me to make me one with my Lord, not that I
might simply become a trophy for His showcase. Our Lord never sent any of His
disciples out on the basis of what He had done for them. It was not until after
the resurrection, when the disciples had perceived through the power of the
Holy Spirit who Jesus really was, that He said, &quot;Go&quot; (<span
>Mat 28:19, Luk 24:49, Act 1:8</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;If
anyone comes to Me and does not hate his father and mother, wife and children,
brothers and sisters, yes, and his own life also, he cannot be My
disciple&quot; (Luk 14:26</span>). He was not
saying that this person cannot be good and upright, but that he cannot be
someone over whom Jesus can write the word <i>Mine.</i> Any one of the
relationships our Lord mentions in this verse can compete with our relationship
with Him. I may prefer to belong to my mother, or to my wife, or to myself, but
if that is the case, then, Jesus said, &quot;[You] cannot be My disciple.&quot;
This does not mean that I will not be saved, but it does mean that I cannot be
entirely <i>His.</i>

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Our
Lord makes His disciple His very own possession, becoming responsible for him.
&quot;. . . you shall be witnesses to Me . . .&quot; (<span
>Act 1:8</span>). The desire that comes into a disciple
is not one of <i>doing</i> anything for Jesus, but of <i>being</i> a perfect
delight to Him. The missionary''s secret is truly being able to say, &quot;I am
His, and He is accomplishing His work and His purposes through me.&quot;

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Be
entirely His!
