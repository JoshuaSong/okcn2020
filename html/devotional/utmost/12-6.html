</span>&nbsp;

<br/>It
is the will of God that human beings should get into a right-standing
relationship with Him, and His covenants are designed for this purpose. Why
doesn''t God save me? He has accomplished and provided for my salvation, but I
have not yet entered into a relationship with Him. Why doesn''t God do
everything we ask? He has done it. The point is --- will I step into that
covenant relationship? All the great blessings of God are finished and
complete, but they are not mine until I enter into a relationship with Him on
the basis of His covenant.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Waiting
for God to act is fleshly unbelief. It means that I have no faith in Him. I
wait for Him to do something in me so I may trust in that. But God won''t do
it, because that is not the basis of the God-and-man relationship. Man must go
beyond the physical body and feelings in his covenant with God, just as God goes
beyond Himself in reaching out with His covenant to man. It is a question of
faith in God --- a very rare thing. We only have faith in our feelings. I
don''t believe God until He puts something tangible in my hand, so that I know
I have it. Then I say, &quot;Now I believe.&quot; There is no faith exhibited
in that. God says, <i>&quot;Look to Me,</i> and be saved . . .&quot; (<span
>Isa 45:22</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>When
I have really transacted business with God on the basis of His covenant,
letting everything else go, there is no sense of personal achievement --- no
human ingredient in it at all. Instead, there is a complete overwhelming sense
of being brought into union with God, and my life is transformed and radiates
peace and joy.
