<b>Getting
There

</b><span>(Mat 11:28)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/><b>Where
sin and sorrow stops, and the song of the saint starts.</b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Trebuchet MS","sans-serif"'> Do I really want to
get there? I can right now. The questions that truly matter in life are
remarkably few, and they are all answered by these words --- &quot;Come to
Me.&quot; Our Lord''s words are not, &quot;Do this, or don''t do that,&quot;
but --- &quot;Come to me.&quot; If I will simply come to Jesus, my real life
will be brought into harmony with my real desires. I will actually cease from
sin, and will find the song of the Lord beginning in my life.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Have
you ever come to Jesus? Look at the stubbornness of your heart. You would
rather do anything than this one simple childlike thing --- &quot;Come to
Me.&quot; If you really want to experience ceasing from sin, you must come to
Jesus.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Jesus
Christ makes Himself the test to determine your genuineness. Look how He used
the word <i>come.</i> At the most unexpected moments in your life there is this
whisper of the Lord ---&quot;Come to Me,&quot; and you are immediately drawn to
Him. Personal contact with Jesus changes everything. Be &quot;foolish&quot;
enough to come and commit yourself to what He says. The attitude necessary for
you to come to Him is one where your will has made the determination to let go
of everything and deliberately commit it all to Him.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;.
. . and I will give you rest&quot; --- that is, &quot;I will sustain you,
causing you to stand firm.&quot; He is not saying, &quot;I will put you to bed,
hold your hand, and sing you to sleep.&quot; But, in essence, He is saying,
&quot;I will get you out of bed --- out of your listlessness and exhaustion,
and out of your condition of being half dead while you are still alive. I will
penetrate you with the spirit of life, and you will be sustained by the
perfection of vital activity.&quot; Yet we become so weak and pitiful and talk
about &quot;suffering&quot; the will of the Lord! Where is the majestic
vitality and the power of the Son of God in that?
