<b>Unquestion
Revelation

</b><span>(Joh 16:23)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>When
is &quot;that day&quot;? It is when the ascended Lord makes you one with the
Father. &quot;In that day&quot; you will be one with the Father just as Jesus
is, and He said, &quot;In that day you will ask Me nothing.&quot; Until the
resurrection life of Jesus is fully exhibited in you, you have questions about
many things. Then after a while you find that all your questions are gone ---
you don''t seem to have any left to ask. You have come to the point of total
reliance on the resurrection life of Jesus, which brings you into complete
oneness with the purpose of God. Are you living that life now? If not, why
aren''t you?

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;In
that day&quot; there may be any number of things still hidden to your
understanding, but they will not come between your heart and God. &quot;In that
day you will ask Me nothing&quot; --- you will not need to ask, because you
will be certain that God will reveal things in accordance with His will. The
faith and peace of John 14:1 (Joh 14:1</span>)
has become the real attitude of your heart, and there are no more questions to
be asked. If anything is a mystery to you and is coming between you and God,
never look for the explanation in your mind, but look for it in your spirit,
your true inner nature --- that is where the problem is. Once your inner
spiritual nature is willing to submit to the life of Jesus, your understanding
will be perfectly clear, and you will come to the place where there is no
distance between the Father and you, His child, because the Lord has made you
one. &quot;In that day you will ask Me nothing.&quot;
