<b>&quot;Do
Not Quench the Spirit&quot;

</b><span>(1Th 5:19)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>The
voice of the Spirit of God is as gentle as a summer breeze --- so gentle that
unless you are living in complete fellowship and oneness with God, you will
never hear it. The sense of warning and restraint that the Spirit gives comes
to us in the most amazingly gentle ways. And if you are not sensitive enough to
detect His voice, you will quench it, and your spiritual life will be impaired.
This sense of restraint will always come as a &quot;still small voice&quot; (<span
>1Ki 19:12</span>), so faint that no one except a saint
of God will notice it.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Beware
if in sharing your personal testimony you continually have to look back,
saying, &quot;Once, a number of years ago, I was saved.&quot; If you have put
your &quot;hand to the plow&quot; and are walking in the light, there is no
&quot;looking back&quot; --- the past is instilled into the present wonder of
fellowship and oneness with God (Luk 9:62,
1Jo 1:6-7</span>). If you get out of the light, you become a sentimental
Christian, and live only on your memories, and your testimony will have a hard
metallic ring to it. Beware of trying to cover up your present refusal to
&quot;walk in the light&quot; by recalling your past experiences when you did
&quot;walk in the light&quot; (1Jo 1:7</span>).
When-ever the Spirit gives you that sense of restraint, call a halt and make
things right, or else you will go on quenching and grieving Him without even
knowing it.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Suppose
God brings you to a crisis and you almost endure it, but not completely. He
will engineer the crisis again, but this time some of the intensity will be
lost. You will have less discernment and more humiliation at having disobeyed.
If you continue to grieve His Spirit, there will come a time when that crisis
cannot be repeated, because you have totally quenched Him. But if you will go
on through the crisis, your life will become a hymn of praise to God. Never
become attached to anything that continues to hurt God. For you to be free of
it, God must be allowed to hurt whatever it may be.
