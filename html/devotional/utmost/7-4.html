<b>One
of God''s Great &quot;Don''ts&quot;

</b><span>(Psa 37:8)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Fretting
means getting ourselves &quot;out of joint&quot; mentally or spiritually. It is
one thing to say, &quot;Do not fret,&quot; but something very different to have
such a nature that you find yourself unable to fret. It''s easy to say,
&quot;Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for Him&quot; (<span
>Psa 37:7</span>) until our own little world is turned
upside down and we are forced to live in confusion and agony like so many other
people. Is it possible to &quot;rest in the Lord&quot; then? If this &quot;Do
not&quot; doesn''t work there, then it will not work anywhere. This &quot;Do
not&quot; must work during our days of difficulty and uncertainty, as well as
our peaceful days, or it will never work. And if it will not work in your
particular case, it will not work for anyone else. Resting in the Lord is not
dependent on your external circumstances at all, but on your relationship with
God Himself.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Worrying
always results in sin. We tend to think that a little anxiety and worry are
simply an indication of how wise we really are, yet it is actually a much
better indication of just how wicked we are. Fretting rises from our
determination to have our own way. Our Lord never worried and was never
anxious, because His purpose was never to accomplish His own plans but to
fulfill God''s plans. Fretting is wickedness for a child of God.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Have
you been propping up that foolish soul of yours with the idea that your
circumstances are too much for God to handle? Set all your opinions and
speculations aside and &quot;abide under the shadow of the Almighty&quot; (<span
>Psa 91:1</span>). Deliberately tell God that you will
not fret about whatever concerns you. All our fretting and worrying is caused
by planning without God.
