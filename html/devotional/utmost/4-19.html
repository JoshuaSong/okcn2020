<b>Beware
of the Least Likely Temptation

</b><span>(1Ki 2:28)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Joab
withstood the greatest test of his life, remaining absolutely loyal to David by
not turning to follow after the fascinating and ambitious Absalom. Yet toward
the end of his life he turned to follow after the weak and cowardly Adonijah.
Always remain alert to the fact that where one person has turned back is
exactly where anyone may be tempted to turn back (1Co 10:11-13</span>).
You may have just victoriously gone through a great crisis, but now be alert
about the things that may appear to be the least likely to tempt you. Beware of
thinking that the areas of your life where you have experienced victory in the
past are now the least likely to cause you to stumble and fall.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>We
are apt to say, &quot;It is not at all likely that having been through the
greatest crisis of my life I would now turn back to the things of the
world.&quot; Do not try to predict where the temptation will come; it is the
least likely thing that is the real danger. It is in the aftermath of a great
spiritual event that the least likely things begin to have an effect. They may
not be forceful and dominant, but they are there. And if you are not careful to
be forewarned, they will trip you. You have remained true to God under great
and intense trials --- now beware of the undercurrent. Do not be abnormally
examining your inner self, looking forward with dread, but stay alert; keep
your memory sharp before God. Unguarded strength is actually a double weakness,
because that is where the least likely temptations will be effective in sapping
strength. The Bible characters stumbled over their strong points, never their
weak ones.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;.
. . kept by the power of God . . .&quot; --- that is the only safety. (<span
>1Pe 1:5</span>).
