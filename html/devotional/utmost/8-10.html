<b>The
Holy Suffering of the Saint

</b><span>(1Pe 4:19)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Choosing
to suffer means that there must be something wrong with you, but choosing
God''s will --- even if it means you will suffer --- is something very
different. No normal, healthy saint ever chooses suffering; he simply chooses
God''s will, just as Jesus did, whether it means suffering or not. And no saint
should ever dare to interfere with the lesson of suffering being taught in
another saint''s life.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
saint who satisfies the heart of Jesus will make other saints strong and mature
for God. But the people used to strengthen us are never those who sympathize
with us; in fact, we are hindered by those who give us their sympathy, because
sympathy only serves to weaken us. No one better understands a saint than the
saint who is as close and as intimate with Jesus as possible. If we accept the
sympathy of another saint, our spontaneous feeling is, &quot;God is dealing too
harshly with me and making my life too difficult.&quot; That is why Jesus said
that self-pity was of the devil (Mat 16:21-23</span>).
We must be merciful to God''s reputation. It is easy for us to tarnish God''s
character because He never argues back; He never tries to defend or vindicate
Himself. Beware of thinking that Jesus needed sympathy during His life on
earth. He refused the sympathy of people because in His great wisdom He knew
that no one on earth understood His purpose (Mat 16:23</span>).
He accepted only the sympathy of His Father and the angels (<span
>Luk 15:10</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Look
at God''s incredible waste of His saints, according to the world''s judgment.
God seems to plant His saints in the most useless places. And then we say,
&quot;God intends for me to be here because I am so useful to Him.&quot; Yet
Jesus never measured His life by how or where He was of the greatest use. God
places His saints where they will bring the most glory to Him, and we are
totally incapable of judging where that may be.
