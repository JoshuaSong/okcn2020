<b>Fountains
of Blessings

</b><span>(Joh 4:14)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>The
picture our Lord described here is not that of a simple stream of water, but an
overflowing fountain. Continue to &quot;be filled&quot; (<span
>Eph 5:18</span>) and the sweetness of your vital
relationship to Jesus will flow as generously out of you as it has been given
to you. If you find that His life is not springing up as it should, you are to
blame --- something is obstructing the flow. Was Jesus saying to stay focused
on the Source so that you may be blessed personally? No, you are to focus on
the Source so that out of you &quot;will flow rivers of living water&quot; ---
irrepressible life (Joh 7:38</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>We
are to be fountains through which Jesus can flow as &quot;rivers of living
water&quot; in blessing to everyone. Yet some of us are like the Dead Sea,
always receiving but never giving, because our relationship is not right with
the Lord Jesus. As surely as we receive blessings from Him, He will pour out
blessings through us. But whenever the blessings are not being poured out in
the same measure they are received, there is a defect in our relationship with
Him. Is there anything between you and Jesus Christ? Is there anything
hindering your faith in Him? If not, then Jesus says that out of you &quot;will
flow rivers of living water.&quot; It is not a blessing that you pass on, or an
experience that you share with others, but a river that continually flows
through you. Stay at the Source, closely guarding your faith in Jesus Christ
and your relationship to Him, and there will be a steady flow into the lives of
others with no dryness or deadness whatsoever.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Is
it excessive to say that rivers will flow out of one individual believer? Do
you look at yourself and say, &quot;But I don''t see the rivers&quot;? Through
the history of God''s work you will usually find that He has started with the
obscure, the unknown, the ignored, but those who have been steadfastly true to
Jesus Christ.
