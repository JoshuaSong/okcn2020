<b>&quot;You
Are Not Your Own&quot;

</b><span>(1Co 6:19)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>There
is no such thing as a private life, or a place to hide in this world, for a man
or woman who is intimately aware of and shares in the sufferings of Jesus
Christ. God divides the private life of His saints and makes it a highway for
the world on one hand and for Himself on the other. No human being can stand
that unless he is identified with Jesus Christ. We are not sanctified for
ourselves. We are called into intimacy with the gospel, and things happen that
appear to have nothing to do with us. But God is getting us into fellowship
with Himself. Let Him have His way. If you refuse, you will be of no value to
God in His redemptive work in the world, but will be a hindrance and a
stumbling block.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
first thing God does is get us grounded on strong reality and truth. He does
this until our cares for ourselves individually have been brought into
submission to His way for the purpose of His redemption. Why shouldn''t we
experience heartbreak? Through those doorways God is opening up ways of
fellowship with His Son. Most of us collapse at the first grip of pain. We sit
down at the door of God''s purpose and enter a slow death through self-pity.
And all the so-called Christian sympathy of others helps us to our deathbed.
But God will not. He comes with the grip of the pierced hand of His Son, as if
to say, &quot;Enter into fellowship with Me; arise and shine.&quot; If God can
accomplish His purposes in this world through a broken heart, then why not
thank Him for breaking yours?
