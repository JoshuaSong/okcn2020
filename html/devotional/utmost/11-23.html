<b>The
Distraction of Contempt

</b><span>(Psa 123:3)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>What
we must beware of is not damage to our belief in God but damage to our
Christian disposition or state of mind. &quot;Take heed to your spirit, that
you do not deal treacherously&quot; (Mal 2:16</span>).
Our state of mind is powerful in its effects. It can be the enemy that
penetrates right into our soul and distracts our mind from God. There are
certain attitudes we should never dare to indulge. If we do, we will find they
have distracted us from faith in God. Until we get back into a quiet mood before
Him, our faith is of no value, and our confidence in the flesh and in human
ingenuity is what rules our lives.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Beware
of &quot;the cares of this world . . .&quot; (Mar 4:19</span>).
They are the very things that produce the wrong attitudes in our soul. It is
incredible what enormous power there is in simple things to distract our
attention away from God. Refuse to be swamped by &quot;the cares of this
world.&quot;

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Another
thing that distracts us is our passion for vindication. St. Augustine prayed,
&quot;O Lord, deliver me from this lust of always vindicating myself.&quot;
Such a need for constant vindication destroys our soul''s faith in God. Don''t
say, &quot;I must explain myself,&quot; or, &quot;I must get people to
understand.&quot; Our Lord never explained anything --- He left the
misunderstandings or misconceptions of others to correct themselves.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>When
we discern that other people are not growing spiritually and allow that
discernment to turn to criticism, we block our fellowship with God. God never
gives us discernment so that we may criticize, but that we may intercede.
