<b>The
Unsurpassed Intimacy of Tested Faith

</b><span>(Joh 11:40)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Every
time you venture out in your life of faith, you will find something in your
circumstances that, from a commonsense standpoint, will flatly contradict your
faith. But common sense is not faith, and faith is not common sense. In fact,
they are as different as the natural life and the spiritual. Can you trust
Jesus Christ where your common sense cannot trust Him? Can you venture out with
courage on the words of Jesus Christ, while the realities of your commonsense
life continue to shout, &quot;It''s all a lie&quot;? When you are on the
mountaintop, it''s easy to say, &quot;Oh yes, I believe God can do it,&quot;
but you have to come down from the mountain to the demon-possessed valley and
face the realities that scoff at your Mount-of-Transfiguration belief (<span
>Luk 9:28-42</span>). Every time my theology becomes
clear to my own mind, I encounter something that contradicts it. As soon as I
say, &quot;I believe ''God shall supply all [my] need,'' &quot; the testing of
my faith begins (Phi 4:19</span>). When my
strength runs dry and my vision is blinded, will I endure this trial of my
faith victoriously or will I turn back in defeat?

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Faith
must be tested, because it can only become your intimate possession through
conflict. What is challenging your faith right now? The test will either prove
your faith right, or it will kill it. Jesus said, &quot;Blessed is he who is
not offended because of Me&quot; (Mat 11:6</span>).
The ultimate thing is confidence in Jesus. &quot;We have become partakers of
Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end . .
.&quot; (Heb 3:14</span>). Believe steadfastly
on Him and everything that challenges you will strengthen your faith. There is
continual testing in the life of faith up to the point of our physical death,
which is the last great test. Faith is absolute trust in God --- trust that
could never imagine that He would forsake us (Heb 13:5-6</span>).
