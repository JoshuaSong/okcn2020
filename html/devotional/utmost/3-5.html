<b>Is
He Really My Lord?

</b><span>(Act 20:24)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Joy
comes from seeing the complete fulfillment of the specific purpose for which I
was created and born again, not from successfully doing something of my own
choosing. The joy our Lord experienced came from doing what the Father sent Him
to do. And He says to us, &quot;As the Father has sent Me, I also send
you&quot; (Joh 20:21</span>). Have you
received a ministry from the Lord? If so, you must be faithful to it --- to
consider your life valuable only for the purpose of fulfilling that ministry.
Knowing that you have done what Jesus sent you to do, think how satisfying it
will be to hear Him say to you, &quot;Well done, good and faithful
servant&quot; (Mat 25:21</span>). We each have
to find a niche in life, and spiritually we find it when we receive a ministry
from the Lord. To do this we must have close fellowship with Jesus and must
know Him as more than our personal Savior. And we must be willing to experience
the full impact of (Act 9:16</span>) ---
&quot;I will show him how many things he must suffer <i>for My name''s
sake.&quot;</i>

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;Do
you love Me?&quot; Then, &quot;Feed My sheep&quot; (Joh 21:17</span>).
He is not offering us a choice of how we can serve Him; He is asking for
absolute loyalty to His commission, a faithfulness to what we discern when we
are in the closest possible fellowship with God. If you have received a ministry
from the Lord Jesus, you will know that the need is not the same as the call
--- the need is the opportunity to exercise the call. The call is to be
faithful to the ministry you received when you were in true fellowship with
Him. This does not imply that there is a whole series of differing ministries
marked out for you. It does mean that you must be sensitive to what God has
called you to do, and this may sometimes require ignoring demands for service
in other areas.
