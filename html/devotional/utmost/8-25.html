<b>Sacrifice
and Friendship

</b><span>(Joh 15:15)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>We
will never know the joy of self-sacrifice until we surrender in every detail of
our lives. Yet self-surrender is the most difficult thing for us to do. We make
it conditional by saying, &quot;I''ll surrender if . . . !&quot; Or we approach
it by saying, &quot;I suppose I have to devote my life to God.&quot; We will
never find the joy of self-sacrifice in either of these ways.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>But
as soon as we do totally surrender, abandoning ourselves to Jesus, the Holy
Spirit gives us a taste of His joy. The ultimate goal of self-sacrifice is to
lay down our lives for our Friend (Joh 15:13-14</span>).
When the Holy Spirit comes into our lives, our greatest desire is to lay down
our lives for Jesus. Yet the thought of self-sacrifice never even crosses our
minds, because sacrifice is the Holy Spirit''s ultimate expression of love.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Our
Lord is our example of a life of self-sacrifice, and He perfectly exemplified (<span
>Psa 40:8</span>), &quot;I delight to do Your will, O my
God . . . .&quot; He endured tremendous personal sacrifice, yet with
overflowing joy. Have I ever yielded myself in absolute submission to Jesus
Christ? If He is not the One to whom I am looking for direction and guidance,
then there is no benefit in my sacrifice. But when my sacrifice is made with my
eyes focused on Him, slowly but surely His molding influence becomes evident in
my life (Heb 12:1-2</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Beware
of letting your natural desires hinder your walk in love before God. One of the
cruelest ways to kill natural love is through the rejection that results from
having built the love on natural desires. But the one true desire of a saint is
the Lord Jesus. Love for God is not something sentimental or emotional --- for
a saint to love as God loves is the most practical thing imaginable.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;I
have called you friends. . . .&quot; Our friendship with Jesus is based on the
new life He created in us, which has no resemblance or attraction to our old
life but only to the life of God. It is a life that is completely humble, pure,
and devoted to God.
