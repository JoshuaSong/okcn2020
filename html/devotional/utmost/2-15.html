<b>The
Inspiration of Spiritual Initiative

</b><span>(Eph 5:14)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Not
all initiative, the willingness to take the first step, is inspired by God.
Someone may say to you, &quot;Get up and get going! Take your reluctance by the
throat and throw it overboard --- just do what needs to be done!&quot; That is
what we mean by ordinary human initiative. But when the Spirit of God comes to
us and says, in effect, &quot;Get up and get going,&quot; suddenly we find that
the initiative is inspired.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>We
all have many dreams and aspirations when we are young, but sooner or later we
realize we have no power to accomplish them. We cannot do the things we long to
do, so our tendency is to think of our dreams and aspirations as dead. But God
comes and says to us, &quot;Arise from the dead . . . .&quot; When God sends
His inspiration, it comes to us with such miraculous power that we are able to
&quot;arise from the dead&quot; and do the impossible. The remarkable thing
about spiritual initiative is that the life and power comes after we &quot;get
up and get going.&quot; God does not give us overcoming life --- He gives us
life <i>as we overcome.</i> When the inspiration of God comes, and He says,
&quot;Arise from the dead . . . ,&quot; we have to get ourselves up; God will
not lift us up. Our Lord said to the man with the withered hand, &quot;Stretch
out your hand&quot; (Mat 12:13</span>). As
soon as the man did so, his hand was healed. But he had to take the initiative.
If we will take the initiative to overcome, we will find that we have the
inspiration of God, because He immediately gives us the power of life.
