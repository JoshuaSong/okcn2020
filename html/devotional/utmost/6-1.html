<b>The
Staggering Question

</b><span>(Eze 37:3)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Can
a sinner be turned into a saint? Can a twisted life be made right? There is
only one appropriate answer --- &quot;O Lord God, You know&quot; (<span
>Eze 37:3</span>). Never forge ahead with your religious
common sense and say, &quot;Oh, yes, with just a little more Bible reading,
devotional time, and prayer, I see how it can be done.&quot;

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>It
is much easier to <i>do</i> something than to trust in God; we see the activity
and mistake panic for inspiration. That is why we see so few fellow workers <i>with</i>
God, yet so many people working <i>for</i> God. We would much rather work for
God than believe in Him. Do I really believe that God will do in me what I
cannot do? The degree of hopelessness I have for others comes from never
realizing that God has done anything for me. Is my own personal experience such
a wonderful realization of God''s power and might that I can never have a sense
of hopelessness for anyone else I see? Has any spiritual work been accomplished
in me at all? The degree of panic activity in my life is equal to the degree of
my lack of personal spiritual experience.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;Behold,
O My people, I will open your graves . . .&quot; (Eze 37:12</span>).
When God wants to show you what human nature is like separated from Himself, He
shows it to you in yourself. If the Spirit of God has ever given you a vision
of what you are apart from the grace of God (and He will only do this when His
Spirit is at work in you), then you know that in reality there is no criminal
half as bad as you yourself could be without His grace. My &quot;grave&quot;
has been opened by God and &quot;I know that in me (that is, in my flesh)
nothing good dwells&quot; (Rom 7:18</span>).
God''s Spirit continually reveals to His children what human nature is like
apart from His grace.
