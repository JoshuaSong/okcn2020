<b>Repentance

</b><span>(2Co 7:10)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Conviction
of sin is best described in the words: 

<br/>My
sins, my sins, my Savior,

<br/>How
sad on Thee they fall. 

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Conviction
of sin is one of the most uncommon things that ever happens to a person. It is
the beginning of an understanding of God. Jesus Christ said that when the Holy
Spirit came He would convict people of sin (Joh 16:8</span>).
And when the Holy Spirit stirs a person''s conscience and brings him into the
presence of God, it is not that person''s relationship with others that bothers
him but his relationship with God ---&quot;Against You, You only, have I
sinned, and done this evil in your sight . . .&quot; (<span
>Psa 51:4</span>). The wonders of conviction of sin,
forgiveness, and holiness are so interwoven that it is only the forgiven person
who is truly holy. He proves he is forgiven by being the opposite of what he
was previously, by the grace of God. Repentance always brings a person to the
point of saying, &quot;I have sinned.&quot; The surest sign that God is at work
in his life is when he says that and means it. Anything less is simply sorrow
for having made foolish mistakes --- a reflex action caused by self-disgust.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
entrance into the kingdom of God is through the sharp, sudden pains of
repentance colliding with man''s respectable &quot;goodness.&quot; Then the
Holy Spirit, who produces these struggles, begins the formation of the Son of
God in the person''s life (Gal 4:19</span>).
This new life will reveal itself in conscious repentance followed by
unconscious holiness, never the other way around. The foundation of
Christianity is repentance. Strictly speaking, a person cannot repent when he
chooses --- repentance is a gift of God. The old Puritans used to pray for
&quot;the gift of tears.&quot; If you ever cease to understand the value of
repentance, you allow yourself to remain in sin. Examine yourself to see if you
have forgotten how to be truly repentant.
