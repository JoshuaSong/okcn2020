<b>What''s
Next To Do?

style='font-family:"Trebuchet MS","sans-serif"'> If you yourself do not cut the
lines that tie you to the dock, God will have to use a storm to sever them and
to send you out to sea. Put everything in your life afloat upon God, going out
to sea on the great swelling tide of His purpose, and your eyes will be opened.
If you believe in Jesus, you are not to spend all your time in the calm waters
just inside the harbor, full of joy, but always tied to the dock. You have to
get out past the harbor into the great depths of God, and begin to know things
for yourself --- begin to have spiritual discernment.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>When
you know that you should do something and you do it, immediately you know more.
Examine where you have become sluggish, where you began losing interest
spiritually, and you will find that it goes back to a point where you did not
do something you knew you should do. You did not do it because there seemed to
be no immediate call to do it. But now you have no insight or discernment, and
at a time of crisis you are spiritually distracted instead of spiritually
self-controlled. It is a dangerous thing to refuse to continue learning and
knowing more.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
counterfeit of obedience is a state of mind in which you create your own
opportunities to sacrifice yourself, and your zeal and enthusiasm are mistaken
for discernment. It is easier to sacrifice yourself than to fulfill your
spiritual destiny, which is stated in (Rom 12:1-2</span>).
It is much better to fulfill the purpose of God in your life by discerning His
will than it is to perform great acts of self-sacrifice. &quot;Behold, to obey
is better than sacrifice . . .&quot; (1Sa 15:22</span>).
Beware of paying attention or going back to what you once were, when God wants
you to be something that you have never been. &quot;If anyone wills to do His
will, he shall know . . .&quot; (Joh 7:17</span>).
