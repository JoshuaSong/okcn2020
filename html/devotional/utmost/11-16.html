<b>Still
Human!

</b><span>(1Co 10:31)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>In
the Scriptures, the great miracle of the incarnation slips into the ordinary
life of a child; the great miracle of the transfiguration fades into the
demon-possessed valley below; the glory of the resurrection descends into a
breakfast on the seashore. This is not an anticlimax, but a great revelation of
God.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>We
have a tendency to look for wonder in our experience, and we mistake heroic
actions for real heroes. It''s one thing to go through a crisis grandly, yet
quite another to go through every day glorifying God when there is no witness,
no limelight, and no one paying even the remotest attention to us. If we are
not looking for halos, we at least want something that will make people say,
&quot;What a wonderful man of prayer he is!&quot; or, &quot;What a great woman of
devotion she is!&quot; If you are properly devoted to the Lord Jesus, you have
reached the lofty height where no one would ever notice you personally. All
that is noticed is the power of God coming through you all the time.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>We
want to be able to say, &quot;Oh, I have had a wonderful call from God!&quot;
But to do even the most humbling tasks to the glory of God takes the Almighty
God Incarnate working in us. To be utterly unnoticeable requires God''s Spirit
in us making us absolutely humanly His. The true test of a saint''s life is not
successfulness but faithfulness on the human level of life. We tend to set up
success in Christian work as our purpose, but our purpose should be to display
the glory of God in human life, to live a life &quot;hidden with Christ in God&quot;
in our everyday human conditions (Col 3:3</span>).
Our human relationships are the very conditions in which the ideal life of God
should be exhibited.
