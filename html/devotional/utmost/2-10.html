<b>Is
Your Mind Stayed on God?

</b><span>(Isa 26:3)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Is
your mind stayed on God or is it starved? Starvation of the mind, caused by
neglect, is one of the chief sources of exhaustion and weakness in a servant''s
life. If you have never used your mind to place yourself before God, begin to
do it now. There is no reason to wait for God to come to you. You must turn
your thoughts and your eyes away from the face of idols and look to Him and be
saved (Isa 45:22</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Your
mind is the greatest gift God has given you and it ought to be devoted entirely
to Him. You should seek to be &quot;bringing every thought into captivity to
the obedience of Christ . . .&quot; (2Co 10:5</span>).
This will be one of the greatest assets of your faith when a time of trial
comes, because then your faith and the Spirit of God will work together. When
you have thoughts and ideas that are worthy of credit to God, learn to compare
and associate them with all that happens in nature --- the rising and the
setting of the sun, the shining of the moon and the stars, and the changing of
the seasons. You will begin to see that your thoughts are from God as well, and
your mind will no longer be at the mercy of your impulsive thinking, but will
always be used in service to God.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;We
have sinned with our fathers . . . [and] . . . did not remember . . .&quot; (<span
>Psa 106:6-7</span>). Then prod your memory and wake up
immediately. Don''t say to yourself, &quot;But God is not talking to me right
now.&quot; He ought to be. Remember whose you are and whom you serve. Encourage
yourself to remember, and your affection for God will increase tenfold. Your
mind will no longer be starved, but will be quick and enthusiastic, and your
hope will be inexpressibly bright.
