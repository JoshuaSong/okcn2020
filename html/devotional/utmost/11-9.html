<b>Sacred
Service

</b><span>(Col 1:24)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>The
Christian worker has to be a sacred &quot;go-between.&quot; He must be so
closely identified with his Lord and the reality of His redemption that Christ
can continually bring His creating life through him. I am not referring to the
strength of one individual''s personality being superimposed on another, but
the real presence of Christ coming through every aspect of the worker''s life.
When we preach the historical facts of the life and death of our Lord as they
are conveyed in the New Testament, our words are made sacred. God uses these
words, on the basis of His redemption, to create something in those who listen
which otherwise could never have been created. If we simply preach the effects
of redemption in the human life instead of the revealed, divine truth regarding
Jesus Himself, the result is not new birth in those who listen. The result is a
refined religious lifestyle, and the Spirit of God cannot witness to it because
such preaching is in a realm other than His. We must make sure that we are
living in such harmony with God that as we proclaim His truth He can create in
others those things which He alone can do.

<br/>When
we say, &quot;What a wonderful personality, what a fascinating person, and what
wonderful insight!&quot; then what opportunity does the gospel of God have
through all of that? It cannot get through, because the attraction is to the
messenger and not the message. If a person attracts through his personality,
that becomes his appeal. If, however, he is identified with the Lord Himself,
then the appeal becomes what Jesus Christ can do. The danger is to glory in
men, yet Jesus says we are to lift up only <i>Him</i> (<span
>Joh 12:32</span>).
