<b>Don''t
Hurt the Lord

</b><span>(Joh 14:9)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Our
Lord must be repeatedly astounded at us --- astounded at how
&quot;un-simple&quot; we are. It is our own opinions that make us dense and
slow to understand, but when we are simple we are never dense; we have
discernment all the time. Philip expected the future revelation of a tremendous
mystery, but not in Jesus, the Person he thought he already knew. The mystery
of God is not in what is going to be ---- it is now, though we look for it to
be revealed in the future in some overwhelming, momentous event. We have no
reluctance to obey Jesus, but it is highly probable that we are hurting Him by
what we ask ---&quot;Lord, show us the Father . . .&quot; (<span
>Joh 14:8</span>). His response immediately comes back
to us as He says, &quot;Can''t you see Him? He is always right here or He is
nowhere to be found.&quot; We look for God to exhibit Himself <i>to</i> His
children, but God only exhibits Himself <i>in</i> His children. And while others
see the evidence, the child of God does not. We want to be fully aware of what
God is doing in us, but we cannot have complete awareness and expect to remain
reasonable or balanced in our expectations of Him. If all we are asking God to
give us is experiences, and the awareness of those experiences is blocking our
way, we hurt the Lord. The very questions we ask hurt Jesus, because they are
not the questions of a child.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;Let
not your heart be troubled . . .&quot; (Joh 14:1,
Joh 14:27</span>). Am I then hurting Jesus by allowing my heart to be
troubled? . If I believe in Jesus and His attributes, am I living up to my
belief? Am I allowing anything to disturb my heart, or am I allowing any
questions to come in which are unsound or unbalanced? I have to get to the point
of the absolute and unquestionable relationship that takes everything exactly
as it comes from Him. God never guides us at some time in the future, but
always here and now. Realize that the Lord is here <i>now,</i> and the freedom
you receive is immediate.
