<b>The
Proper Perspective

</b><span>(2Co 2:14)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>The
proper perspective of a servant of God must not simply be as near to the
highest as he can get, but it must be <i>the</i> highest. Be careful that you
vigorously maintain God''s perspective, and remember that it must be done every
day, little by little. Don''t think on a finite level. No outside power can
touch the proper perspective.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
proper perspective to maintain is that we are here for only one purpose --- to
be captives marching in the procession of Christ''s triumphs. We are not on
display in God''s showcase --- we are here to exhibit only one thing --- the
&quot;captivity [of our lives] to the obedience of Christ&quot; (<span
>2Co 10:5</span>). How small all the other perspectives
are! For example, the ones that say, &quot;I am standing all alone, battling
for Jesus,&quot; or, &quot;I have to maintain the cause of Christ and hold down
this fort for Him.&quot; But Paul said, in essence, &quot;I am in the
procession of a conqueror, and it doesn''t matter what the difficulties are,
for I am always led in triumph.&quot; Is this idea being worked out practically
in us? Paul''s secret joy was that God took him as a blatant rebel against
Jesus Christ, and made him a captive --- and that became his purpose. It was
Paul''s joy to be a captive of the Lord, and he had no other interest in heaven
or on earth. It is a shameful thing for a Christian to talk about getting the
victory. We should belong so completely to the Victor that it is always His
victory, and &quot;we are more than conquerors through Him . . .&quot; (<span
>Rom 8:37</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;We
are to God the fragrance of Christ . . .&quot; (2Co 2:15</span>).
We are encompassed with the sweet aroma of Jesus, and wherever we go we are a
wonderful refreshment to God.
