<b>Decreasing
for His Purpose

</b><span>(Joh 3:30)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>If
you become a necessity to someone else''s life, you are out of God''s will. As
a servant, your primary responsibility is to be a &quot;friend of the
bridegroom&quot; (Joh 3:29</span>). When you
see a person who is close to grasping the claims of Jesus Christ, you know that
your influence has been used in the right direction. And when you begin to see
that person in the middle of a difficult and painful struggle, don''t try to
prevent it, but pray that his difficulty will grow even ten times stronger,
until no power on earth or in hell could hold him away from Jesus Christ. Over
and over again, we try to be amateur providences in someone''s life. We are
indeed amateurs, coming in and actually preventing God''s will and saying,
&quot;This person should not have to experience this difficulty.&quot; Instead
of being friends of the Bridegroom, our sympathy gets in the way. One day that
person will say to us, &quot;You are a thief; you stole my desire to follow
Jesus, and because of you I lost sight of Him.&quot;

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Beware
of rejoicing with someone over the wrong thing, but always look to rejoice over
the right thing. &quot;. . . the friend of the bridegroom . . . rejoices
greatly because of the bridegroom''s voice. Therefore this joy of mine is
fulfilled. He must increase, but I must decrease&quot; (<span
>Joh 3:29-30</span>). This was spoken with joy, not with
sadness --- at last they were to see the Bridegroom! And John said this was his
joy. It represents a stepping aside, an absolute removal of the servant, never
to be thought of again.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Listen
intently with your entire being until you hear the Bridegroom''s voice in the
life of another person. And never give any thought to what devastation,
difficulties, or sickness it will bring. Just rejoice with godly excitement
that His voice has been heard. You may often have to watch Jesus Christ wreck a
life before He saves it (Mat 10:34</span>).
