<b>The
Missionary''s Master and Teacher

</b><span>(Joh 13:13, Joh 13:16)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>To
have a master and teacher is not the same thing as being mastered and taught.
Having a master and teacher means that there is someone who knows me better
than I know myself, who is closer than a friend, and who understands the
remotest depths of my heart and is able to satisfy them fully. It means having
someone who has made me secure in the knowledge that he has met and solved all
the doubts, uncertainties, and problems in my mind. To have a master and
teacher is this and nothing less --- &quot;. . . for One is your Teacher, the
Christ . . .&quot; (Mat 23:8</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Our
Lord never takes measures to make me do what He wants. Sometimes I wish God
would master and control me to make me do what He wants, but He will not. And
at other times I wish He would leave me alone, and He does not.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;You
call Me Teacher and Lord . . .&quot; --- but is He? <i>Teacher, Master,</i> and
<i>Lord</i> have little place in our vocabulary. We prefer the words <i>Savior,
Sanctifier,</i> and <i>Healer.</i> The only word that truly describes the experience
of being mastered is <i>love,</i> and we know little about love as God reveals
it in His Word. The way we use the word <i>obey</i> is proof of this. In the
Bible, obedience is based on a relationship between equals; for example, that
of a son with his father. Our Lord was not simply God''s servant --- He was His
Son. &quot;. . . <i>though He was a Son,</i> yet He learned obedience. .
.&quot; (Heb 5:8</span>). If we are
consciously aware that we are being mastered, that idea itself is proof that we
have no master. If that is our attitude toward Jesus, we are far away from
having the relationship He wants with us. He wants us in a relationship where
He is so easily our Master and Teacher that we have no conscious awareness of
it --- a relationship where all we know is that we are His to obey.
