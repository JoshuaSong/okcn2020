<b>The
&quot;Go&quot; of Preparation

</b><span>(Mat 5:23-24)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>It
is easy for us to imagine that we will suddenly come to a point in our lives
where we are fully prepared, but preparation is not suddenly accomplished. In
fact, it is a process that must be steadily maintained. It is dangerous to
become settled and complacent in our present level of experience. The Christian
life requires preparation <i>and</i> more preparation.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
sense of sacrifice in the Christian life is readily appealing to a new
Christian. From a human standpoint, the one thing that attracts us to Jesus
Christ is our sense of the heroic, and a close examination of us by our Lord''s
words suddenly puts this tide of enthusiasm to the test. &quot;. . . <i>go</i>
your way. First be reconciled to your brother. . . .&quot; The &quot;go&quot;
of preparation is to allow the Word of God to examine you closely. Your sense
of heroic sacrifice is not good enough. The thing the Holy Spirit will detect
in you is your nature that can never work in His service. And no one but God
can detect that nature in you. Do you have anything to hide from God? If you
do, then let God search you with His light. If there is sin in your life,
don''t just <i>admit</i> it --- <i>confess</i> it. Are you willing to obey your
Lord and Master, whatever the humiliation to your right to yourself may be?

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Never
disregard a conviction that the Holy Spirit brings to you. If it is important
enough for the Spirit of God to bring it to your mind, it is the very thing He
is detecting in you. You were looking for some big thing to give up, while God
is telling you of some tiny thing that must go. But behind that tiny thing lies
the stronghold of obstinacy, and you say, &quot;I will not give up my right to
myself&quot; --- the very thing that God intends you to give up if you are to
be a disciple of Jesus Christ.
