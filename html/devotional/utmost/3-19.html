<b>Abraham''s
Life of Faith

</b><span>(Heb 11:8)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>In
the Old Testament, a person''s relationship with God was seen by the degree of
separation in that person''s life. This separation is exhibited in the life of
Abraham by his separation from his country and his family. When we think of
separation today, we do not mean to be literally separated from those family
members who do not have a personal relationship with God, but to be separated
mentally and morally from their viewpoints. This is what Jesus Christ was
referring to in (Luk 14:26</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Living
a life of faith means never knowing where you are being led. But it does mean
loving and knowing the One who is leading. It is literally a life of <i>faith,</i>
not of understanding and reason --- a life of knowing Him who calls us to go.
Faith is rooted in the knowledge of a Person, and one of the biggest traps we
fall into is the belief that if we have faith, God will surely lead us to
success in the world.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
final stage in the life of faith is the attainment of character, and we
encounter many changes in the process. We feel the presence of God around us
when we pray, yet we are only momentarily changed. We tend to keep going back
to our everyday ways and the glory vanishes. A life of faith is not a life of
one glorious mountaintop experience after another, like soaring on eagles''
wings, but is a life of dayin and dayout consistency; a life of walking without
fainting (Isa 40:31</span>). It is not even a
question of the holiness of sanctification, but of something which comes much
farther down the road. It is a faith that has been tried and proved and has
withstood the test. Abraham is not a type or an example of the holiness of
sanctification, but a type of the life of faith --- a faith, tested and true,
built on the true God. <i>&quot;Abraham believed God</i> . . .&quot; (<span
>Rom 4:3</span>).
