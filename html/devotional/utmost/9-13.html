<b>After
Surrender --- Then What?

</b><span>(Joh 17:4)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>True
surrender is not simply surrender of our external life but surrender of our
will --- and once that is done, surrender is complete. The greatest crisis we
ever face is the surrender of our will. Yet God never forces a person''s will
into surrender, and He never begs. He patiently waits until that person
willingly yields to Him. And once that battle has been fought, it never needs
to be fought again.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/><b>Surrender
for Deliverance.</b>
&quot;Come to Me . . . and I will give you rest&quot; (<span
>Mat 11:28</span>). It is only after we have begun to
experience what salvation really means that we surrender our will to Jesus for
rest. Whatever is causing us a sense of uncertainty is actually a call to our
will --- &quot;Come to Me.&quot; And it is a voluntary coming.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/><b>Surrender
for Devotion.</b>
&quot;If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself . . . &quot; (<span
>Mat 16:24</span>). The surrender here is of my <i>self</i>
to Jesus, with His rest at the heart of my being. He says, &quot;If you want to
be My disciple, you must give up your right to yourself to Me.&quot; And once
this is done, the remainder of your life will exhibit nothing but the evidence
of this surrender, and you never need to be concerned again with what the
future may hold for you. Whatever your circumstances may be, Jesus is totally
sufficient (2Co 12:9, Phi 4:19</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/><b>Surrender
for Death.</b>
&quot;. . . another will gird you . . .&quot; (Joh 21:18-19</span>).
Have you learned what it means to be girded for death? Beware of some surrender
that you make to God in an ecstatic moment in your life, because you are apt to
take it back again. True surrender is a matter of being &quot;united together
[with Jesus] in the likeness of His death&quot; (Rom 6:5</span>)
until nothing ever appeals to you that did not appeal to Him.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>And
after you surrender --- then what? Your entire life should be characterized by
an eagerness to maintain unbroken fellowship and oneness with God.
