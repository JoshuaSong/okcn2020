<b>Am
I Looking To God?

</b><span>(Isa 45:22)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>&nbsp;Do
we expect God to come to us with His blessings and save us? He says, &quot;<i>Look
to Me</i>, and <i>be</i> saved . . . .&quot; The greatest difficulty
spiritually is to concentrate on God, and His blessings are what make it so
difficult. Troubles almost always make us look to God, but His blessings tend
to divert our attention elsewhere. The basic lesson of the Sermon on the Mount
is to narrow all your interests until your mind, heart, and body are focused on
Jesus Christ. &quot;Look to Me . . . .&quot;

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Many
of us have a mental picture of what a Christian should be, and looking at this
image in other Christians'' lives becomes a hindrance to our focusing on God.
This is not salvation --- it is not simple enough. He says, in effect,
&quot;Look to Me and you <i>are</i> saved,&quot; not &quot;You will be saved
someday.&quot; We will find what we are looking for if we will concentrate on
Him. We get distracted from God and irritable with Him while He continues to
say to us, &quot;Look to Me, and be saved . . . .&quot; Our difficulties, our
trials, and our worries about tomorrow all vanish when we look to God.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Wake
yourself up and look to God. Build your hope on Him. No matter how many things
seem to be pressing in on you, be determined to push them aside and look to
Him. &quot;Look to Me . . . .&quot; Salvation <i>is</i> yours the moment you
look.
