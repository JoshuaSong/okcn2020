<b>Redemption
--- Creating the Need it Satisfies

</b><span>(1Co 2:14)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>The
gospel of God creates the sense of need for the gospel. Is the gospel hidden to
those who are servants already? No, Paul said, &quot;But even if our gospel is
veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing, whose minds the god of this
age has blinded, who do not believe . . .&quot; (2Co 4:3-4</span>).
The majority of people think of themselves as being completely moral, and have
no sense of need for the gospel. It is God who creates this sense of need in a
human being, but that person remains totally unaware of his need until God
makes Himself evident. Jesus said, &quot;Ask, and it will be given to you . .
.&quot; (Mat 7:7</span>). But God cannot give
until a man asks. It is not that He wants to withhold something from us, but that
is the plan He has established for the way of redemption. Through our asking,
God puts His process in motion, creating something in us that was nonexistent
until we asked. The inner reality of redemption is that it creates all the
time. And as redemption creates the life of God in us, it also creates the
things which belong to that life. The only thing that can possibly satisfy the
need is what created the need. This is the meaning of redemption --- it creates
and it satisfies.

<br/>Jesus
said, &quot;And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all peoples to
Myself&quot; (Joh 12:32</span>). When we
preach our own experiences, people may be interested, but it awakens no real
sense of need. But once Jesus Christ is &quot;lifted up,&quot; the Spirit of
God creates an awareness of the need for Him. The creative power of the
redemption of God works in the souls of men only through the preaching of the
gospel. It is never the sharing of personal experiences that saves people, but
the truth of redemption. &quot;The words that <i>I</i> speak to you are spirit,
and they are life&quot; (Joh 6:63</span>).
