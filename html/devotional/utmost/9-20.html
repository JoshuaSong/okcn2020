<b>The
Divine Commandment of Life

</b><span>(Mat 5:48)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Our
Lord''s exhortation to us in (Mat 5:38-48</span>)
is to be generous in our behavior toward everyone. Beware of living according
to your natural affections in your spiritual life. Everyone has natural
affections --- some people we like and others we don''t like. Yet we must never
let those likes and dislikes rule our Christian life. &quot;If we walk in the
light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another&quot; (<span
>1Jo 1:7</span>), even those toward whom we have no
affection.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
example our Lord gave us here is not that of a good person, or even of a good
Christian, but of God Himself. &quot;. . . be perfect, just as your Father in
heaven is perfect.&quot; In other words, simply show to the other person what
God has shown to you. And God will give you plenty of real life opportunities
to prove whether or not you are &quot;perfect, just as your Father in heaven is
perfect.&quot; Being a disciple means deliberately identifying yourself with
God''s interests in other people. Jesus says, &quot;A new commandment I give to
you, that you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one
another. By this all will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for
one another&quot; (Joh 13:34-35</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
true expression of Christian character is not in good-doing, but in
God-likeness. If the Spirit of God has transformed you within, you will exhibit
divine characteristics in your life, not just good human characteristics.
God''s life in us expresses itself as <i>God''s</i> life, not as human life
trying to be godly. The secret of a Christian''s life is that the supernatural
becomes natural in him as a result of the grace of God, and the experience of
this becomes evident in the practical, everyday details of life, not in times
of intimate fellowship with God. And when we come in contact with things that
create confusion and a flurry of activity, we find to our own amazement that we
have the power to stay wonderfully poised even in the center of it all.
