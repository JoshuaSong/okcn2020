<b>&quot;My
Joy . . . Your Joy&quot;

</b><span>(Joh 15:11)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>What
was the joy that Jesus had? Joy should not be confused with happiness. In fact,
it is an insult to Jesus Christ to use the word <i>happiness</i> in connection
with Him. The joy of Jesus was His absolute self-surrender and self-sacrifice
to His Father --- the joy of doing that which the Father sent Him to do ---
&quot;. . . who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross . .
.&quot; (Heb 12:2</span>). &quot;I delight to
do Your will, O my God . . .&quot; (Psa 40:8</span>).
Jesus prayed that our joy might continue fulfilling itself until it becomes the
same joy as His. Have I allowed Jesus Christ to introduce His joy to me?

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Living
a full and overflowing life does not rest in bodily health, in circumstances,
nor even in seeing God''s work succeed, but in the perfect understanding of
God, and in the same fellowship and oneness with Him that Jesus Himself
enjoyed. But the first thing that will hinder this joy is the subtle
irritability caused by giving too much thought to our circumstances. Jesus
said, &quot;. . . the cares of this world, . . . choke the word, and it becomes
unfruitful&quot; (Mar 4:19</span>). And before
we even realize what has happened, we are caught up in our cares. All that God
has done for us is merely the threshold --- He wants us to come to the place
where we will be His witnesses and proclaim who Jesus is.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Have
the right relationship with God, finding your joy there, and out of you
&quot;will flow rivers of living water&quot; (Joh 7:38</span>).
Be a fountain through which Jesus can pour His &quot;living water.&quot; Stop
being hypocritical and proud, aware only of yourself, and live &quot;your life
. . . hidden with Christ in God&quot; (Col 3:3</span>).
A person who has the right relationship with God lives a life as natural as
breathing wherever he goes. The lives that have been the greatest blessing to
you are the lives of those people who themselves were unaware of having been a
blessing.
