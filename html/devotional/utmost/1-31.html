<b>The
Call of God

</b><span>(1Co 1:17)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Paul
states here that the call of God is to preach the gospel. But remember what
Paul means by &quot;the gospel,&quot; namely, the reality of redemption in our
Lord Jesus Christ. We are inclined to make sanctification the goal of our
preaching. Paul refers to personal experiences only by way of illustration,
never as the end of the matter. We are not commissioned to preach salvation or
sanctification --- we are commissioned to lift up Jesus Christ (<span
>Joh 12:32</span>). It is an injustice to say that Jesus
Christ labored in redemption to make me a saint. Jesus Christ labored in
redemption to redeem the whole world and to place it perfectly whole and
restored before the throne of God. The fact that we can experience redemption
illustrates the power of its reality, but that experience is a byproduct and
not the goal of redemption. If God were human, how sick and tired He would be
of the constant requests we make for our salvation and for our sanctification.
We burden His energies from morning till night asking for things for ourselves
or for something from which we want to be delivered! When we finally touch the
underlying foundation of the reality of the gospel of God, we will never bother
Him anymore with little personal complaints.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
one passion of Paul''s life was to proclaim the gospel of God. He welcomed
heartbreak, disillusionment, and tribulation for only one reason --- these
things kept him unmovable in his devotion to the gospel of God.
