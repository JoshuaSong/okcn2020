<b>The
Habit of Having No Habits

</b><span>(2Pe 1:8)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>When
we first begin to form a habit, we are fully aware of it. There are times when
we are aware of becoming virtuous and godly, but this awareness should only be
a stage we quickly pass through as we grow spiritually. If we stop at this
stage, we will develop a sense of spiritual pride. The right thing to do with
godly habits is to immerse them in the life of the Lord until they become such
a spontaneous expression of our lives that we are no longer aware of them. Our
spiritual life continually causes us to focus our attention inwardly for the
determined purpose of self-examination, because each of us has some qualities
we have not yet added to our lives.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Your
god may be your little Christian habit --- the habit of prayer or Bible reading
at certain times of your day. Watch how your Father will upset your schedule if
you begin to worship your habit instead of what the habit symbolizes. We say,
&quot;I can''t do that right now; this is my time alone with God.&quot; No,
this is your time alone with your habit. There is a quality that is still
lacking in you. Identify your shortcoming and then look for opportunities to
work into your life that missing quality.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Love
means that there are no visible habits --- that your habits are so immersed in
the Lord that you practice them without realizing it. If you are consciously
aware of your own holiness, you place limitations on yourself from doing
certain things --- things God is not restricting you from at all. This means
there is a missing quality that needs to be added to your life. The only
supernatural life is the life the Lord Jesus lived, and He was at home with God
anywhere. Is there someplace where you are not at home with God? Then allow God
to work through whatever that particular circumstance may be until you increase
in Him, adding His qualities. Your life will then become the simple life of a child.
