<b>The
Missionary''s Goal

</b><span>(Luk 18:31)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>In
our natural life our ambitions change as we grow, but in the Christian life the
goal is given at the very beginning, and the beginning and the end are exactly
the same, namely, our Lord Himself. We start with Christ and we end with Him?
--- &quot;. . . till we all come . . . to the measure of the stature of the
fullness of Christ . . .&quot; (Eph 4:13</span>),
not simply to our own idea of what the Christian life should be. The goal of
the missionary is to do God''s will, not to be useful or to win the lost. A
missionary <i>is</i> useful and he <i>does</i> win the lost, but that is not
his goal. His goal is to do the will of his Lord.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>In
our Lord''s life, Jerusalem was the place where He reached the culmination of
His Father''s will upon the cross, and unless we go there with Jesus we will
have no friendship or fellowship with Him. Nothing ever diverted our Lord on
His way to Jerusalem. He never hurried through certain villages where He was
persecuted, or lingered in others where He was blessed. Neither gratitude nor
ingratitude turned our Lord even the slightest degree away from His purpose to
go &quot;up to Jerusalem.&quot;

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;A
disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master&quot; (<span
>Mat 10:24</span>). In other words, the same things that
happened to our Lord will happen to us on our way to our &quot;Jerusalem.&quot;
There will be works of God exhibited through us, people will get blessed, and
one or two will show gratitude while the rest will show total ingratitude, but
nothing must divert us from going &quot;up to [our] Jerusalem.&quot;

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;.
. . there they crucified Him . . .&quot; (Luk 23:33</span>).
That is what happened when our Lord reached Jerusalem, and that event is the
doorway to our salvation. The saints, however, do not end in crucifixion; by
the Lord''s grace they end in glory. In the meantime our watchword should be
summed up by each of us saying, &quot;I too go ''up to Jerusalem.'' &quot;
