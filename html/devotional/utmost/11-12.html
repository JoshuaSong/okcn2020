<b>The
Changed Life

</b><span>(2Co 5:17)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>What
understanding do you have of the salvation of your soul? The work of salvation
means that in your real life things are dramatically changed. You no longer
look at things in the same way. Your desires are new and the old things have
lost their power to attract you. One of the tests for determining if the work
of salvation in your life is genuine is --- has God changed the things that
really matter to you? If you still yearn for the old things, it is absurd to
talk about being born from above --- you are deceiving yourself. If you are
born again, the Spirit of God makes the change very evident in your real life
and thought. And when a crisis comes, you are the most amazed person on earth
at the wonderful difference there is in you. There is no possibility of
imagining that <i>you</i> did it. It is this complete and amazing change that
is the very evidence that you are saved.

<br/>What
difference has my salvation and sanctification made? For instance, can I stand
in the light of (1Co 13:1-13</span>), or do I
squirm and evade the issue? True salvation, worked out in me by the Holy
Spirit, frees me completely. And as long as I &quot;walk in the light as He is
in the light&quot; (1Jo 1:7</span>), God sees
nothing to rebuke because His life is working itself into every detailed part
of my being, not on the conscious level, but even deeper than my consciousness.
