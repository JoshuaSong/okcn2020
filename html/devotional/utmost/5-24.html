<b>The
Delight of Despair

</b><span>(Rev 1:17)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>It
may be that, like the apostle John, you know Jesus Christ intimately. Yet when
He suddenly appears to you with totally unfamiliar characteristics, the only
thing you can do is fall &quot;at His feet as dead.&quot; There are times when
God cannot reveal Himself in any other way than in His majesty, and it is the
awesomeness of the vision which brings you to the delight of despair. You
experience this joy in hopelessness, realizing that if you are ever to be
raised up it must be by the hand of God.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;He
laid His right hand on me . . .&quot; (Rev 1:17</span>).
In the midst of the awesomeness, a touch comes, and you know it is the right
hand of Jesus Christ. You know it is not the hand of restraint, correction, nor
chastisement, but the right hand of the Everlasting Father. Whenever His hand
is laid upon you, it gives inexpressible peace and comfort, and the sense that
&quot;underneath are the everlasting arms&quot; (Deu 33:27</span>),
full of support, provision, comfort, and strength. And once His touch comes,
nothing at all can throw you into fear again. In the midst of all His ascended
glory, the Lord Jesus comes to speak to an insignificant disciple, saying,
&quot;Do not be afraid&quot; (Rev 1:17</span>).
His tenderness is inexpressibly sweet. Do I know Him like that?

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Take
a look at some of the things that cause despair. There is despair which has no
delight, no limits whatsoever, and no hope of anything brighter. But the
delight of despair comes when &quot;I know that in me (that is, in my flesh)
nothing good dwells . . .&quot; (Rom 7:18</span>).
I delight in knowing that there is something in me which must fall prostrate
before God when He reveals Himself to me, and also in knowing that if I am ever
to be raised up it must be by the hand of God. God can do nothing for me until
I recognize the limits of what is humanly possible, allowing Him to do the
impossible.
