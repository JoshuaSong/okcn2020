<b>What
To Do When Your Burden Is Overwhelming

</b><span>(Psa 55:22)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>We
must recognize the difference between burdens that are right for us to bear and
burdens that are wrong. We should never bear the burdens of sin or doubt, but
there are some burdens placed on us by God which He does not intend to lift
off. God wants us to roll them back on Him --- to literally &quot;cast your
burden,&quot; which He has given you, &quot;on the Lord . . . .&quot; If we set
out to serve God and do His work but get out of touch with Him, the sense of
responsibility we feel will be overwhelming and defeating. But if we will only
roll back on God the burdens He has placed on us, He will take away that
immense feeling of responsibility, replacing it with an awareness and
understanding of Himself and His presence.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Many
servants set out to serve God with great courage and with the right motives.
But with no intimate fellowship with Jesus Christ, they are soon defeated. They
do not know what to do with their burden, and it produces weariness in their
lives. Others will see this and say, &quot;What a sad end to something that had
such a great beginning!&quot;

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;Cast
your burden on the Lord . . . .&quot; You have been bearing it all, but you
need to deliberately place one end on God''s shoulder. &quot;. . . the
government will be upon His shoulder&quot; (Isa 9:6</span>).
Commit to God whatever burden He has placed on you. Don''t just cast it aside,
but put it over onto Him and place yourself there with it. You will see that
your burden is then lightened by the sense of companionship. But you should
never try to separate yourself from your burden.
