<b>The
Right Kind of Help

</b><span>(Joh 12:32)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Very
few of us have any understanding of the reason why Jesus Christ died. If
sympathy is all that human beings need, then the Cross of Christ is an
absurdity and there is absolutely no need for it. What the world needs is not
&quot;a little bit of love,&quot; but major surgery.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>When
you find yourself face to face with a person who is spiritually lost, remind
yourself of Jesus Christ on the cross. If that person can get to God in any
other way, then the Cross of Christ is unnecessary. If you think you are
helping lost people with your sympathy and understanding, you are a traitor to
Jesus Christ. You must have a right-standing relationship with Him yourself,
and pour your life out in helping others in His way --- not in a human way that
ignores God. The theme of the world''s religion today is to serve in a
pleasant, non-confrontational manner.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>But
our only priority must be to present Jesus Christ crucified --- to lift Him up
all the time (1Co 2:2</span>). Every belief
that is not firmly rooted in the Cross of Christ will lead people astray. If
the worker himself believes in Jesus Christ and is trusting in the reality of
redemption, his words will be compelling to others. What is extremely important
is for the worker''s simple relationship with Jesus Christ to be strong and growing.
His usefulness to God depends on that, and that alone.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
calling of a New Testament worker is to expose sin and to reveal Jesus Christ
as Savior. Consequently, he cannot always be charming and friendly, but must be
willing to be stern to accomplish major surgery. We are sent by God to lift up
Jesus Christ, not to give wonderfully beautiful speeches. We must be willing to
examine others as deeply as God has examined us. We must also be sharply intent
on sensing those Scripture passages that will drive the truth home, and then
not be afraid to apply them.
