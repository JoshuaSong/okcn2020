<b>&quot;Walk
in the Light&quot;

</b><span>(1Jo 1:7)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>To
mistake freedom from sin only on the conscious level of our lives for complete
deliverance from sin by the atonement through the Cross of Christ is a great
error. No one fully knows what sin is until he is born again. Sin is what Jesus
Christ faced at Calvary. The evidence that I have been delivered from sin is
that I know the real nature of sin in me. For a person to really know what sin
is requires the full work and deep touch of the atonement of Jesus Christ, that
is, the imparting of His absolute perfection.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
Holy Spirit applies or administers the work of the atonement to us in the deep
unconscious realm as well as in the conscious realm. And it is not until we
truly perceive the unrivaled power of the Spirit in us that we understand the
meaning of (1Jo 1:7</span>), which says,
&quot;. . . <i>the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all
sin.&quot;</i> This verse does not refer only to conscious sin, but also to the
tremendously profound understanding of sin which only the Holy Spirit in me can
accomplish.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>I
must &quot;walk in the light as He is in the light . . .&quot; --- not in the
light of my own conscience, but in God''s light. If I will walk there, with
nothing held back or hidden, then this amazing truth is revealed to me: &quot;.
. . the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses [me] from all sin&quot; so that
God Almighty can see nothing to rebuke in me. On the conscious level it
produces a keen, sorrowful knowledge of what sin really is. The love of God
working in me causes me to hate, with the Holy Spirit''s hatred for sin, anything
that is not in keeping with God''s holiness. To &quot;walk in the light&quot;
means that everything that is of the darkness actually drives me closer to the
center of the light.
