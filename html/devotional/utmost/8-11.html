<b>This
Experience Must Come

</b><span>(2Ki 2:11-12)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>It
is not wrong for you to depend on your &quot;Elijah&quot; for as long as God
gives him to you. But remember that the time will come when he must leave and
will no longer be your guide and your leader, because God does not intend for
him to stay. Even the thought of that causes you to say, &quot;I cannot
continue without my ''Elijah.'' &quot; Yet God says you must continue.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/><b>Alone
at Your &quot;Jordan&quot;</b>
(2Ki 2:14</span>). The Jordan River represents
the type of separation where you have no fellowship with anyone else, and where
no one else can take your responsibility from you. You now have to put to the
test what you learned when you were with your &quot;Elijah.&quot; You have been
to the Jordan over and over again with Elijah, but now you are facing it alone.
There is no use in saying that you cannot go --- the experience is here, and
you must go. If you truly want to know whether or not God is the God your faith
believes Him to be, then go through your &quot;Jordan&quot; alone.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/><b>Alone
at Your &quot;Jericho&quot;</b>
(2Ki 2:15</span>). Jericho represents the
place where you have seen your &quot;Elijah&quot; do great things. Yet when you
come alone to your &quot;Jericho,&quot; you have a strong reluctance to take
the initiative and trust in God, wanting, instead, for someone else to take it
for you. But if you remain true to what you learned while with your
&quot;Elijah,&quot; you will receive a sign, as Elisha did, that God is with
you.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/><b>Alone
at Your &quot;Bethel&quot;</b>
(2Ki 2:23</span>). At your &quot;Bethel&quot;
you will find yourself at your wits'' end but at the beginning of God''s
wisdom. When you come to your wits'' end and feel inclined to panic --- don''t!
Stand true to God and He will bring out His truth in a way that will make your
life an expression of worship. Put into practice what you learned while with
your &quot;Elijah&quot; --- use his mantle and pray (<span style='color:

not even look for Elijah anymore.
