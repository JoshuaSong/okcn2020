<b>The
Key of the Greater Work

</b><span>(Joh 14:12)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Prayer
does not equip us for greater works --- prayer is the greater work. Yet we
think of prayer as some commonsense exercise of our higher powers that simply
prepares us for God''s work. In the teachings of Jesus Christ, prayer is the
working of the miracle of redemption in me, which produces the miracle of
redemption in others, through the power of God. The way fruit remains firm is
through prayer, but remember that it is prayer based on the agony of Christ in
redemption, not on my own agony. We must go to God as His child, because only a
child gets his prayers answered; a &quot;wise&quot; man does not (<span
>Mat 11:25</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Prayer
is <i>the</i> battle, and it makes no difference where you are. However God may
engineer your circumstances, your duty is to pray. Never allow yourself this
thought, &quot;I am of no use where I am,&quot; because you certainly cannot be
used where you have not yet been placed. Wherever God has placed you and
whatever your circumstances, you should pray, continually offering up prayers
to Him. And He promises, &quot;Whatever you ask in My name, that I will do . .
.&quot; (Joh 14:13</span>). Yet we refuse to
pray unless it thrills or excites us, which is the most intense form of
spiritual selfishness. We must learn to work according to God''s direction, and
He says to <i>pray.</i> &quot;Pray the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers
into His harvest&quot; (Mat 9:38</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>There
is nothing thrilling about a laboring person''s work, but it is the laboring
person who makes the ideas of the genius possible. And it is the laboring saint
who makes the ideas of his Master possible. When you labor at prayer, from
God''s perspective there are always results. What an astonishment it will be to
see, once the veil is finally lifted, all the souls that have been reaped by
you, simply because you have been in the habit of taking your orders from Jesus
Christ.
