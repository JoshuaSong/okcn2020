<b>The
Key to the Missionary''s Work

</b><span>(Mat 28:18-19)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>The
key to the missionary''s work is the authority of Jesus Christ, not the needs
of the lost. We are inclined to look on our Lord as one who assists us in our
endeavors for God. Yet our Lord places Himself as the absolute sovereign and
supreme Lord over His disciples. He does not say that the lost will never be
saved if we don''t go --- He simply says, &quot;Go therefore and make disciples
of all the nations . . . .&quot; He says, &quot;Go on the basis of the revealed
truth of My sovereignty, teaching and preaching out of your living experience
of Me.&quot;

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;Then
the eleven disciples went . . . to the mountain which Jesus had appointed for
them&quot; (Mat 28:16</span>). If I want to
know the universal sovereignty of Christ, I must know Him myself. I must take
time to worship the One whose name I bear. Jesus says, &quot;Come to Me . .
.&quot; --- that is the place to meet Jesus --- &quot;all you who labor and are
heavy laden . . .&quot; (Mat 11:28</span>) ---
and how many missionaries are! We completely dismiss these wonderful words of
the universal Sovereign of the world, but they are the words of Jesus to His
disciples meant for here and now.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;Go
therefore . . . .&quot; To &quot;go&quot; simply means to live. (<span
>Act 1:8</span>) is the description of <i>how</i> to go.
Jesus did not say in this verse, &quot;<i>Go</i> into Jerusalem, Judea, and
Samaria,&quot; but, &quot;. . . you shall be <i>witnesses</i> to Me in [all
these places].&quot; He takes upon Himself the work of sending us.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;If
you abide in Me, and My words abide in you . . .&quot; (<span
>Joh 15:7</span>) --- that is the way to keep <i>going.</i>
Where we are placed is then a matter of indifference to us, because God
sovereignly engineers our <i>goings.</i>

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;None
of these things move me; nor do I count my life dear to myself, so that I may
finish my race with joy, and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus
. . .&quot; (Act 20:24</span>). That is how to
keep going until we are gone from this life.
