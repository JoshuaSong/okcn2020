<b>The
Supreme Climb

</b><span>(Gen 22:2)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>God''s
command is, &quot;Take <i>now,&quot;</i> not later. It is incredible how we
debate! We know something is right, but we try to find excuses for not doing it
immediately. If we are to climb to the height God reveals, it can never be done
later --- it must be done now. And the sacrifice must be worked through our
will before we actually perform it.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;So
Abraham rose early in the morning . . . and went to the place of which God had
told him&quot; (Gen 22:3</span>). Oh, the
wonderful simplicity of Abraham! When God spoke, he did not &quot;confer with
flesh and blood&quot; (Gal 1:16</span>).
Beware when you want to &quot;confer with flesh and blood&quot; or even your
own thoughts, insights, or understandings --- anything that is not based on
your personal relationship with God. These are all things that compete with and
hinder obedience to God.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Abraham
did not choose what the sacrifice would be. Always guard against self-chosen
service for God. Self-sacrifice may be a disease that impairs your service. If
God has made your cup sweet, drink it with grace; or even if He has made it
bitter, drink it in communion with Him. If the providential will of God means a
hard and difficult time for you, go through it. But never decide the place of
your own martyrdom, as if to say, &quot;I will only go to there, but no
farther.&quot; God chose the test for Abraham, and Abraham neither delayed nor
protested, but steadily obeyed. If you are not living in touch with God, it is
easy to blame Him or pass judgment on Him. You must go through the trial before
you have any right to pronounce a verdict, because by going through the trial
you learn to know God better. God is working in us to reach His highest goals
until His purpose and our purpose become one.
