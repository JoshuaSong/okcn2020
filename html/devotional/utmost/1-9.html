<b>The
Opened Sight

</b><span>(Act 26:17-18)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>&nbsp;This
verse is the greatest example of the true essence of the message of a disciple
of Jesus Christ in all of the New Testament.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>God''s
first sovereign work of grace is summed up in the words, &quot;. . . that they
may receive forgiveness of sins . . . .&quot; When a person fails in his
personal Christian life, it is usually because he has never <i>received</i>
anything. The only sign that a person is saved is that he has received
something from Jesus Christ. Our job as workers for God is to open people''s
eyes so that they may turn themselves from darkness to light. But that is not
salvation; it is conversion --- only the effort of an awakened human being. I
do not think it is too broad a statement to say that the majority of so-called
Christians are like this. Their eyes are open, but they have received nothing.
Conversion is not regeneration. This is a neglected fact in our preaching
today. When a person is born again, he knows that it is because he has received
something as a gift from Almighty God and not because of his own decision.
People may make vows and promises, and may be determined to follow through, but
none of this is salvation. Salvation means that we are brought to the place
where we are able to receive something from God on the authority of Jesus
Christ, namely, forgiveness of sins.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>This
is followed by God''s second mighty work of grace: &quot;. . . an inheritance
among those who are sanctified . . . .&quot; In sanctification, the one who has
been born again deliberately gives up his right to himself to Jesus Christ, and
identifies himself entirely with God''s ministry to others.
