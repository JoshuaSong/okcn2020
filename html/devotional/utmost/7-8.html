<b>Will
To Be Faithful

</b><span>(Jos 24:15)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>A
person''s will is embodied in the actions of the whole person. I cannot <i>give
up</i> my will --- I must exercise it, putting it into action. I must <i>will</i>
to obey, and I must <i>will</i> to receive God''s Spirit. When God gives me a
vision of truth, there is never a question of what He will do, but only of what
I will do. The Lord has been placing in front of each of us some big proposals
and plans. The best thing to do is to remember what you did before when you
were touched by God. Recall the moment when you were saved, or first recognized
Jesus, or realized some truth. It was easy then to yield your allegiance to
God. Immediately recall those moments each time the Spirit of God brings some
new proposal before you.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;.
. . choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve. . . .&quot; Your choice
must be a deliberate determination --- it is not something into which you will
automatically drift. And everything else in your life will be held in temporary
suspension until you make a decision. The proposal is between you and God ---
do not &quot;confer with flesh and blood&quot; about it (<span
>Gal 1:16</span>). With every new proposal, the people
around us seem to become more and more isolated, and that is where the tension
develops. God allows the opinion of His other saints to matter to you, and yet
you become less and less certain that others really understand the step you are
taking. You have no business trying to find out where God is leading --- the
only thing God will explain to you is Himself.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Openly
declare to Him, &quot;I will be faithful.&quot; But remember that as soon as
you choose to be faithful to Jesus Christ, &quot;You are witnesses against
yourselves . . .&quot; (Jos 24:22</span>).
Don''t consult with other Christians, but simply and freely declare before Him,
&quot;I will serve You.&quot; <i>Will</i> to be faithful --- and give other
people credit for being faithful too.
