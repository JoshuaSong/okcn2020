<b>The
Master Will Judge

</b><span>(2Co 5:10)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Paul
says that we must all, preachers and other people alike, &quot;appear before
the judgment seat of Christ.&quot; But if you will learn here and now to live
under the scrutiny of Christ''s pure light, your final judgment will bring you
only delight in seeing the work God has done in you. Live constantly reminding
yourself of the judgment seat of Christ, and walk in the knowledge of the
holiness He has given you. Tolerating a wrong attitude toward another person
causes you to follow the spirit of the devil, no matter how saintly you are.
One carnal judgment of another person only serves the purposes of hell in you.
Bring it immediately into the light and confess, &quot;Oh, Lord, I have been
guilty there.&quot; If you don''t, your heart will become hardened through and
through. One of the penalties of sin is our acceptance of it. It is not only
God who punishes for sin, but sin establishes itself in the sinner and takes
its toll. No struggling or praying will enable you to stop doing certain
things, and the penalty of sin is that you gradually get used to it, until you
finally come to the place where you no longer even realize that it is sin. No
power, except the power that comes from being filled with the Holy Spirit, can
change or prevent the inherent consequences of sin.

<br/>&quot;If
we walk in the light <i>as He is in the light</i> . . .&quot; (<span
>1Jo 1:7</span>). For many of us, walking in the light
means walking according to the standard we have set up for another person. The
deadliest attitude of the Pharisees that we exhibit today is not hypocrisy but
that which comes from unconsciously living a lie.
