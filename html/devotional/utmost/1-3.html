<b>Why
Can I Not Follow You Now?

</b><span>(Joh 13:37)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>&nbsp;There
are times when you can''t understand why you cannot do what you want to do.
When God brings a time of waiting, and appears to be unresponsive, don''t fill
it with busyness, just wait. The time of waiting may come to teach you the
meaning of sanctification --- to be set apart from sin and made holy --- or it
may come after the process of sanctification has begun to teach you what
service means. Never run before God gives you His direction. If you have the
slightest doubt, then He is not guiding. Whenever there is doubt --- wait.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>At
first you may see clearly what God''s will is --- the severance of a
friendship, the breaking off of a business relationship, or something else you
feel is distinctly God''s will for you to do. But never act on the impulse of
that feeling. If you do, you will cause difficult situations to arise which will
take years to untangle. Wait for God''s timing and He will do it without any
heartache or disappointment. When it is a question of the providential will of
God, wait for God to move.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Peter
did not wait for God. He predicted in his own mind where the test would come,
and it came where he did not expect it. &quot;I will lay down my life for Your
sake.&quot; Peter''s statement was honest but ignorant. &quot;Jesus answered
him, '' . . . the rooster shall not crow till you have denied Me three times'' &quot;
(Joh 13:38</span>). This was said with a
deeper knowledge of Peter than Peter had of himself. He could not follow Jesus
because he did not know himself or his own capabilities well enough. Natural
devotion may be enough to attract us to Jesus, to make us feel His irresistible
charm, but it will never make us disciples. Natural devotion will deny Jesus,
always falling short of what it means to truly follow Him.
