<b>&quot;Am
I My Brother&amp;#146;s Keeper?&quot;

</b><span>(Rom 14:7)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Has
it ever dawned on you that you are responsible spiritually to God for other
people? For instance, if I allow any turning away from God in my private life,
everyone around me suffers. We &quot;sit <i>together</i> in the heavenly places
. . .&quot; (Eph 2:6</span>). &quot;If one
member suffers, all the members suffer with it . . .&quot; (<span
>1Co 12:26</span>). If you allow physical selfishness,
mental carelessness, moral insensitivity, or spiritual weakness, everyone in
contact with you will suffer. But you ask, &quot;Who is sufficient to be able
to live up to such a lofty standard?&quot; &quot;Our sufficiency is from God .
. .&quot; and God alone (2Co 3:5</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;You
shall be witnesses to Me . . .&quot; (Act 1:8</span>).
How many of us are willing to spend every bit of our nervous, mental, moral,
and spiritual energy for Jesus Christ? That is what God means when He uses the
word <i>witness.</i> But it takes time, so be patient with yourself. Why has
God left us on the earth? Is it simply to be saved and sanctified? No, it is to
be at work in service to Him. Am I willing to be broken bread and poured-out
wine for Him? Am I willing to be of no value to this age or this life except
for one purpose and one alone --- to be used to disciple men and women to the
Lord Jesus Christ. My life of service to God is the way I say &quot;thank
you&quot; to Him for His inexpressibly wonderful salvation. Remember, it is
quite possible for God to set any of us aside if we refuse to be of service to
Him --- &quot;. . . lest, when I have preached to others, I myself should
become disqualified&quot; (1Co 9:27</span>).
