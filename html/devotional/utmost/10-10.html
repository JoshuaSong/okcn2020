<b>How
Will I Know?

</b><span>(Mat 11:25)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>We
do not grow into a spiritual relationship step by step --- we either have a
relationship or we do not. God does not continue to cleanse us more and more
from sin ---&quot;But if we walk in the light,&quot; we <i>are</i> cleansed
&quot;from all sin&quot; (1Jo 1:7</span>). It
is a matter of obedience, and once we obey, the relationship is instantly
perfected. But if we turn away from obedience for even one second, darkness and
death are immediately at work again.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>All
of God''s revealed truths are sealed until they are opened to us through
obedience. You will never open them through philosophy or thinking. But once
you obey, a flash of light comes immediately. Let God''s truth work into you by
immersing yourself in it, not by worrying into it. The only way you can get to
know the truth of God is to stop trying to find out and by being born again. If
you obey God in the first thing He shows you, then He instantly opens up the
next truth to you. You could read volumes on the work of the Holy Spirit, when
five minutes of total, uncompromising obedience would make things as clear as
sunlight. Don''t say, &quot;I suppose I will understand these things
someday!&quot; You can understand them now. And it is not study that brings
understanding to you, but obedience. Even the smallest bit of obedience opens
heaven, and the deepest truths of God immediately become yours. Yet God will
never reveal more truth about Himself to you, until you have obeyed what you
know already. Beware of becoming one of the &quot;wise and prudent.&quot;
&quot;If anyone wills to do His will, he shall know . . .&quot; (<span
>Joh 7:17</span>).
