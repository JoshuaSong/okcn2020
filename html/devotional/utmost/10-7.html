<b>The
Nature of Reconciliation

</b><span>(2Co 5:21)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Sin
is a fundamental relationship --- it is not wrong <i>doing,</i> but wrong <i>being</i>---
it is deliberate and determined independence from God. The Christian faith
bases everything on the extreme, self-confident nature of sin. Other faiths
deal with <i>sins</i>--- the Bible alone deals with <i>sin.</i> The first thing
Jesus Christ confronted in people was the heredity of sin, and it is because we
have ignored this in our presentation of the gospel that the message of the
gospel has lost its sting and its explosive power.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
revealed truth of the Bible is not that Jesus Christ took on Himself our
fleshly sins, but that He took on Himself the heredity of sin that no man can
even touch. God made His own Son &quot;to be sin&quot; that He might make the
sinner into a saint. It is revealed throughout the Bible that our Lord took on
Himself the sin of the world through <i>identification with us,</i> not through
<i>sympathy for us.</i> He deliberately took on His own shoulders, and endured
in His own body, the complete, cumulative sin of the human race. &quot;He made
Him who knew no sin to be <i>sin for us</i> . . .&quot; and by so doing He
placed salvation for the entire human race solely on the basis of redemption.
Jesus Christ reconciled the human race, putting it back to where God designed
it to be. And now anyone can experience that reconciliation, being brought into
oneness with God, on the basis of what our Lord has done on the cross.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>A
man cannot redeem himself --- redemption is the work of God, and is absolutely
finished and complete. And its application to individual people is a matter of
their own individual action or response to it. A distinction must always be
made between the revealed truth of redemption and the actual conscious
experience of salvation in a person''s life.
