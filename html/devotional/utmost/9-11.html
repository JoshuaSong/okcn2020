<br/><b>Ministering
in Everyday Opportunities.</b>
Ministering in everyday opportunities that surround us does not mean that we
select our own surroundings --- it means being God''s very special choice to be
available for use in any of the seemingly random surroundings which He has
engineered for us. The very character we exhibit in our present surroundings is
an indication of what we will be like in other surroundings.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
things Jesus did were the most menial of everyday tasks, and this is an
indication that it takes all of God''s power in me to accomplish even the most
common tasks in His way. Can I use a towel as He did? Towels, dishes, sandals,
and all the other ordinary things in our lives reveal what we are made of more
quickly than anything else. It takes God Almighty Incarnate in us to do the
most menial duty as it ought to be done.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Jesus
said, &quot;I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done to
you&quot; (Joh 13:15</span>). Notice the kind
of people that God brings around you, and you will be humiliated once you
realize that this is actually His way of revealing to you the kind of person
you have been to Him. Now He says we should exhibit to those around us exactly
what He has exhibited to us.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Do
you find yourself responding by saying, &quot;Oh, I will do all that once I''m
out on the mission field&quot;? Talking in this way is like trying to produce
the weapons of war while in the trenches of the battlefield --- you will be
killed while trying to do it.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>We
have to go the &quot;second mile&quot; with God (Mat 5:41</span>).
Yet some of us become worn out in the first ten steps. Then we say, &quot;Well,
I''ll just wait until I get closer to the next big crisis in my life.&quot; But
if we do not steadily minister in everyday opportunities, we will do nothing
when the crisis comes.
