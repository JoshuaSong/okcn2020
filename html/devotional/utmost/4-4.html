<b>The
Way to Permanent Faith

</b><span>(Joh 16:32)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Jesus
was not rebuking the disciples in this passage. Their faith was real, but it
was disordered and unfocused, and was not at work in the important realities of
life. The disciples were scattered to their own concerns and they had interests
apart from Jesus Christ. After we have the perfect relationship with God,
through the sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit, our faith must be exercised in
the realities of everyday life. We will be scattered, not into service but into
the emptiness of our lives where we will see ruin and barrenness, to know what
internal death to God''s blessings means. Are we prepared for this? It is
certainly not of our own choosing, but God engineers our circumstances to take
us there. Until we have been through that experience, our faith is sustained
only by feelings and by blessings. But once we get there, no matter where God
may place us or what inner emptiness we experience, we can praise God that all
is well. That is what is meant by faith being exercised in the realities of
life.

<br/>&quot;.
. . you . . . will leave Me alone.&quot; Have we been scattered and have we
left Jesus alone by not seeing His providential care for us? Do we not see God
at work in our circumstances? Dark times are allowed and come to us through the
sovereignty of God. Are we prepared to let God do what He wants with us? Are we
prepared to be separated from the outward, evident blessings of God? Until
Jesus Christ is truly our Lord, we each have goals of our own which we serve.
Our faith is real, but it is not yet permanent. And God is never in a hurry. If
we are willing to wait, we will see God pointing out that we have been
interested only in His blessings, instead of in God Himself. The sense of God''s
blessings is fundamental

. . be of good cheer, I have overcome the world&quot; (<span
>Joh 16:33</span>). Unyielding spiritual fortitude is
what we need.
