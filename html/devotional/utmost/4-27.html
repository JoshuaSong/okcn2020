<b>What
Do You Want?

</b><span>(Jer 45:5)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Are
you seeking great things for yourself, instead of seeking to be a great person?
God wants you to be in a much closer relationship with Himself than simply
receiving His gifts --- He wants you to get to know Him. Even some large thing
we want is only incidental; it comes and it goes. But God never gives us
anything incidental. There is nothing easier than getting into the right
relationship with God, unless it is not God you seek, but only what He can give
you.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>If
you have only come as far as asking God for things, you have never come to the
point of understanding the least bit of what surrender really means. You have
become a Christian based on your own terms. You protest, saying, &quot;I asked
God for the Holy Spirit, but He didn''t give me the rest and the peace I
expected.&quot; And instantly God puts His finger on the reason --- you are not
seeking the Lord at all; you are seeking something for yourself. Jesus said,
&quot;Ask, and it will be given to you . . .&quot; (Mat 7:7</span>).
Ask God for what you want and do not be concerned about asking for the wrong
thing, because as you draw ever closer to Him, you will cease asking for things
altogether. &quot;Your Father knows the things you have need of before you ask
Him&quot; (Mat 6:8</span>). Then why should
you ask? So that you may get to know Him.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Are
you seeking great things for yourself? Have you said, &quot;Oh, Lord,
completely fill me with your Holy Spirit&quot;? If God does not, it is because
you are not totally surrendered to Him; there is something you still refuse to
do. Are you prepared to ask yourself what it is you want from God and why you
want it? God always ignores your present level of completeness in favor of your
ultimate future completeness. He is not concerned about making you blessed and
happy right now, but He''s continually working out His ultimate perfection for
you --- &quot;. . . that they may be one just as We are one . . .&quot; (<span
>Joh 17:22</span>).
