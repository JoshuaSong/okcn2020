<b>Do
It Now!

</b><span>(Mat 5:25)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>In
this verse, Jesus Christ laid down a very important principle by saying,
&quot;Do what you know you must do --- <i>now.</i> Do it quickly. If you
don''t, an inevitable process will begin to work ''till you have paid the last
penny'' (Mat 5:26</span>) in pain, agony, and
distress.&quot; God''s laws are unchangeable and there is no escape from them.
The teachings of Jesus always penetrate right to the heart of our being.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Wanting
to make sure that my adversary gives me all my rights is a natural thing. But
Jesus says that it is a matter of inescapable and eternal importance to me that
I pay my adversary what I owe him. From our Lord''s standpoint it doesn''t
matter whether I am cheated or not, but what does matter is that I don''t cheat
someone else. Am I insisting on having my own rights, or am I paying what I owe
from Jesus Christ''s standpoint?

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Do
it quickly --- bring yourself to judgment now. In moral and spiritual matters,
you must act immediately. If you don''t, the inevitable, relentless process
will begin to work. God is determined to have His child as pure, clean, and
white as driven snow, and as long as there is disobedience in any point of His
teaching, He will allow His Spirit to use whatever process it may take to bring
us to obedience. The fact that we insist on proving that we are right is almost
always a clear indication that we have some point of disobedience. No wonder
the Spirit of God so strongly urges us to stay steadfastly in the light! (<span
>Joh 3:19-21</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;Agree
with your adversary quickly . . . .&quot; Have you suddenly reached a certain
place in your relationship with someone, only to find that you have anger in
your heart? Confess it quickly --- make it right before God. Be reconciled to
that person --- <i>do it now!</i>
