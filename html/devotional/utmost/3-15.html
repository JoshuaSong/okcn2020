<b>The
Discipline of Dismay

</b><span>(Mar 10:32)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>At
the beginning of our life with Jesus Christ, we were sure we knew all there was
to know about following Him. It was a delight to forsake everything else and to
throw ourselves before Him in a fearless statement of love. But now we are not
quite so sure. Jesus is far ahead of us and is beginning to seem different and
unfamiliar --- &quot;Jesus was going before them; and they were amazed&quot; (<span
>Mar 10:32</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>There
is an aspect of Jesus that chills even a disciple''s heart to its depth and
makes his entire spiritual life gasp for air. This unusual Person with His face
set &quot;like a flint&quot; (Isa 50:7</span>)
is walking with great determination ahead of me, and He strikes terror right
through me. He no longer seems to be my Counselor and Friend and has a point of
view about which I know nothing. All I can do is stand and stare at Him in
amazement. At first I was confident that I understood Him, but now I am not so
sure. I begin to realize that there is a distance between Jesus and me and I
can no longer be intimate with Him. I have no idea where He is going, and the
goal has become strangely distant.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Jesus
Christ had to understand fully every sin and sorrow that human beings could
experience, and that is what makes Him seem unfamiliar. When we see this aspect
of Him, we realize we really don''t know Him. We don''t recognize even one
characteristic of His life, and we don''t know how to begin to follow Him. He
is far ahead of us, a Leader who seems totally unfamiliar, and we have no
friendship with Him.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
discipline of dismay is an essential lesson which a disciple must learn. The
danger is that we tend to look back on our times of obedience and on our past
sacrifices to God in an effort to keep our enthusiasm for Him strong (<span
>Isa 50:10-11</span>). But when the darkness of dismay
comes, endure until it is over, because out of it will come the ability to
follow Jesus truly, which brings inexpressibly wonderful joy.
