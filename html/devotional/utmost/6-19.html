<br/>Jesus
did not say to make converts to your way of thinking, but He said to look after
His sheep, to see that they get nourished in the knowledge of Him. We consider
what we do in the way of Christian work as service, yet Jesus Christ calls
service to be what we <i>are</i> to Him, not what we <i>do</i> for Him.
Discipleship is based solely on devotion to Jesus Christ, not on following
after a particular belief or doctrine. &quot;If anyone comes to Me and does not
hate . . . , he cannot be My disciple&quot; (Luk 14:26</span>).
In this verse, there is no argument and no pressure from Jesus to follow Him;
He is simply saying, in effect, &quot;If you want to be My disciple, you must
be devoted solely to Me.&quot; A person touched by the Spirit of God suddenly
says, &quot;Now I see who Jesus is!&quot; --- that is the source of devotion.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Today
we have substituted doctrinal belief for personal belief, and that is why so
many people are devoted to causes and so few are devoted to Jesus Christ.
People do not really want to be devoted to Jesus, but only to the cause He
started. Jesus Christ is deeply offensive to the educated minds of today, to
those who only want Him to be their Friend, and who are unwilling to accept Him
in any other way. Our Lord''s primary obedience was to the will of His Father,
not to the needs of people --- the saving of people was the natural outcome of
His obedience to the Father. If I am devoted solely to the cause of humanity, I
will soon be exhausted and come to the point where my love will waver and
stumble. But if I love Jesus Christ personally and passionately, I can serve
humanity, even though people may treat me like a &quot;doormat.&quot; The
secret of a disciple''s life is devotion to Jesus Christ, and the
characteristic of that life is its seeming insignificance and its meekness. Yet
it is like a grain of wheat that &quot;falls into the ground and dies&quot; ---
it will spring up and change the entire landscape (Joh 12:24</span>).
