<b>Dependent
on God''s Presence

<br/>There
is no thrill for us in walking, yet it is the test for all of our steady and
enduring qualities. To &quot;walk and not faint&quot; is the highest stretch
possible as a measure of strength. The word <i>walk</i> is used in the Bible to
express the character of a person --- &quot;. . . John . . . looking at Jesus <i>as
He walked</i> . . . said, ''Behold the Lamb of God!'' &quot; (<span
>Joh 1:35-36</span>). There is nothing abstract or
obscure in the Bible; everything is vivid and real. God does not say, &quot;Be
spiritual,&quot; but He says, <i>&quot;Walk before Me</i> . . .&quot; (<span
>Gen 17:1</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>When
we are in an unhealthy condition either physically or emotionally, we always
look for thrills in life. In our physical life this leads to our efforts to
counterfeit the work of the Holy Spirit; in our emotional life it leads to
obsessions and to the destruction of our morality; and in our spiritual life,
if we insist on pursuing only thrills, on mounting up &quot;with wings like
eagles&quot; (Isa 40:31</span>), it will
result in the destruction of our spirituality.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Having
the reality of God''s presence is not dependent on our being in a particular
circumstance or place, but is only dependent on our determination to keep the
Lord before us continually. Our problems arise when we refuse to place our
trust in the reality of His presence. The experience the psalmist speaks of ---
&quot;We will not fear, even though . . .&quot; (Psa 46:2</span>)
--- will be ours once we are grounded on the truth of the reality of God''s
presence, not just a simple awareness of it, but an understanding of the
reality of it. Then we will exclaim, &quot;He has been here all the time!&quot;
At critical moments in our lives it is necessary to ask God for guidance, but
it should be unnecessary to be constantly saying, &quot;Oh, Lord, direct me in
this, and in that.&quot; Of course He will, and in fact, He is doing it
already! If our everyday decisions are not according to His will, He will press
through them, bringing restraint to our spirit. Then we must be quiet and wait
for the direction of His presence.
