<b>The
Cost of Sanctification

</b><span>(1Th 5:23)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>When
we pray, asking God to sanctify us, are we prepared to measure up to what that
really means? We take the word <i>sanctification</i> much too lightly. Are we
prepared to pay the cost of sanctification? The cost will be a deep restriction
of all our earthly concerns, and an extensive cultivation of all our godly
concerns. Sanctification means to be intensely focused on God''s point of view.
It means to secure and to keep all the strength of our body, soul, and spirit
for God''s purpose alone. Are we really prepared for God to perform in us
everything for which He separated us? And after He has done His work, are we
then prepared to separate ourselves to God just as Jesus did? &quot;For their
sakes I sanctify Myself . . .&quot; (Joh 17:19</span>).
The reason some of us have not entered into the experience of sanctification is
that we have not realized the meaning of sanctification from God''s
perspective. Sanctification means being made one with Jesus so that the nature
that controlled Him will control us. Are we really prepared for what that will
cost? It will cost absolutely everything in us which is not of God.

<br/>Are
we prepared to be caught up into the full meaning of Paul''s prayer in this
verse? Are we prepared to say, &quot;Lord, make me, a sinner saved by grace, as
holy as You can&quot;? Jesus prayed that we might be one with Him, just as He
is one with the Father (Joh 17:21-23</span>).
The resounding evidence of the Holy Spirit in a person''s life is the
unmistakable family likeness to Jesus Christ, and the freedom from everything
which is not like Him. Are we prepared to set ourselves apart for the Holy
Spirit''s work in us?
