<b>The
Teaching of Adversity

</b><span>(Joh 16:33)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>The
typical view of the Christian life is that it means being delivered from all
adversity. But it actually means being delivered <i>in</i> adversity, which is
something very different. &quot;He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High
shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. No evil shall befall you, nor
shall any plague come near your dwelling . . .&quot; (<span
>Psa 91:1, Psa 91:10</span>) --- the place where you are
at one with God.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>If
you are a child of God, you will certainly encounter adversities, but Jesus
says you should not be surprised when they come. &quot;In the world you will
have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.&quot; He is
saying, &quot;There is nothing for you to fear.&quot; The same people who refused
to talk about their adversities before they were saved often complain and worry
after being born again because they have the wrong idea of what it means to
live the life of a saint.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>God
does not give us overcoming life --- He gives us life as we overcome. The
strain of life is what builds our strength. If there is no strain, there will
be no strength. Are you asking God to give you life, liberty, and joy? He
cannot, unless you are willing to accept the strain. And once you face the
strain, you will immediately get the strength. Overcome your own timidity and
take the first step. Then God will give you nourishment --- &quot;To him who
overcomes I will give to eat from the tree of life . . .&quot;( <span
>Rev 2:7</span>). If you completely give of yourself
physically, you become exhausted. But when you give of yourself spiritually,
you get more strength. God never gives us strength for tomorrow, or for the
next hour, but only for the strain of the moment. Our temptation is to face
adversities from the standpoint of our own common sense. But a saint can
&quot;be of good cheer&quot; even when seemingly defeated by adversities,
because victory is absurdly impossible to everyone, except God.
