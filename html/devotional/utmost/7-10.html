<b>The
Spiritually Lazy Saint

</b><span>(Heb 10:24-25)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>We
are all capable of being spiritually lazy saints. We want to stay off the rough
roads of life, and our primary objective is to secure a peaceful retreat from
the world. The ideas put forth in these verses from Hebrews 10 are those of
stirring up one another and of keeping ourselves together. Both of these
require initiative --- our willingness to take the first step toward
Christ-realization, not the initiative toward self-realization. To live a
distant, withdrawn, and secluded life is diametrically opposed to spirituality
as Jesus Christ taught it.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
true test of our spirituality occurs when we come up against injustice,
degradation, ingratitude, and turmoil, all of which have the tendency to make
us spiritually lazy. While being tested, we want to use prayer and Bible
reading for the purpose of finding a quiet retreat. We use God only for the
sake of getting peace and joy. We seek only our enjoyment of Jesus Christ, not
a true realization of Him. This is the first step in the wrong direction. All
these things we are seeking are simply effects, and yet we try to make them
causes.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;Yes,
I think it is right,&quot; Peter said, &quot;. . . to stir you up by reminding
you . . .&quot; (2Pe 1:13</span>). It is a
most disturbing thing to be hit squarely in the stomach by someone being used
of God to stir us up --- someone who is full of spiritual activity. Simple
active work and spiritual activity are not the same thing. Active work can
actually be the counterfeit of spiritual activity. The real danger in spiritual
laziness is that we do not want to be stirred up --- all we want to hear about
is a spiritual retirement from the world. Yet Jesus Christ never encourages the
idea of retirement --- He says, &quot;Go and tell My brethren . . .&quot; (<span
>Mat 28:10</span>).
