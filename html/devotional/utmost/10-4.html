<b>The
Vision and The Reality

</b><span>(1Co 1:2)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Thank
God for being able to see all that you have not yet been. You have had the
vision, but you are not yet to the reality of it by any means. It is when we
are in the valley, where we prove whether we will be the choice ones, that most
of us turn back. We are not quite prepared for the bumps and bruises that must
come if we are going to be turned into the shape of the vision. We have seen
what we are not, and what God wants us to be, but are we willing to be battered
into the shape of the vision to be used by God? The beatings will always come
in the most common, everyday ways and through common, everyday people.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>There
are times when we do know what God''s purpose is; whether we will let the
vision be turned into actual character depends on us, not on God. If we prefer
to relax on the mountaintop and live in the memory of the vision, then we will
be of no real use in the ordinary things of which human life is made. We have
to learn to live in reliance upon what we saw in the vision, not simply live in
ecstatic delight and conscious reflection upon God. This means living the
realities of our lives in the light of the vision until the truth of the vision
is actually realized in us. Every bit of our training is in that direction.
Learn to thank God for making His demands known.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Our
little &quot;I am&quot; always sulks and pouts when God says <i>do.</i> Let
your little &quot;I am&quot; be shriveled up in God''s wrath and indignation
---&quot;I AM WHO I AM . . . has sent me to you&quot; (<span
>Exo 3:14</span>). He must dominate. Isn''t it piercing
to realize that God not only knows where we live, but also knows the gutters
into which we crawl! He will hunt us down as fast as a flash of lightning. No
human being knows human beings as God does.
