<b>Getting
There

</b><span>(Joh 1:38-39)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/><b>Where
our self-interest sleeps and the real interest is awakened.</b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Trebuchet MS","sans-serif"'> &quot;They . . .
remained with Him that day . . . .&quot; That is about all some of us ever do.
We stay with Him a short time, only to wake up to our own realities of life.
Our self-interest rises up and our abiding with Him is past. Yet there is no
circumstance of life in which we cannot abide in Jesus.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;You
are Simon . . . . You shall be called Cephas&quot; (Joh 1:42</span>).
God writes our new name only on those places in our lives where He has erased
our pride, self-sufficiency, and self-interest. Some of us have our new name
written only in certain spots, like spiritual measles. And in those areas of
our lives we look all right. When we are in our best spiritual mood, you would
think we were the highest quality saints. But don''t dare look at us when we
are not in that mood. A true disciple is one who has his new name written all
over him --- self-interest, pride, and self-sufficiency have been completely
erased.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Pride
is the sin of making &quot;self&quot; our god. And some of us today do this,
not like the Pharisee, but like the tax collector (Luk 18:9-14</span>).
For you to say, &quot;Oh, I''m no saint,&quot; is acceptable by human standards
of pride, but it is unconscious blasphemy against God. You defy God to make you
a saint, as if to say, &quot;I am too weak and hopeless and outside the reach
of the atonement by the Cross of Christ.&quot; Why aren''t you a saint? It is
either that you do not want to be a saint, or that you do not believe that God
can make you into one. You say it would be all right if God saved you and took
you straight to heaven. That is exactly what He will do! And not only do we
make our home with Him, but Jesus said of His Father and Himself, &quot;. . .
We will come to him and make Our home with him&quot; (<span
>Joh 14:23</span>). Put no conditions on your life ---
let Jesus be everything to you, and He will take you home with Him not only for
a day, but for eternity.
