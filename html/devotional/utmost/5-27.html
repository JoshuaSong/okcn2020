<b>The
Life To Know Him

</b><span>(Luk 24:49)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>The
disciples had to tarry, staying in Jerusalem until the day of Pentecost, not
only for their own preparation but because they had to wait until the Lord was
actually glorified. And as soon as He was glorified, what happened?
&quot;Therefore being exalted to the right hand of God, and having received
from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, He poured out this which you
now see and hear&quot; (Act 2:33</span>). The
statement in John 7:39 (Joh 7:39</span>) ---
&quot;. . . for the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet
glorified&quot; --- does not pertain to us. The Holy Spirit <i>has been</i>
given; the Lord <i>is</i> glorified --- our waiting is not dependent on the
providence of God, but on our own spiritual fitness.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
Holy Spirit''s influence and power were at work before Pentecost, but <i>He</i>
was not here. Once our Lord was glorified in His ascension, the Holy Spirit
came into the world, and He has been here ever since. We have to receive the
revealed truth that He is here. The attitude of receiving and welcoming the
Holy Spirit into our lives is to be the continual attitude of a believer. When
we receive the Holy Spirit, we receive reviving life from our ascended Lord.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>It
is not the baptism of the Holy Spirit that changes people, but the power of the
ascended Christ coming into their lives through the Holy Spirit. We all too
often separate things that the New Testament never separates. The baptism of
the Holy Spirit is not an experience apart from Jesus Christ --- it is the
evidence of the ascended Christ.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
baptism of the Holy Spirit does not make you think of time or eternity --- it
is one amazing glorious <i>now.</i> &quot;This is eternal life, that they may
know You . . .&quot; (Joh 17:3</span>). Begin
to know Him now, and never finish.
