<b>Visions
Become Reality

</b><span>(Isa 35:7)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>We
always have a vision of something before it actually becomes real to us. When
we realize that the vision is real, but is not yet real in us, Satan comes to
us with his temptations, and we are inclined to say that there is no point in
even trying to continue. Instead of the vision becoming real to us, we have
entered into a valley of humiliation.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Life
is not as idle ore,

<br/>But
iron dug from central gloom,

<br/>And
battered by the shocks of doom shape and use.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>God
gives us a vision, and then He takes us down to the valley to batter us into
the shape of that vision. It is in the valley that so many of us give up and
faint. Every God-given vision will become real if we will only have patience.
Just think of the enormous amount of free time God has! He is never in a hurry.
Yet we are always in such a frantic hurry. While still in the light of the
glory of the vision, we go right out to do things, but the vision is not yet
real in us. God has to take us into the valley and put us through fires and
floods to batter us into shape, until we get to the point where He can trust us
with the reality of the vision. Ever since God gave us the vision, He has been
at work. He is getting us into the shape of the goal He has for us, and yet
over and over again we try to escape from the Sculptor''s hand in an effort to
batter ourselves into the shape of our own goal.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
vision that God gives is not some unattainable castle in the sky, but a vision
of what God wants you to be down here. Allow the Potter to put you on His wheel
and whirl you around as He desires. Then as surely as God is God, and you are
you, you will turn out as an exact likeness of the vision. But don''t lose
heart in the process. If you have ever had a vision from God, you may try as
you will to be satisfied on a lower level, but God will never allow it.
