<b>What
My Obedience to God Costs Other People

</b><span>(Luk 23:26)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>&nbsp;If
we obey God, it is going to cost other people more than it costs us, and that
is where the pain begins. If we are in love with our Lord, obedience does not
cost us anything --- it is a delight. But to those who do not love Him, our
obedience does cost a great deal. If we obey God, it will mean that other
people''s plans are upset. They will ridicule us as if to say, &quot;You call
this Christianity?&quot; We could prevent the suffering, but not if we are
obedient to God. We must let the cost be paid.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>When
our obedience begins to cost others, our human pride entrenches itself and we
say, &quot;I will never accept anything from anyone.&quot; But we must, or
disobey God. We have no right to think that the type of relationships we have
with others should be any different from those the Lord Himself had (<span
>Luk 8:1-3</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>A
lack of progress in our spiritual life results when we try to bear all the
costs ourselves. And actually, we cannot. Because we are so involved in the
universal purposes of God, others are immediately affected by our obedience to
Him. Will we remain faithful in our obedience to God and be willing to suffer
the humiliation of refusing to be independent? Or will we do just the opposite
and say, &quot;I will not cause other people to suffer&quot;? We can disobey
God if we choose, and it will bring immediate relief to the situation, but it
will grieve our Lord. If, however, we obey God, He will care for those who have
suffered the consequences of our obedience. We must simply obey and leave all
the consequences with Him.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Beware
of the inclination to dictate to God what consequences you would allow as a
condition of your obedience to Him.
