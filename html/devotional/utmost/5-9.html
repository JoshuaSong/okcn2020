<b>Reaching
Beyond Our Grasp

</b><span>(Pro 29:18)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>There
is a difference between holding on to a principle and having a vision. A principle
does not come from moral inspiration, but a vision does. People who are totally
consumed with idealistic principles rarely <i>do</i> anything. A person''s own
idea of God and His attributes may actually be used to justify and rationalize
his deliberate neglect of his duty. Jonah tried to excuse his disobedience by
saying to God, &quot;. . . I know that You are a gracious and merciful God,
slow to anger and abundant in lovingkindness, One who relents from doing
harm&quot; Jon 4:2</span>. I too may have the
right idea of God and His attributes, but that may be the very reason why I do
not do my duty. But wherever there is vision, there is also a life of honesty
and integrity, because the vision gives me the moral incentive.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Our
own idealistic principles may actually lull us into ruin. Examine yourself
spiritually to see if you have vision, or only principles.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Ah,
but a man''s reach should exceed his grasp, Or what''s a heaven for?

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;Where
there is no revelation [or prophetic vision]. . . .&quot; Once we lose sight of
God, we begin to be reckless. We cast off certain restraints from activities we
know are wrong. We set prayer aside as well and cease having God''s vision in
the little things of life. We simply begin to act on our own initiative. If we
are eating only out of our own hand, and doing things solely on our own
initiative without expecting God to come in, we are on a downward path. We have
lost the vision. Is our attitude today an attitude that flows from our vision
of God? Are we expecting God to do greater things than He has ever done before?
Is there a freshness and a vitality in our spiritual outlook?
