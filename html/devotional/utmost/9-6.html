<b>The
Far-Reaching Rivers of Life

</b><span>(Joh 7:38)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>A
river reaches places which its source never knows. And Jesus said that, if we
have received His fullness, &quot;rivers of living water&quot; will flow out of
us, reaching in blessing even &quot;to the end of the earth&quot; (<span
>Act 1:8</span>) regardless of how small the visible
effects of our lives may appear to be. We have nothing to do with the outflow
---&nbsp; &quot;This is the work of God, that you <i>believe</i> . . .&quot; (<span
>Joh 6:29</span>). God rarely allows a person to see how
great a blessing he is to others.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>A
river is victoriously persistent, overcoming all barriers. For a while it goes
steadily on its course, but then comes to an obstacle. And for a while it is
blocked, yet it soon makes a pathway around the obstacle. Or a river will drop
out of sight for miles, only later to emerge again even broader and greater
than ever. Do you see God using the lives of others, but an obstacle has come
into your life and you do not seem to be of any use to God? Then keep paying
attention to the Source, and God will either take you around the obstacle or
remove it. The river of the Spirit of God overcomes all obstacles. Never focus
your eyes on the obstacle or the difficulty. The obstacle will be a matter of
total indifference to the river that will flow steadily through you if you will
simply remember to stay focused on the Source. Never allow anything to come
between you and Jesus Christ --- not emotion nor experience --- nothing must
keep you from the one great sovereign Source.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Think
of the healing and far-reaching rivers developing and nourishing themselves in
our souls! God has been opening up wonderful truths to our minds, and every
point He has opened up is another indication of the wider power of the river
that He will flow through us. If you believe in Jesus, you will find that God
has developed and nourished in you mighty, rushing rivers of blessing for
others.
