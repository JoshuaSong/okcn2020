<b>The
Dilemma of Obedience

</b><span>(1Sa 3:15)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>God
never speaks to us in dramatic ways, but in ways that are easy to
misunderstand. Then we say, &quot;I wonder if that is God''s voice?&quot;
Isaiah said that the Lord spoke to him &quot;with a strong hand,&quot; that is,
by the pressure of his circumstances (Isa 8:11</span>).
Without the sovereign hand of God Himself, nothing touches our lives. Do we
discern His hand at work, or do we see things as mere occurrences?

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Get
into the habit of saying, &quot;Speak, Lord,&quot; and life will become a
romance (1Sa 3:9</span>). Every time
circumstances press in on you, say, &quot;Speak, Lord,&quot; and make time to
listen. Chastening is more than a means of discipline --- it is meant to bring
me to the point of saying, &quot;Speak, Lord.&quot; Think back to a time when
God spoke to you. Do you remember what He said? Was it (<span
>Luk 11:13</span>), or was it (<span
>1Th 5:23</span>)? As we listen, our ears become more
sensitive, and like Jesus, we will hear God all the time.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Should
I tell my &quot;Eli&quot; what God has shown to me? This is where the dilemma
of obedience hits us. We disobey God by becoming amateur providences and
thinking, &quot;I must shield ''Eli,'' &quot; who represents the best people we
know. God did not tell Samuel to tell Eli --- he had to decide that for
himself. God''s message to you may hurt your &quot;Eli,&quot; buttrying to
prevent suffering in another''s life will prove to be an obstruction between
your soul and God. It is at your own risk that you prevent someone''s right
hand being cut off or right eye being plucked out (Mat 5:29-30</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Never
ask another person''s advice about anything God makes you decide before Him. If
you ask advice, you will almost always side with Satan. &quot;. . . I did not
immediately confer with flesh and blood . . .&quot; (<span style='color:
