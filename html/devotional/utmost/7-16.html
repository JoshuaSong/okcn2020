<b>The
Concept of Divine Control

</b><span>(Mat 7:11)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Jesus
is laying down the rules of conduct in this passage for those people who have
His Spirit. He urges us to keep our minds filled with the concept of God''s
control over everything, which means that a disciple must maintain an attitude
of perfect trust and an eagerness to ask and to seek.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Fill
your mind with the thought that God is there. And once your mind is truly filled
with that thought, when you experience difficulties it will be as easy as
breathing for you to remember, &quot;My heavenly Father knows all about
this!&quot; This will be no effort at all, but will be a natural thing for you
when difficulties and uncertainties arise. Before you formed this concept of
divine control so powerfully in your mind, you used to go from person to person
seeking help, but now you go to God about it. Jesus is laying down the rules of
conduct for those people who have His Spirit, and it works on the following
principle: God is my Father, He loves me, and I will never think of anything
that He will forget, so why should I worry?

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Jesus
said there are times when God cannot lift the darkness from you, but you should
trust Him. At times God will appear like an unkind friend, but He is not; He
will appear like an unnatural father, but He is not; He will appear like an
unjust judge, but He is not. Keep the thought that the mind of God is behind
all things strong and growing. Not even the smallest detail of life happens
unless God''s will is behind it. Therefore, you can rest in perfect confidence
in Him. Prayer is not only asking, but is an attitude of the mind which
produces the atmosphere in which asking is perfectly natural. &quot;Ask, and it
will be given to you . . .&quot; (Mat 7:7</span>).
