<b>The
Never-forsaking God

</b><span>(Heb 13:5)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>What
line of thinking do my thoughts take? Do I turn to what God says or to my own
fears? Am I simply repeating what God says, or am I learning to truly hear Him
and then to respond after I have heard what He says? &quot;For He Himself has
said, ''I will never leave you nor forsake you.'' So we may boldly say: ''The
Lord is my helper; I will not fear. What can man do to me?'' &quot; (<span
>Heb 13:5-6</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;I
will never leave you . . .&quot; --- not for any reason; not my sin,
selfishness, stubbornness, nor waywardness. Have I really let God say to me
that He will never leave me? If I have not truly heard this assurance of God,
then let me listen again.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;I
will never . . . forsake you.&quot; Sometimes it is not the difficulty of life
but the drudgery of it that makes me think God will forsake me. When there is
no major difficulty to overcome, no vision from God, nothing wonderful or
beautiful --- just the everyday activities of life --- do I hear God''s
assurance even in these?

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>We
have the idea that God is going to do some exceptional thingthat He is
preparing and equipping us for some extraordinary work in the future. But as we
grow in His grace we find that God is glorifying Himself here and now, at this
very moment. If we have God''s assurance behind us, the most amazing strength
becomes ours, and we learn to sing, glorifying Him even in the ordinary days
and ways of life.
