<b>The
Key to the Missionary''s Devotion

</b><span>(3Jo 1:7)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Our
Lord told us how our love for Him is to exhibit itself when He asked, &quot;Do
you love Me?&quot; (Joh 21:17</span>). And
then He said, &quot;Feed My sheep.&quot; In effect, He said, &quot;Identify <i>yourself</i>
with <i>My</i> interests in other people,&quot; not, &quot;Identify <i>Me</i>
with <i>your</i> interests in other people.&quot; (1Co 13:4-8</span>)
shows us the characteristics of this love --- it is actually the love <i>of God</i>
expressing itself. The true test of my love for Jesus is a very practical one,
and all the rest is sentimental talk.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Faithfulness
to Jesus Christ is the supernatural work of redemption that has been performed
in me by the Holy Spirit ---&quot;the love of God has been poured out in our
hearts by the Holy Spirit . . .&quot; (Rom 5:5</span>).
And it is that love in me that effectively works through me and comes in
contact with everyone I meet. I remain faithful to His name, even though the
commonsense view of my life may seemingly deny that, and may appear to be
declaring that He has no more power than the morning mist.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
key to the missionary''s devotion is that he is attached to nothing and to no
one except our Lord Himself. It does not mean simply being detached from the
external things surrounding us. Our Lord was amazingly in touch with the
ordinary things of life, but He had an inner detachment except toward God.
External detachment is often an actual indication of a secret, growing, inner
attachment to the things we stay away from externally.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
duty of a faithful missionary is to concentrate on keeping his soul completely
and continually open to the nature of the Lord Jesus Christ. The men and women
our Lord sends out on His endeavors are ordinary human people, but people who
are controlled by their devotion to Him, which has been brought about through
the work of the Holy Spirit.
