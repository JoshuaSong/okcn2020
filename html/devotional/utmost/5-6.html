<b>Liberty
and the Standards of Jesus

</b><span>(Gal 5:1)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>A
spiritually-minded person will never come to you with the demand&quot;Believe
this and that&quot;; a spiritually-minded person will demand that you align
your life with the standards of Jesus. We are not asked to believe the Bible,
but to believe the One whom the Bible reveals Joh 5:39-40</span>.
We are called to present liberty for the conscience of others, not to bring
them liberty for their thoughts and opinions. And if we ourselves are free with
the liberty of Christ, others will be brought into that same libertythe liberty
that comes from realizing the absolute control and authority of Jesus Christ.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Always
measure your life solely by the standards of Jesus. Submit yourself to His
yoke, and His alone; and always be careful never to place a yoke on others that
is not of Jesus Christ. It takes God a long time to get us to stop thinking
that unless everyone sees things exactly as we do, they must be wrong. That is
never God''s view. There is only one true libertythe liberty of Jesus at work
in our conscience enabling us to do what is right.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Don''t
get impatient with others. Remember how God dealt with youwith patience and
with gentleness. But never water down the truth of God. Let it have its way and
never apologize for it. Jesus said, &quot;Go . . . and make <i>disciples</i> .
. .&quot; Mat 28:19</span>, not, &quot;Make
converts to your own thoughts and opinions.&quot;
