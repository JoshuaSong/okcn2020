<b>The
Discipline of Spiritual Perseverance

</b><span>(Psa 46:10)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Perseverance
is more than endurance. It is endurance combined with absolute assurance and
certainty that what we are looking for is going to happen. Perseverance means
more than just hanging on, which may be only exposing our fear of letting go
and falling. Perseverance is our supreme effort of refusing to believe that our
hero is going to be conquered. Our greatest fear is not that we will be damned,
but that somehow Jesus Christ will be defeated. Also, our fear is that the very
things our Lord stood for --- love, justice, forgiveness, and kindness among
men --- will not win out in the end and will represent an unattainable goal for
us. Then there is the call to spiritual perseverance. A call not to hang on and
do nothing, but to work deliberately, knowing with certainty that God will
never be defeated.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>If
our hopes seem to be experiencing disappointment right now, it simply means
that they are being purified. Every hope or dream of the human mind will be
fulfilled if it is noble and of God. But one of the greatest stresses in life
is the stress of waiting for God. He brings fulfillment, &quot;because you have
kept My command to persevere . . .&quot; (Rev 3:10</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Continue
to persevere spiritually.
