<b>Obedience
or Independence?

</b><span>(Joh 14:15)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Our
Lord never insists on our obedience. He stresses very definitely what we <i>ought</i>
to do, but He never <i>forces</i> us to do it. We have to obey Him out of a
oneness of spirit with Him. That is why whenever our Lord talked about
discipleship, He prefaced it with an &quot;If,&quot; meaning, &quot;You do not
need to do this unless you desire to do so.&quot; <i>&quot;If</i> anyone
desires to come after Me, let him deny himself . . .&quot; (<span
>Luk 9:23</span>). In other words, &quot;To be My
disciple, let him give up his right to himself to Me.&quot; Our Lord is not
talking about our eternal position, but about our being of value to Him in this
life here and now. That is why He sounds so stern (Luk 14:26</span>).
Never try to make sense from these words by separating them from the One who
spoke them.

<br/>The
Lord does not give me rules, but He makes His standard very clear. If my
relationship to Him is that of love, I will do what He says without hesitation.
If I hesitate, it is because I love someone I have placed in competition with
Him, namely, myself. Jesus Christ will not force me to obey Him, but I must.
And as soon as I obey Him, I fulfill my spiritual destiny. My personal life may
be crowded with small, petty happenings, altogether insignificant. But if I
obey Jesus Christ in the seemingly random circumstances of life, they become
pinholes through which I see the face of God. Then, when I stand face to face
with God, I will discover that through my obedience thousands were blessed.
When God''s redemption brings a human soul to the point of obedience, it always
produces. If I obey Jesus Christ, the redemption of God will flow through me to
the lives of others, because behind the deed of obedience is the reality of
Almighty God.
