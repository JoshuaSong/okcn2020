<b>Getting
into God''s Stride

</b><span>(Gen 5:24)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>The
true test of a person''s spiritual life and character is not what he does in
the extraordinary moments of life, but what he does during the ordinary times
when there is nothing tremendous or exciting happening. A person''s worth is
revealed in his attitude toward the ordinary things of life when he is not
under the spotlight (Joh 1:35-37, Joh 3:30</span>).
It is painful work to get in step with God and to keep pace with Him --- it
means getting your second wind spiritually. In learning to walk with God, there
is always the difficulty of getting into His stride, but once we have done so,
the only characteristic that exhibits itself is the very life of God Himself.
The individual person is merged into a personal oneness with God, and God''s
stride and His power alone are exhibited.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>It
is difficult to get into stride with God, because as soon as we start walking
with Him we find that His pace has surpassed us before we have even taken three
steps. He has different ways of doing things, and we have to be trained and
disciplined in His ways. It was said of Jesus ---&quot;He will not fail nor be
discouraged . . .&quot; (Isa 42:4</span>)
because He never worked from His own individual standpoint, but always worked
from the standpoint of His Father. And we must learn to do the same. Spiritual
truth is learned through the atmosphere that surrounds us, not through
intellectual reasoning. It is God''s Spirit that changes the atmosphere of our
way of looking at things, and then things begin to be possible which before
were impossible. Getting into God''s stride means nothing less than oneness
with Him. It takes a long time to get there, but keep at it. Don''t give up
because the pain is intense right now --- get on with it, and before long you
will find that you have a new vision and a new purpose.
