<b>What
You Will Get

</b><span>(Jer 45:5)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>This
is the firm and immovable secret of the Lord to those who trust Him --- &quot;I
will give your life to you . . . .&quot; What more does a man want than his
life? It is the essential thing. &quot;. . . your life . . . as a prize . .
.&quot; means that wherever you may go, even if it is into hell, you will come
out with your life and nothing can harm it. So many of us are caught up in
exhibiting things for others to see, not showing off property and possessions,
but our blessings. All these things that we so proudly show have to go. But
there is something greater that can never go --- the life that &quot;is hidden
with Christ in God&quot; (Col 3:3</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Are
you prepared to let God take you into total oneness with Himself, paying no
more attention to what you call the great things of life? Are you prepared to
surrender totally and let go? The true test of abandonment or surrender is in
refusing to say, &quot;Well, what about this?&quot; Beware of your own ideas
and speculations. The moment you allow yourself to think, &quot;What about
this?&quot; you show that you have not surrendered and that you do not really
trust God. But once you do surrender, you will no longer think about what God
is going to do. Abandonment means to refuse yourself the luxury of asking any
questions. If you totally abandon yourself to God, He immediately says to you,
&quot;I will give your life to you as a prize . . . .&quot; The reason people
are tired of life is that God has not given them anything --- they have not
been given their life &quot;as a prize.&quot; The way to get out of that
condition is to abandon yourself to God. And once you do get to the point of
total surrender to Him, you will be the most surprised and delighted person on
earth. God will have you absolutely, without any limitations, and He will have
given you your life. If you are not there, it is either because of disobedience
in your life or your refusal to be simple enough.
