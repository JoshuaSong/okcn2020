<b>How
Could Someone So Persecute Jesus!

</b><span>(Act 26:14)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Are
you determined to have your own way in living for God? We will never be free
from this trap until we are brought into the experience of the&nbsp;&nbsp;
baptism of &quot;the Holy Spirit and fire&quot; (Mat 3:11</span>).
Stubbornness and self-will will always stab Jesus Christ. It may hurt no one
else, but it wounds&nbsp;&nbsp; His Spirit. Whenever we are obstinate and
self-willed and set on our own ambitions, we are hurting Jesus. Every time we
stand on our own rights and&nbsp;&nbsp; insist that this is what we intend to
do, we are persecuting Him. Whenever we rely on self-respect, we systematically
disturb and grieve His Spirit. And&nbsp;&nbsp; when we finally understand that
it is Jesus we have been persecuting all this time, it is the most crushing
revelation ever.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Is
the Word of God tremendously penetrating and sharp in me as I hand it on to
you, or does my life betray the things I profess to teach? I may
teach&nbsp;&nbsp; sanctification and yet exhibit the spirit of Satan, the very
spirit that persecutes Jesus Christ. The Spirit of Jesus is conscious of only
one thing --- a perfect oneness with the Father. And He tells us, &quot;Take My
yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you
will find&nbsp;&nbsp; rest for your souls&quot; (Mat 11:29</span>).
All I do should be based on a perfect oneness with Him, not on a self-willed
determination to be godly. This&nbsp;&nbsp; will mean that others may use me,
go around me, or completely ignore me, but if I will submit to it for His sake,
I will prevent Jesus Christ from being&nbsp;&nbsp; persecuted.
