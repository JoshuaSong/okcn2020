<b>&quot;Work
Out&quot; What God &quot;Works in&quot; You

</b><span>(Phi 2:12-13)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Your
will agrees with God, but in your flesh there is a nature that renders you
powerless to do what you know you ought to do. When the Lord initially comes in
contact with our conscience, the first thing our conscience does is awaken our
will, and our will always agrees with God. Yet you say, &quot;But I don''t know
if my will is in agreement with God.&quot; Look to Jesus and you will find that
your will and your conscience are in agreement with Him every time. What causes
you to say &quot;I will not obey&quot; is something less deep and penetrating
than your will. It is perversity or stubbornness, and they are never in
agreement with God. The most profound thing in a person is his will, not sin.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
will is the essential element in God''s creation of human beings --- sin is a
perverse nature which entered into people. In someone who has been born again,
the source of the will is Almighty God. &quot;. . . for it is God who works in
you both to will and to do for His good pleasure.&quot; With focused attention
and great care, you have to &quot;work out&quot; what God &quot;works in&quot;
you --- not <i>work</i> to accomplish or earn &quot;your own salvation,&quot;
but <i>work it out</i> so you will exhibit the evidence of a life based with
determined, unshakable faith on the complete and perfect redemption of the
Lord. As you do this, you do not bring an opposing will up against God''s will
--- God''s will <i>is</i> your will. Your natural choices will be in accordance
with God''s will, and living this life will be as natural as breathing.
Stubbornness is an unintelligent barrier, refusing enlightenment and blocking
its flow. The only thing to do with this barrier of stubbornness is to blow it
up with &quot;dynamite,&quot; and the &quot;dynamite&quot; is obedience to the
Holy Spirit.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Do
I believe that Almighty God is the Source of my will? God not only expects me
to do His will, but He is in me to do it.
