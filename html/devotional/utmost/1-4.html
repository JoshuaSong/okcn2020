<b>The
Life of Power to Follow

</b><span>(Joh 13:36)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>&nbsp;&quot;And
when He had spoken this, He said to him, ''Follow Me'' &quot; (<span
>Joh 21:19</span>). Three years earlier Jesus had said,
&quot;Follow Me&quot; (Mat 4:19</span>), and
Peter followed with no hesitation. The irresistible attraction of Jesus was
upon him and he did not need the Holy Spirit to help him do it. Later he came
to the place where he denied Jesus, and his heart broke. Then he received the
Holy Spirit and Jesus said again, &quot;Follow Me&quot; (<span
>Joh 21:19</span>). Now no one is in front of Peter
except the Lord Jesus Christ. The first &quot;Follow Me&quot; was nothing
mysterious; it was an external following. Jesus is now asking for an internal
sacrifice and yielding (Joh 21:18</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Between
these two times Peter denied Jesus with oaths and curses (<span
>Mat 26:69-75</span>). But then he came completely to
the end of himself and all of his self-sufficiency. There was no part of
himself he would ever rely on again. In his state of destitution, he was
finally ready to receive all that the risen Lord had for him. &quot;. . . He
breathed on them, and said to them, ''Receive the Holy Spirit'' &quot; (<span
>Joh 20:22</span>). No matter what changes God has
performed in you, never rely on them. Build only on a Person, the Lord Jesus
Christ, and on the Spirit He gives.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>All
our promises and resolutions end in denial because we have no power to
accomplish them. When we come to the end of ourselves, not just mentally but
completely, we are able to &quot;receive the Holy Spirit.&quot; <i>&quot;Receive
the Holy Spirit&quot;</i>--- the idea is that of invasion. There is now only
One who directs the course of your life, the Lord Jesus Christ.
