<b>What
To Renounce

</b><span>(2Co 4:2)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Have
you &quot;renounced the hidden things of shame&quot; in your life --- the
things that your sense of honor or pride will not allow to come into the light?
You can easily hide them. Is there a thought in your heart about anyone that
you would not like to be brought into the light? Then renounce it as soon as it
comes to mind --- renounce everything in its entirety until there is no hidden
dishonesty or craftiness about you at all. Envy, jealousy, and strife don''t
necessarily arise from your old nature of sin, but from the flesh which was
used for these kinds of things in the past (Rom 6:19,
1Pe 4:1-3</span>). You must maintain continual watchfulness so that nothing
arises in your life that would cause you shame.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;.
. . not walking in craftiness. . .&quot; (2Co 4:2</span>).
This means not resorting to something simply to make your own point. This is a
terrible trap. You know that God will allow you to work in only one way --- the
way of truth. Then be careful never to catch people through the other way ---
the way of deceit. If you act deceitfully, God''s blight and ruin will be upon
you. What may be craftiness for you, may not be for others --- God has called
you to a higher standard. Never dull your sense of being your utmost for His highestyour
best for His glory. For you, doing certain things would mean craftiness coming
into your life for a purpose other than what is the highest and best, and it
would dull the motivation that God has given you. Many people have turned back
because they are afraid to look at things from God''s perspective. The greatest
spiritual crisis comes when a person has to move a little farther on in his
faith than the beliefs he has already accepted.
