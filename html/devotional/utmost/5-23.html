<b>Our
Careful Unbelief

</b><span>(Mat 6:25)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Jesus
summed up commonsense carefulness in the life of a disciple as <i>unbelief.</i>
If we have received the Spirit of God, He will squeeze right through our lives,
as if to ask, &quot;Now where do I come into this relationship, this vacation
you have planned, or these new books you want to read?&quot; And He always
presses the point until we learn to make Him our first consideration. Whenever
we put other things first, there is confusion.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;.
. . do not worry about your life . . . .&quot; Don''t take the pressure of your
provision upon yourself. It is not only wrong to worry, it is unbelief;
worrying means we do not believe that God can look after the practical details
of our lives, and it is never anything but those details that worry us. Have
you ever noticed what Jesus said would choke the Word He puts in us? Is it the
devil? No ---- &quot;the cares of this world&quot; (Mat 13:22</span>).
It is always our little worries. We say, &quot;I will not trust when I cannot
see&quot; --- and that is where unbelief begins. The only cure for unbelief is
obedience to the Spirit.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
greatest word of Jesus to His disciples is <i>abandon.</i>
