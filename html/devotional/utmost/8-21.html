<b>The
Ministry of the Unnoticed

</b><span>(Mat 5:3)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>The
New Testament notices things that do not seem worthy of notice by our
standards. &quot;Blessed are the poor in spirit . . . .&quot; This literally
means, &quot;Blessed are the paupers.&quot; Paupers are remarkably commonplace!
The preaching of today tends to point out a person''s strength of will or the
beauty of his character --- things that are easily noticed. The statement we so
often hear, &quot;Make a decision for Jesus Christ,&quot; places the emphasis
on something our Lord never trusted. He never asks us to decide for Him, but to
yield to Him --- something very different. At the foundation of Jesus Christ''s
kingdom is the genuine loveliness of those who are commonplace. I am truly
blessed in my poverty. If I have no strength of will and a nature without worth
or excellence, then Jesus says to me, &quot;Blessed are you, because it is through
your poverty that you can enter My kingdom.&quot; I cannot enter His kingdom by
virtue of my goodness --- I can only enter it as an absolute pauper.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
true character of the loveliness that speaks for God is always unnoticed by the
one possessing that quality. Conscious influence is prideful and unchristian.
If I wonder if I am being of any use to God, I instantly lose the beauty and
the freshness of the touch of the Lord. &quot;He who believes in Me . . . out
of his heart will flow rivers of living water&quot; (<span style='color:
black'>Joh 7:38</span>). And if I examine the outflow, I lose the touch of
the Lord.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Who
are the people who have influenced us most? Certainly not the ones who thought
they did, but those who did not have even the slightest idea that they were
influencing us. In the Christian life, godly influence is never conscious of
itself. If we are conscious of our influence, it ceases to have the genuine
loveliness which is characteristic of the touch of Jesus. We always know when
Jesus is at work because He produces in the commonplace something that is
inspiring.
