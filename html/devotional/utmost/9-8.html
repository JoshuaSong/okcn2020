<b>Do
It Yourself

</b><span>(2Co 10:5)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/><b>Determinedly
Demolish Some Things.</b>
Deliverance from sin is not the same as deliverance from human nature. There
are things in human nature, such as prejudices, that the saint can only destroy
through sheer neglect. But there are other things that have to be destroyed
through violence, that is, through God''s divine strength imparted by His
Spirit. There are some things over which we are not to fight, but only to
&quot;stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord . . .&quot; (<span
>Exo 14:13</span>). But every theory or thought that
raises itself up as a fortified barrier &quot;against the knowledge of
God&quot; is to be determinedly demolished by drawing on God''s power, not
through human effort or by compromise (2Co 10:4</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>It
is only when God has transformed our nature and we have entered into the
experience of sanctification that the fight begins. The warfare is not against
sin; we can never fight against sin --- Jesus Christ conquered that in His
redemption of us. The conflict is waged over turning our natural life into a
spiritual life. This is never done easily, nor does God intend that it be so.
It is accomplished only through a series of moral choices. God does not make us
holy in the sense that He makes our character holy. He makes us holy in the
sense that He has made us innocent before Him. And then we have to turn that
innocence into holy character through the moral choices we make. These choices
are continually opposed and hostile to the things of our natural life which
have become so deeply entrenched --- the very things that raise themselves up as
fortified barriers &quot;against the knowledge of God.&quot; We can either turn
back, making ourselves of no value to the kingdom of God, or we can
determinedly demolish these things, allowing Jesus to bring another son to
glory (Heb 2:10</span>).
