<b>Held
by the Grip of God 

</b><span>(Phi 3:12)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Never
choose to be a worker for God, but once God has placed His call on you, woe be
to you if you &quot;turn aside to the right hand or to the left&quot; (<span
>Deu 5:32</span>). We are not here to work for God
because we have chosen to do so, but because God has &quot;laid hold of&quot;
us. And once He has done so, we never have this thought, &quot;Well, I&acirc;�&#8482;m
really not suited for this.&quot; What you are to preach is also determined by
God, not by your own natural leanings or desires. Keep your soul steadfastly
related to God, and remember that you are called not simply to convey your
testimony but also to preach the gospel. Every Christian must testify to the
truth of God, but when it comes to the call to preach, there must be the
agonizing grip of God&acirc;�&#8482;s hand on you --- your life is in the grip of God for
that very purpose. How many of us are held like that? 

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Never
water down the Word of God, but preach it in its undiluted sternness. There
must be unflinching faithfulness to the Word of God, but when you come to
personal dealings with others, remember who you are --- you are not some
special being created in heaven, but a sinner saved by grace. 

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;Brethren,
I do not count myself to have apprehended; but <i>one thing I do</i>. . . I
press toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ
