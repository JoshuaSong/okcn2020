<b>The
Collision of God and Sin

</b><span>(1Pe 2:24)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>The
Cross of Christ is the revealed truth of God''s judgment on sin. Never
associate the idea of martyrdom with the Cross of Christ. It was the supreme
triumph, and it shook the very foundations of hell. There is nothing in time or
eternity more absolutely certain and irrefutable than what Jesus Christ
accomplished on the Cross --- He made it possible for the entire human race to
be brought back into a right-standing relationship with God. He made redemption
the foundation of human life; that is, He made a way for every person to have
fellowship with God.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
Cross was not something that <i>happened</i> to Jesus --- He came to die; the
Cross was His purpose in coming. He is &quot;the Lamb slain from the foundation
of the world&quot; (Rev 13:8</span>). The
incarnation of Christ would have no meaning without the Cross. Beware of
separating <i>&quot;God was manifested in the flesh</i> . . .&quot; from
&quot;. . . <i>He made Him . . . to be sin for us</i> . . .&quot; (<span
>1Ti 3:16, 2Co 5:21</span>). The purpose of the
incarnation was redemption. God came in the flesh to take sin away, not to
accomplish something for Himself. The Cross is the central event in time and
eternity, and the answer to all the problems of both.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
Cross is not the cross of a man, but the Cross of God, and it can never be
fully comprehended through human experience. The Cross is God exhibiting His
nature. It is the gate through which any and every individual can enter into
oneness with God. But it is not a gate we pass right through; it is one where
we abide in the life that is found there.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
heart of salvation is the Cross of Christ. The reason salvation is so easy to
obtain is that it cost God so much. The Cross was the place where God and
sinful man merged with a tremendous collision and where the way to life was
opened. But all the cost and pain of the collision was absorbed by the heart of
God.
