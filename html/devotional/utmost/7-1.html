<b>The
Inevitable Penalty

</b><span>(Mat 5:26)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>There
is no heaven that has a little corner of hell in it. God is determined to make
you pure, holy, and right, and He will not allow you to escape from the
scrutiny of the Holy Spirit for even one moment. He urged you to come to
judgment immediately when He convicted you, but you did not obey. Then the
inevitable process began to work, bringing its inevitable penalty. Now you have
been &quot;thrown into prison, [and] . . . you will by no means get out of
there till you have paid the last penny&quot; (Mat 5:25-26</span>)
. Yet you ask, &quot;Is this a God of mercy and love?&quot; When seen from
God''s perspective, it is a glorious ministry of love. God is going to bring
you out pure, spotless, and undefiled, but He wants you to recognize the nature
you were exhibiting --- the nature of demanding your right to yourself. The
moment you are willing for God to change your nature, His recreating forces
will begin to work. And the moment you realize that God''s purpose is to get
you into the right relationship with Himself and then with others, He will
reach to the very limits of the universe to help you take the right road.
Decide to do it right now, saying, &quot;Yes, Lord, I <i>will</i> write that
letter,&quot; or, &quot;I <i>will</i> be reconciled to that person now.&quot;

<br/>These
sermons of Jesus Christ are meant for your will and your conscience, not for
your head. If you dispute these verses from the Sermon on the Mount with your
head, you will dull the appeal to your heart.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>If
you find yourself asking, &quot;I wonder why I''m not growing spiritually with
God?&quot; --- then ask yourself if you are paying your debts from God''s
standpoint. Do <i>now</i> what you will have to do someday. Every moral
question or call comes with an &quot;ought&quot; behind it --- the knowledge of
knowing what we ought to do.
