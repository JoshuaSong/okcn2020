<b>Look
Again and Consecrate

</b><span>(Mat 6:30)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>&nbsp;A
simple statement of Jesus is always a puzzle to us because we will not be
simple. How can we maintain the simplicity of Jesus so that we may understand
Him? By receiving His Spirit, recognizing and relying on Him, and obeying Him
as He brings us the truth of His Word, life will become amazingly simple. Jesus
asks us to consider that &quot;if God so clothes the grass of the field . .
.&quot; how &quot;much more&quot; will He clothe you, if you keep your
relationship right with Him? Every time we lose ground in our fellowship with
God, it is because we have disrespectfully thought that we knew better than
Jesus Christ. We have allowed &quot;the cares of this world&quot; to enter in (<span
>Mat 13:22</span>), while forgetting the &quot;much
more&quot; of our heavenly Father.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;Look
at the birds of the air . . .&quot; (Mat 6:26</span>).
Their function is to obey the instincts God placed within them, and God watches
over them. Jesus said that if you have the right relationship with Him and will
obey His Spirit within you, then God will care for your &quot;feathers&quot;
too.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;Consider
the lilies of the field . . .&quot; (Mat 6:28</span>).
They grow where they are planted. Many of us refuse to grow where God plants
us. Therefore, we don''t take root anywhere. Jesus said if we would obey the
life of God within us, He would look after all other things. Did Jesus Christ
lie to us? Are we experiencing the &quot;much more&quot; He promised? If we are
not, it is because we are not obeying the life God has given us and have
cluttered our minds with confusing thoughts and worries. How much time have we
wasted asking God senseless questions while we should be absolutely free to
concentrate on our service to Him? Consecration is the act of continually
separating myself from everything except that which God has appointed me to do.
It is not a one-time experience but an ongoing process. Am I continually separating
myself and looking to God every day of my life?
