<b>Complete
and Effective Decision About Sin

</b><span>(Rom 6:6)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/><b>Co-Crucifixion.</b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Trebuchet MS","sans-serif"'> Have you made the
following decision about sin --- that it must be completely killed in you? It
takes a long time to come to the point of making this complete and effective
decision about sin. It is, however, the greatest moment in your life once you
decide that sin must die in you --- not simply be restrained, suppressed, or
counteracted, but crucified --- just as Jesus Christ died for the sin of the
world. No one can bring anyone else to this decision. We may be mentally and
spiritually convinced, but what we need to do is actually make the decision
that Paul urged us to do in this passage.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Pull
yourself up, take some time alone with God, and make this important decision,
saying, &quot;Lord, identify me with Your death until I know that sin is dead
in me.&quot; Make the moral decision that sin in you must be put to death.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>This
was not some divine future expectation on the part of Paul, but was a very
radical and definite experience in his life. Are you prepared to let the Spirit
of God search you until you know what the level and nature of sin is in your
life --- to see the very things that struggle against God''s Spirit in you? If
so, will you then agree with God''s verdict on the nature of sin --- that it
should be identified with the death of Jesus? You cannot &quot;reckon
yourselves to be dead indeed to sin&quot; (Rom 6:11</span>)
unless you have radically dealt with the issue of your will before God.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Have
you entered into the glorious privilege of being crucified with Christ, until
all that remains in your flesh and blood is His life? &quot;I have been
crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me . .
.&quot; (Gal 2:20</span>).
