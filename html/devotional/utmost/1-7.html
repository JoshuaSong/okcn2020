<b>Is
My Sacrifice Living?

</b><span>(Gen 22:9)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>&nbsp;This
event is a picture of the mistake we make in thinking that the ultimate God
wants of us is the sacrifice of death. What God wants is the sacrifice <i>through</i>
death which enables us to do what Jesus did, that is, sacrifice our lives. Not
--- &quot;Lord, I am ready to go with You . . . to death&quot; (<span
>Luk 22:33</span>). But --- &quot;I am willing to be
identified with Your death so that I may sacrifice my life to God.&quot;

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>We
seem to think that God wants us to give up things! God purified Abraham from
this error, and the same process is at work in our lives. God never tells us to
give up things just for the sake of giving them up, but He tells us to give
them up for the sake of the only thing worth having, namely, life with Himself.
It is a matter of loosening the bands that hold back our lives. Those bands are
loosened immediately by identification with the death of Jesus. Then we enter
into a relationship with God whereby we may sacrifice our lives to Him.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>It
is of no value to God to give Him your life for death. He wants you to be a
&quot;<i>living</i> sacrifice --- &quot;to let Him have all your strengths that
have been saved and sanctified through Jesus (Rom 12:1</span>).
This is what is acceptable to God.
