<b>The
Focus Of Our Message

</b><span>(Mat 10:34)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Never
be sympathetic with a person whose situation causes you to conclude that God is
dealing harshly with him. God can be more tender than we can conceive, and
every once in a while He gives us the opportunity to deal firmly with someone
so that He may be viewed as the tender One. If a person cannot go to God, it is
because he has something secret which he does not intend to give up --- he may
admit his sin, but would no more give up that thing than he could fly under his
own power. It is impossible to deal sympathetically with people like that. We
must reach down deep in their lives to the root of the problem, which will
cause hostility and resentment toward the message. People want the blessing of
God, but they can''t stand something that pierces right through to the heart of
the matter.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>If
you are sensitive to God''s way, your message as His servant will be merciless
and insistent, cutting to the very root. Otherwise, there will be no healing.
We must drive the message home so forcefully that a person cannot possibly
hide, but must apply its truth. Deal with people where they are, until they
begin to realize their true need. Then hold high the standard of Jesus for
their lives. Their response may be, &quot;We can never be that.&quot; Then
drive it home with, &quot;Jesus Christ says you must.&quot; &quot;But how can
we be?&quot; &quot;You can''t, unless you have a new Spirit&quot; (<span
>Luk 11:13</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>There
must be a sense of need created before your message is of any use. Thousands of
people in this world profess to be happy without God. But if we could be truly
happy and moral without Jesus, then why did He come? He came because that kind
of happiness and peace is only superficial. Jesus Christ came to &quot;bring .
. . a sword&quot; through every kind of peace that is not based on a personal
relationship with Himself.
