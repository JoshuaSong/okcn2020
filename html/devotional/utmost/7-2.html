<b>The
Conditions of Discipleship

</b><span>(Luk 14:26-27, Luk 14:33)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>If
the closest relationships of a disciple''s life conflict with the claims of
Jesus Christ, then our Lord requires instant obedience to Himself. Discipleship
means personal, passionate devotion to a Person --- our Lord Jesus Christ.
There is a vast difference between devotion to a person and devotion to
principles or to a cause. Our Lord never proclaimed a cause --- He proclaimed
personal devotion to Himself. To be a disciple is to be a devoted bondservant
motivated by love for the Lord Jesus. Many of us who call ourselves Christians
are not truly devoted to Jesus Christ. No one on earth has this passionate love
for the Lord Jesus unless the Holy Spirit has given it to him. We may admire,
respect, and revere Him, but we cannot love Him on our own. The only One who
truly loves the Lord Jesus is the Holy Spirit, and it is He who has
&quot;poured out in our hearts&quot; the very &quot;love of God&quot; (<span
>Rom 5:5</span>). Whenever the Holy Spirit sees an
opportunity to glorify Jesus through you, He will take your entire being and
set you ablaze with glowing devotion to Jesus Christ.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
Christian life is a life characterized by true and spontaneous creativity.
Consequently, a disciple is subject to the same charge that was leveled against
Jesus Christ, namely, the charge of inconsistency. But Jesus Christ was always
consistent in His relationship to God, and a Christian must be consistent in
his relationship to the life of the Son of God in him, not consistent to
strict, unyielding doctrines. People pour themselves into their own doctrines,
and God has to blast them out of their preconceived ideas before they can
become devoted to Jesus Christ.
