<b>Vision
and Darkness

</b><span>(Gen 15:12)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>&nbsp;Whenever
God gives a vision to a Christian, it is as if He puts him in &quot;the shadow
of His hand&quot; (Isa 49:2</span>). The
saint''s duty is to be still and listen. There is a &quot;darkness&quot; that
comes from too much light --- that is the time to listen. The story of Abram
and Hagar in Genesis 16 is an excellent example of listening to so-called good
advice during a time of darkness, rather than waiting for God to send the
light. When God gives you a vision and darkness follows, wait. God will bring
the vision He has given you to reality in your life if you will wait on His timing.
Never try to help God fulfill His word. Abram went through thirteen years of
silence, but in those years all of his self-sufficiency was destroyed. He grew
past the point of relying on his own common sense. Those years of silence were
a time of discipline, not a period of God''s displeasure. There is never any
need to pretend that your life is filled with joy and confidence; just wait
upon God and be grounded in Him (Isa 50:10-11</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Do
I trust at all in the flesh? Or have I learned to go beyond all confidence in
myself and other people of God? Do I trust in books and prayers or other joys
in my life? Or have I placed my confidence in God <i>Himself,</i> not in His
blessings? &quot;I am Almighty God . . .&quot; --- El-Shaddai, the All-Powerful
God (Gen 17:1</span>). The reason we are all
being disciplined is that we will know God is real. As soon as God becomes real
to us, people pale by comparison, becoming shadows of reality. Nothing that
other saints do or say can ever upset the one who is built on God.
