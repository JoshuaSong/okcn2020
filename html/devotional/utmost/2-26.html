<b>The
Impoverished Ministry of Jesus

</b><span>(Joh 4:11)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;The
well is deep&quot; --- and even a great deal deeper than the Samaritan woman
knew! (Joh 4:11</span>). Think of the depths
of human nature and human life; think of the depth of the &quot;wells&quot; in
you. Have you been limiting, or impoverishing, the ministry of Jesus to the
point that He is unable to work in your life? Suppose that you have a deep
&quot;well&quot; of hurt and trouble inside your heart, and Jesus comes and says
to you, &quot;Let not your heart be troubled . . .&quot; (<span
>Joh 14:1</span>). Would your response be to shrug your
shoulders and say, &quot;But, Lord, the well is too deep, and even You can''t
draw up quietness and comfort out of it.&quot; Actually, that is correct. Jesus
doesn''t bring anything up from the wells of human nature --- He brings them
down from above. We limit the Holy One of Israel by remembering only what we
have allowed Him to do for us in the past, and also by saying, &quot;Of course,
I cannot expect God to do this particular thing.&quot; The thing that
approaches the very limits of His power is the very thing we as disciples of
Jesus ought to believe He will do. We impoverish and weaken His ministry in us
the moment we forget He is almighty. The impoverishment is in us, not in Him.
We will come to Jesus for Him to be our comforter or our sympathizer, but we
refrain from approaching Him as our Almighty God.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
reason some of us are such poor examples of Christianity is that we have failed
to recognize that Christ is almighty. We have Christian attributes and
experiences, but there is no abandonment or surrender to Jesus Christ. When we
get into difficult circumstances, we impoverish His ministry by saying,
&quot;Of course, He can''t do anything about this.&quot; We struggle to reach
the bottom of our own well, trying to get water for ourselves. Beware of
sitting back, and saying, &quot;It can''t be done.&quot; You will know it can
be done if you will look to Jesus. The well of your incompleteness runs deep,
but make the effort to look away from yourself and to look toward Him.
