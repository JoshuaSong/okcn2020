<b>Going
Through Spiritual Confusion

</b><span>(Mat 20:22)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>There
are times in your spiritual life when there is confusion, and the way out of it
is not simply to say that you should not be confused. It is not a matter of
right and wrong, but a matter of God taking you through a way that you
temporarily do not understand. And it is only by going through the spiritual
confusion that you will come to the understanding of what God wants for you.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/><b>The
Shrouding of His Friendship</b>
(Luk 11:5-8</span>). Jesus gave the
illustration here of a man who appears not to care for his friend. He was
saying, in effect, that is how the heavenly Father will appear to you at times.
You will think that He is an unkind friend, but remember --- He is not. The
time will come when everything will be explained. There seems to be a cloud on
the friendship of the heart, and often even love itself has to wait in pain and
tears for the blessing of fuller fellowship and oneness. When God appears to be
completely shrouded, will you hang on with confidence in Him?

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/><b>The
Shadow on His Fatherhood</b>
(Luk 11:11-13</span>). Jesus said that there
are times when your Father will appear as if He were an unnatural father --- as
if He were callous and indifferent --- but remember, He is not. &quot;Everyone
who asks receives . . .&quot; (Luk 11:10</span>).
If all you see is a shadow on the face of the Father right now, hang on to the
fact that He will ultimately give you clear understanding and will fully
justify Himself in everything that He has allowed into your life.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/><b>The
Strangeness of His Faithfulness</b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:
"Trebuchet MS","sans-serif"'> (Luk 18:1-8</span>).
&quot;When the Son of Man comes, will He really find faith on the earth?&quot;
(Luk 18:8</span>). Will He find the kind of
faith that counts on Him in spite of the confusion? Stand firm in faith,
believing that what Jesus said is true, although in the meantime you do not
understand what God is doing. He has bigger issues at stake than the particular
things you are asking of Him right now.
