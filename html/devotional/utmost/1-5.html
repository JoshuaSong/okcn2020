<b>Worship

</b><span>(Gen 12:8)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>&nbsp;Worship
is giving God the best that He has given you. Be careful what you do with the
best you have. Whenever you get a blessing from God, give it back to Him as a
love-gift. Take time to meditate before God and offer the blessing back to Him
in a deliberate act of worship. If you hoard it for yourself, it will turn into
spiritual dry rot, as the manna did when it was hoarded (<span
>Exo 16:20</span>). God will never allow you to keep a
spiritual blessing completely for yourself. It must be given back to Him so
that He can make it a blessing to others.

<br/>Bethel
is the symbol of fellowship with God; Ai is the symbol of the world. Abram
&quot;pitched his tent&quot; between the two. The lasting value of our public
service for God is measured by the depth of the intimacy of our private times
of fellowship and oneness with Him. Rushing in and out of worship is wrong
every time --- there is always plenty of time to worship God. Days set apart
for quiet can be a trap, detracting from the need to have daily quiet time with
God. That is why we must &quot;pitch our tents&quot; where we will always have
quiet times with Him, however noisy our times with the world may be. There are
not three levels of spiritual life --- worship, waiting, and work. Yet some of
us seem to jump like spiritual frogs from worship to waiting, and from waiting
to work. God''s idea is that the three should go together as one. They were
always together in the life of our Lord and in perfect harmony. It is a
discipline that must be developed; it will not happen overnight.
