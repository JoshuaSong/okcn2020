<b>Continuous
Conversion

</b><span>(Mat 18:3)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>These
words of our Lord refer to our initial conversion, but we should continue to
turn to God as children, being continuously converted every day of our lives.
If we trust in our own abilities, instead of God''s, we produce consequences
for which God will hold us responsible. When God through His sovereignty brings
us into new situations, we should immediately make sure that our natural life
submits to the spiritual, obeying the orders of the Spirit of God. Just because
we have responded properly in the past is no guarantee that we will do so
again. The response of the natural to the spiritual should be continuous
conversion, but this is where we so often refuse to be obedient. No matter what
our situation is, the Spirit of God remains unchanged and His salvation
unaltered. But we must &quot;put on the new man . . .&quot; (<span
>Eph 4:24</span>). God holds us accountable every time
we refuse to convert ourselves, and He sees our refusal as willful
disobedience. Our natural life must not rule --- God must rule in us.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>To
refuse to be continuously converted puts a stumbling block in the growth of our
spiritual life. There are areas of self-will in our lives where our pride pours
contempt on the throne of God and says, &quot;I won''t submit.&quot; We deify
our independence and self-will and call them by the wrong name. What God sees
as stubborn weakness, we call strength. There are whole areas of our lives that
have not yet been brought into submission, and this can only be done by this
continuous conversion. Slowly but surely we can claim the whole territory for
the Spirit of God.
