<b>Building
For Eternity

</b><span>(Luk 14:28)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Our
Lord was not referring here to a cost which we have to count, but to a cost
which He has already counted. The cost was those thirty years in Nazareth,
those three years of popularity, scandal, and hatred, the unfathomable agony He
experienced in Gethsemane, and the assault upon Him at Calvarythe central point
upon which all of time and eternity turn. Jesus Christ has counted the cost. In
the final analysis, people are not going to laugh at Him and say, &quot;This
man began to build and was not able to finish&quot; Luk 14:30</span>.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
conditions of discipleship given to us by our Lord in verses 26, 27, and 33
mean that the men and women He is going to use in His mighty building
enterprises are those in whom He has done everything. &quot;If anyone comes to
Me and does not hate his father and mother, wife and children, brothers and
sisters, yes, and his own life also, <i>he cannot be My disciple&quot;</i> <span
>Luk 14:26</span>. This verse teaches us that the only
men and women our Lord will use in His building enterprises are those who love
Him personally, passionately, and with great devotionthose who have a love for Him
that goes far beyond any of the closest relationships on earth. The conditions
are strict, but they are glorious.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>All
that we build is going to be inspected by God. When God inspects us with His
searching and refining fire, will He detect that we have built enterprises of
our own on the foundation of Jesus? 1Co 3:10-15</span>.
We are living in a time of tremendous enterprises, a time when we are trying to
work for God, and that is where the trap is. Profoundly speaking, we can never
work for God. Jesus, as the Master Builder, takes us over so that He may direct
and control us completely for <i>His</i> enterprises and <i>His</i> building
plans; and no one has any right to demand where he will be put to work.
