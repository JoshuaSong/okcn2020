<b>The
Failure To Pay Close Attention

</b><span>(2Ch 15:17)

<br/>Asa
was not completely obedient in the outward, visible areas of his life. He was
obedient in what he considered the most important areas, but he was not
entirely right. Beware of ever thinking, &quot;Oh, that thing in my life
doesn''t matter much.&quot; The fact that it doesn''t matter much to you may
mean that it matters a great deal to God. Nothing should be considered a
trivial matter by a child of God. How much longer are we going to prevent God
from teaching us even one thing? But He keeps trying to teach us and He never
loses patience. You say, &quot;I know I am right with God&quot; --- yet the
&quot;high places&quot; still remain in your life. There is still an area of
disobedience. Do you protest that your heart is right with God, and yet there
is something in your life He causes you to doubt? Whenever God causes a doubt
about something, stop it immediately, no matter what it may be. Nothing in our
lives is a mere insignificant detail to God.

<br/>Are
there some things regarding your physical or intellectual life to which you
have been paying no attention at all? If so, you may think you are all correct
in the important areas, but you are careless --- you are failing to concentrate
or to focus properly. You no more need a day off from spiritual concentration
on matters in your life than your heart needs a day off from beating. As you
cannot take a day off morally and remain moral, neither can you take a day off
spiritually and remain spiritual. God wants you to be entirely His, and it
requires paying close attention to keep yourself fit. It also takes a
tremendous amount of time. Yet some of us expect to rise above all of our
problems, going from one mountaintop experience to another, with only a few
minutes'' effort.
