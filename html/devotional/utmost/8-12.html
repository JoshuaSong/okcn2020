<b>The
Theology of Resting in God

</b><span>(Mat 8:26)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>When
we are afraid, the least we can do is pray to God. But our Lord has a right to
expect that those who name His name have an underlying confidence in Him. God
expects His children to be so confident in Him that in any crisis they are the
ones who are reliable. Yet our trust is only in God up to a certain point, then
we turn back to the elementary panic-stricken prayers of those people who do
not even know God. We come to our wits'' end, showing that we don''t have even
the slightest amount of confidence in Him or in His sovereign control of the
world. To us He seems to be asleep, and we can see nothing but giant, breaking
waves on the sea ahead of us.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;.
. . O you of little faith!&quot; What a stinging pain must have shot through
the disciples as they surely thought to themselves, &quot;We missed the mark
again!&quot; And what a sharp pain will go through us when we suddenly realize
that we could have produced complete and utter joy in the heart of Jesus by
remaining absolutely confident in Him, in spite of what we were facing.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>There
are times when there is no storm or crisis in our lives, and we do all that is
humanly possible. But it is when a crisis arises that we instantly reveal upon
whom we rely. If we have been learning to worship God and to place our trust in
Him, the crisis will reveal that we can go to the point of breaking, yet
without breaking our confidence in Him.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>We
have been talking quite a lot about sanctification, but what will be the result
in our lives? It will be expressed in our lives as a peaceful resting in God,
which means a total oneness with Him. And this oneness will make us not only
blameless in His sight, but also a profound joy to Him.
