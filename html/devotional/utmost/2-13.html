<b>The
Discipline of Hearing

</b><span>(Mat 10:27)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Sometimes
God puts us through the experience and discipline of darkness to teach us to
hear and obey Him. Song birds are taught to sing in the dark, and God puts us
into &quot;the shadow of His hand&quot; until we learn to hear Him (<span
>Isa 49:2</span>). &quot;Whatever I tell you in the
dark. . .&quot; --- pay attention when God puts you into darkness, and keep
your mouth closed while you are there. Are you in the dark right now in your
circumstances, or in your life with God? If so, then remain quiet. If you open
your mouth in the dark, you will speak while in the wrong mood --- darkness is
the time to listen. Don''t talk to other people about it; don''t read books to
find out the reason for the darkness; just listen and obey. If you talk to
other people, you cannot hear what God is saying. When you are in the dark,
listen, and God will give you a very precious message for someone else once you
are back in the light.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>After
every time of darkness, we should experience a mixture of delight and
humiliation. If there is only delight, I question whether we have really heard
God at all. We should experience delight for having heard God speak, but mostly
humiliation for having taken so long to hear Him! Then we will exclaim,
&quot;How slow I have been to listen and understand what God has been telling
me!&quot; And yet God has been saying it for days and even weeks. But once you
hear Him, He gives you the gift of humiliation, which brings a softness of
heart --- a gift that will always cause you to listen to God <i>now.</i>
