<b>Winning
into Freedom

</b><span>(Joh 8:36)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>If
there is even a trace of individual self-satisfaction left in us, it always
says, &quot;I can''t surrender,&quot; or &quot;I can''t be free.&quot; But the
spiritual part of our being never says &quot;I can''t&quot;; it simply soaks up
everything around it. Our spirit hungers for more and more. It is the way we
are built. We are designed with a great capacity for God, but sin, our own
individuality, and wrong thinking keep us from getting to Him. God delivers us
from sin --- we have to deliver ourselves from our individuality. This means
offering our natural life to God and sacrificing it to Him, so He may transform
it into spiritual life through our obedience.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>God
pays no attention to our natural individuality in the development of our
spiritual life. His plan runs right through our natural life. We must see to it
that we aid and assist God, and not stand against Him by saying, &quot;I can''t
do that.&quot; God will not discipline us; we must discipline ourselves. God
will not bring our &quot;arguments . . . and every thought into captivity to
the obedience of Christ&quot; (2Co 10:5</span>)
--- we have to do it. Don''t say, &quot;Oh, Lord, I suffer from wandering
thoughts.&quot; <i>Don''t</i> suffer from wandering thoughts. Stop listening to
the tyranny of your individual natural life and win freedom into the spiritual
life.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;If
the Son makes you free . . . .&quot; Do not substitute <i>Savior</i> for <i>Son</i>
in this passage. The <i>Savior</i> has set us free from sin, but this is the
freedom that comes from being set free from myself <i>by the Son.</i> It is
what Paul meant in (Gal 2:20</span>) when he
said, &quot;I have been crucified with Christ . . . .&quot; His individuality
had been broken and his spirit had been united with his Lord; not just merged
into Him, but made one with Him. &quot;. . . you shall be free indeed&quot; ---
free to the very core of your being; free from the inside to the outside. We
tend to rely on our own energy, instead of being energized by the power that
comes from identification with Jesus.
