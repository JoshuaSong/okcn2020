<b>The
Key to the Missionary''s Message

</b><span>(1Jo 2:2)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>The
key to the missionary''s message is the propitiation of Christ Jesus --- His
sacrifice for us that completely satisfied the wrath of God. Look at any other
aspect of Christ''s work, whether it is healing, saving, or sanctifying, and
you will see that there is nothing limitless about those. But --- &quot;The
Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!&quot; --- that is limitless (<span
>Joh 1:29</span>). The missionary''s message is the
limitless importance of Jesus Christ as the propitiation for our sins, and a
missionary is someone who is immersed in the truth of that revelation.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
real key to the missionary''s message is the &quot;remissionary&quot; aspect of
Christ''s life, not His kindness, His goodness, or even His revealing of the
fatherhood of God to us. &quot;. . . repentance and <i>remission</i> of sins
should be preached . . . to all nations . . .&quot; (<span style='color:
black'>Luk 24:47</span>). The greatest message of limitless importance is
that &quot;He Himself is the propitiation for our sins . . . .&quot; The
missionary''s message is not nationalistic, favoring nations or individuals; it
is &quot;for the whole world.&quot; When the Holy Spirit comes into me, He does
not consider my partialities or preferences; He simply brings me into oneness
with the Lord Jesus.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>A
missionary is someone who is bound by marriage to the stated mission and
purpose of his Lord and Master. He is not to proclaim his own point of view,
but is only to proclaim &quot;the Lamb of God.&quot; It is easier to belong to
a faction that simply tells what Jesus Christ has done for me, and easier to
become a devotee of divine healing, or of a special type of sanctification, or
of the baptism of the Holy Spirit. But Paul did not say, &quot;Woe is me if I
do not preach what Christ has done for me,&quot; but, &quot;. . . woe is me if
I do not preach the gospel!&quot; (1Co 9:16</span>).
And this is the gospel ---&quot;the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the
world!&quot;
