<b>Individual
Discouragement and Personal Growth

</b><span>(Exo 2:11)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Moses
saw the oppression of his people and felt certain that he was the one to
deliver them, and in the righteous indignation of his own spirit he started to
right their wrongs. After he launched his first strike for God and for what was
right, God allowed Moses to be driven into empty discouragement, sending him
into the desert to feed sheep for forty years. At the end of that time, God
appeared to Moses and said to him, &quot; ''. . . bring My people . . . out of
Egypt.'' But Moses said to God, ''Who am I that I should go . . . ?'' &quot; (<span
>Exo 3:10-11</span>). In the beginning Moses had realized
that he was the one to deliver the people, but he had to be trained and
disciplined by God first. He was right in his individual perspective, but he
was not the person for the work until he had learned true fellowship and
oneness with God.

<br/>We
may have the vision of God and a very clear understanding of what God wants,
and yet when we start to do it, there comes to us something equivalent to
Moses'' forty years in the wilderness. It''s as if God had ignored the entire
thing, and when we are thoroughly discouraged, God comes back and revives His
call to us. And then we begin to tremble and say, &quot;Who am I that I should
go . . . ?&quot; We must learn that God''s great stride is summed up in these
words ---&quot;I AM WHO I AM . . . has sent me to you&quot; (<span
>Exo 3:14</span>). We must also learn that our
individual effort for God shows nothing but disrespect for Him --- our
individuality is to be rendered radiant through a personal relationship with
God, so that He may be &quot;well pleased&quot; (Mat 3:17</span>).
We are focused on the right individual perspective of things; we have the
vision and can say, &quot;I know this is what God wants me to do.&quot; But we
have not yet learned to get into God''s stride. If you are going through a time
of discouragement, there is a time of great personal growth ahead.
