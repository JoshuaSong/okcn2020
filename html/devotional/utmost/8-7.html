<b>Prayer
in the Father''s House

</b><span>(Luk 2:46, Luk 2:49)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Our
Lord''s childhood was not immaturity waiting to grow into manhood --- His
childhood is an eternal fact. Am I a holy, innocent child of God as a result of
my identification with my Lord and Savior? Do I look at my life as being in my
Father''s house? Is the Son of God living in His Father''s house within me?

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
only abiding reality is God Himself, and His order comes to me moment by
moment. Am I continually in touch with the reality of God, or do I pray only
when things have gone wrong --- when there is some disturbance in my life? I
must learn to identify myself closely with my Lord in ways of holy fellowship
and oneness that some of us have not yet even begun to learn. &quot;. . . I
must be about My Father''s business&quot; --- and I must learn to live every moment
of my life in my Father''s house.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Think
about your own circumstances. Are you so closely identified with the Lord''s
life that you are simply a child of God, continually talking to Him and
realizing that everything comes from His hands? Is the eternal Child in you
living in His Father''s house? Is the grace of His ministering life being
worked out through you in your home, your business, and in your circle of
friends? Have you been wondering why you are going through certain
circumstances? In fact, it is not that <i>you</i> have to go through them. It
is because of your relationship with the Son of God who comes, through the
providential will of His Father, into your life. You must allow <i>Him</i> to
have His way with you, staying in perfect oneness with Him.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
life of your Lord is to become your vital, simple life, and the way He worked
and lived among people while here on earth must be the way He works and lives
in you.
