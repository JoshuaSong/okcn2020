<b>The
Hidden Life

</b><span>(Col 3:3)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>The
Spirit of God testifies to and confirms the simple, but almighty, security of
the life that &quot;is hidden with Christ in God.&quot; Paul continually
brought this out in his New Testament letters. We talk as if living a
sanctified life were the most uncertain and insecure thing we could do. Yet it
is the most secure thing possible, because it has Almighty God in and behind
it. The most dangerous and unsure thing is to try to live without God. For one
who is born again, it is easier to live in a right-standing relationship with
God than it is to go wrong, provided we heed God''s warnings and &quot;walk in
the light&quot; (1Jo 1:7</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>When
we think of being delivered from sin, being &quot;filled with the Spirit&quot;
(Eph 5:18</span>), and &quot;walk[ing] in the
light,&quot; we picture the peak of a great mountain. We see it as very high
and wonderful, but we say, &quot;Oh, I could never live up there!&quot;
However, when we do get there through God''s grace, we find it is not a
mountain peak at all, but a plateau with plenty of room to live and to grow.
&quot;You enlarged my path under me, so my feet did not slip&quot; (<span
>Psa 18:36</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>When
you really see Jesus, I defy you to doubt Him. If you see Him when He says,
&quot;Let not your heart be troubled . . .&quot; (Joh 14:27</span>),
I defy you to worry. It is virtually impossible to doubt when He is there.
Every time you are in personal contact with Jesus, His words are real to you.
&quot;My peace I give to you . . .&quot; (Joh 14:27</span>)
--- a peace which brings an unconstrained confidence and covers you completely,
from the top of your head to the soles of your feet. &quot;. . . your life is
hidden with Christ in God,&quot; and the peace of Jesus Christ that cannot be
disturbed has been imparted to you.
