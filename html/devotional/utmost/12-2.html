<b>Christian
Perfection

</b><span>(Phi 3:12)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>It
is a trap to presume that God wants to make us perfect specimens of what He can
do --- God''s purpose is to make us one with Himself. The emphasis of holiness
movements tends to be that God is producing specimens of holiness to put in His
museum. If you accept this concept of personal holiness, your life''s
determined purpose will not be for God, but for what you call the evidence of
God in your life. How can we say, &quot;It could never be God''s will for me to
be sick&quot;? If it was God''s will to bruise His own Son (<span
>Isa 53:10</span>), why shouldn''t He bruise you? What
shines forth and reveals God in your life is not your relative consistency to
an idea of what a saint should be, but your genuine, living relationship with
Jesus Christ, and your unrestrained devotion to Him whether you are well or
sick.

<br/>Christian
perfection is not, and never can be, human perfection. Christian perfection is
the perfection of a relationship with God that shows itself to be true even
amid the seemingly unimportant aspects of human life. When you obey the call of
Jesus Christ, the first thing that hits you is the pointlessness of the things
you have to do. The next thought that strikes you is that other people seem to
be living perfectly consistent lives. Such lives may leave you with the idea
that God is unnecessary --- that through your own human effort and devotion you
can attain God''s standard for your life. In a fallen world this can never be
done. I am called to live in such a perfect relationship with God that my life
produces a yearning for God in the lives of others, not admiration for myself.
Thoughts about myself hinder my usefulness to God. God''s purpose is not to
perfect me to make me a trophy in His showcase; He is getting me to the place
where He can use me. Let Him do what He wants.
