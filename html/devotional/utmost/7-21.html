<b>The
Doorway to the Kingdom

</b><span>(Mat 5:3)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Beware
of thinking of our Lord as only a teacher. If Jesus Christ is only a teacher,
then all He can do is frustrate me by setting a standard before me I cannot
attain. What is the point of presenting me with such a lofty ideal if I cannot
possibly come close to reaching it? I would be happier if I never knew it. What
good is there in telling me to be what I can never be --- to be &quot;pure in
heart&quot; (Mat 5:8</span>), to do more than
my duty, or to be completely devoted to God? I must know Jesus Christ as my
Savior before His teaching has any meaning for me other than that of a lofty
ideal which only leads to despair. But when I am born again by the Spirit of
God, I know that Jesus Christ did not come only to <i>teach</i>--- He came to <i>make
me what He teaches I should be.</i> The redemption means that Jesus Christ can
place within anyone the same nature that ruled His own life, and all the
standards God gives us are based on that nature.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
teaching of the Sermon on the Mount produces a sense of despair in the natural
man --- exactly what Jesus means for it to do. As long as we have some
self-righteous idea that we can carry out our Lord''s teaching, God will allow
us to continue until we expose our own ignorance by stumbling over some
obstacle in our way. Only then are we willing to come to Him as paupers and
receive from Him. &quot;Blessed are the poor in spirit . . . .&quot; This is
the first principle in the kingdom of God. The underlying foundation of Jesus
Christ''s kingdom is poverty, not possessions; not making decisions for Jesus,
but having such a sense of absolute futility that we finally admit, &quot;Lord,
I cannot even begin to do it.&quot; Then Jesus says, &quot;Blessed are you . .
.&quot; (Mat 5:11</span>). This is the doorway
to the kingdom, and yet it takes us so long to believe that we are actually
poor! The knowledge of our own poverty is what brings us to the proper place
where Jesus Christ accomplishes His work.
