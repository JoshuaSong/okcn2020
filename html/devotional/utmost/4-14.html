<b>Inner
Invincibility

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Whom
the Lord loves He chastens . . .&quot; (Heb 12:6</span>).
How petty our complaining is! Our Lord begins to bring us to the point where we
can have fellowship with Him, only to hear us moan and groan, saying, &quot;Oh
Lord, just let me be like other people!&quot; Jesus is asking us to get beside
Him and take one end of the yoke, so that we can pull together. That''s why
Jesus says to us, &quot;My yoke is easy and My burden is light&quot; (<span
>Mat 11:30</span>). Are you closely identified with the
Lord Jesus like that? If so, you will thank God when you feel the pressure of
His hand upon you.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;.
. . to those who have no might He increases strength&quot; (<span
>Isa 40:29</span>). God comes and takes us out of our
emotionalism, and then our complaining turns into a hymn of praise. The only
way to know the strength of God is to take the yoke of Jesus upon us and to
learn from Him.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;.
. . the joy of the Lord is your strength&quot; (Neh 8:10</span>).
Where do the saints get their joy? If we did not know some Christians well, we
might think from just observing them that they have no burdens at all to bear.
But we must lift the veil from our eyes. The fact that the peace, light, and
joy of God is in them is proof that a burden is there as well. The burden that
God places on us squeezes the grapes in our lives and produces the wine, but
most of us see only the wine and not the burden. No power on earth or in hell
can conquer the Spirit of God living within the human spirit; it creates an
inner invincibility.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>If
your life is producing only a whine, instead of the wine, then ruthlessly kick
it out. It is definitely a crime for a Christian to be weak in God''s strength.
