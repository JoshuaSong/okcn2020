<b>Vital
Intercession

</b><span>(Eph 6:18)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>As
we continue on in our intercession for others, we may find that our obedience
to God in interceding is going to cost those for whom we intercede more than we
ever thought. The danger in this is that we begin to intercede in sympathy with
those whom God was gradually lifting up to a totally different level in direct
answer to our prayers. Whenever we step back from our close identification with
God''s interest and concern for others and step into having emotional sympathy
with them, the vital connection with God is gone. We have then put our sympathy
and concern for them in the way, and this is a deliberate rebuke to God.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>It
is impossible for us to have living and vital intercession unless we are
perfectly and completely sure of God. And the greatest destroyer of that
confident relationship to God, so necessary for intercession, is our own
personal sympathy and preconceived bias. Identification with God is the key to
intercession, and whenever we stop being identified with Him it is because of
our sympathy with others, not because of sin. It is not likely that sin will
interfere with our intercessory relationship with God, but sympathy will. It is
sympathy with ourselves or with others that makes us say, &quot;I will not
allow that thing to happen.&quot; And instantly we are out of that vital
connection with God.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Vital
intercession leaves you with neither the time nor the inclination to pray for
your own &quot;sad and pitiful self.&quot; You do not have to struggle to keep
thoughts of yourself out, because they are not even there to be kept out of
your thinking. You are completely and entirely identified with God''s interests
and concerns in other lives. God gives us discernment in the lives of others to
call us to intercession for them, never so that we may find fault with them.
