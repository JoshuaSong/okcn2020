<b>Am
I Blessed Like This?

</b><span>(Mat 5:3-11)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>When
we first read the statements of Jesus, they seem wonderfully simple and
unstartling, and they sink unnoticed into our subconscious minds. For instance,
the Beatitudes initially seem to be merely soothing and beautiful precepts for
overly spiritual and seemingly useless people, but of very little practical use
in the rigid, fast-paced workdays of the world in which <i>we</i> live. We soon
find, however, that the Beatitudes contain the &quot;dynamite&quot; of the Holy
Spirit. And they &quot;explode&quot; when the circumstances of our lives cause
them to do so. When the Holy Spirit brings to our remembrance one of the
Beatitudes, we say, &quot;What a startling statement that is!&quot; Then we
must decide whether or not we will accept the tremendous spiritual upheaval
that will be produced in our circumstances if we obey His words. That is the
way the Spirit of God works. We do not need to be born again to apply the
Sermon on the Mount literally. The literal interpretation of the Sermon on the
Mount is as easy as child''s play. But the interpretation by the Spirit of God
as He applies our Lord''s statements to our circumstances is the strict and
difficult work of a saint.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
teachings of Jesus are all out of proportion when compared to our natural way
of looking at things, and they come to us initially with astonishing
discomfort. We gradually have to conform our walk and conversation to the
precepts of Jesus Christ as the Holy Spirit applies them to our circumstances.
The Sermon on the Mount is not a set of rules and regulations --- it is a
picture of the life we will live when the Holy Spirit is having His unhindered
way with us.
