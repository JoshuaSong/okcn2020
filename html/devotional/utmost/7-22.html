<br/><b>The
Death Side.</b>
In sanctification God has to deal with us on the death side as well as on the
life side. Sanctification requires our coming to the place of death, but many
of us spend so much time there that we become morbid. There is always a
tremendous battle before sanctification is realized --- something within us
pushing with resentment against the demands of Christ. When the Holy Spirit
begins to show us what sanctification means, the struggle starts immediately.
Jesus said, &quot;If anyone comes to Me and does not hate . . . his own life .
. . he cannot be My disciple&quot; (Luk 14:26</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>In
the process of sanctification, the Spirit of God will strip me down until there
is nothing left but myself, and that is the place of death. Am I willing to be
myself and nothing more? Am I willing to have no friends, no father, no
brother, and no self-interest --- simply to be ready for death? That is the
condition required for sanctification. No wonder Jesus said, &quot;I did not
come to bring peace but a sword&quot; (Mat 10:34</span>).
This is where the battle comes, and where so many of us falter. We refuse to be
identified with the death of Jesus Christ on this point. We say, &quot;But this
is so strict. Surely He does not require that of me.&quot; Our Lord <i>is</i>
strict, and He <i>does</i> require that of us.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Am
I willing to reduce myself down to simply &quot;me&quot;? Am I determined
enough to strip myself of all that my friends think of me, and all that I think
of myself? Am I willing and determined to hand over my simple naked self to
God? Once I am, He will immediately sanctify me completely, and my life will be
free from being determined and persistent toward anything except God (<span
>1Th 5:23-24</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>When
I pray, &quot;Lord, show me what sanctification means for me,&quot; He will
show me. It means being made one with Jesus. Sanctification is not something
Jesus puts in me --- it is <i>Himself</i> in me (1Co 1:30</span>).
