<b>The
Ministry of the Inner Life

</b><span>(1Pe 2:9)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>By
what right have we become &quot;a royal priesthood&quot;? It is by the right of
the atonement by the Cross of Christ that this has been accomplished. Are we
prepared to purposely disregard ourselves and to launch out into the priestly
work of prayer? The continual inner-searching we do in an effort to see if we
are what we ought to be generates a self-centered, sickly type of Christianity,
not the vigorous and simple life of a child of God. Until we get into this
right and proper relationship with God, it is simply a case of our
&quot;hanging on by the skin of our teeth,&quot; although we say, &quot;What a
wonderful victory I have!&quot; Yet there is nothing at all in that which
indicates the miracle of redemption. Launch out in reckless, unrestrained
belief that the redemption is complete. Then don''t worry anymore about
yourself, but begin to do as Jesus Christ has said, in essence, &quot;Pray for
the friend who comes to you at midnight, pray for the saints of God, and pray
for all men.&quot; Pray with the realization that you are perfect only in
Christ Jesus, not on the basis of this argument: &quot;Oh, Lord, I have done my
best; please hear me now.&quot;

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>How
long is it going to take God to free us from the unhealthy habit of thinking
only about ourselves? We must get to the point of being sick to death of
ourselves, until there is no longer any surprise at anything God might tell us
about ourselves. We cannot reach and understand the depths of our own
meagerness. There is only one place where we are right with God, and that is in
Christ Jesus. Once we are there, we have to pour out our lives for all we are
worth in this ministry of the inner life.
