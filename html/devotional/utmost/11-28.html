<b>The
Riches of the Destitute

</b><span>(Rom 3:24)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>The
gospel of the grace of God awakens an intense longing in human souls and an
equally intense resentment, because the truth that it reveals is not palatable
or easy to swallow. There is a certain pride in people that causes them to give
and give, but to come and accept a gift is another thing. I will give my life
to martyrdom; I will dedicate my life to service --- I will do anything. But do
not humiliate me to the level of the most hell-deserving sinner and tell me
that all I have to do is accept the gift of salvation through Jesus Christ.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>We
have to realize that we cannot earn or win anything from God through our own
efforts. We must either receive it as a gift or do without it. The greatest
spiritual blessing we receive is when we come to the knowledge that we are
destitute. Until we get there, our Lord is powerless. He can do nothing for us
as long as we think we are sufficient in and of ourselves. We must enter into
His kingdom through the door of destitution. As long as we are
&quot;rich,&quot; particularly in the area of pride or independence, God can do
nothing for us. It is only when we get hungry spiritually that we receive the
Holy Spirit. The gift of the essential nature of God is placed and made
effective in us by the Holy Spirit. He imparts to us the quickening life of
Jesus, making us truly alive. He takes that which was &quot;beyond&quot; us and
places it &quot;within&quot; us. And immediately, once &quot;the beyond&quot;
has come &quot;within,&quot; it rises up to &quot;the above,&quot; and we are lifted
into the kingdom where Jesus lives and reigns (Joh 3:5</span>).
