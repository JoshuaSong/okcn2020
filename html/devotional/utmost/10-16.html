<b>The
Key to the Master''s Orders

</b><span>(Mat 9:38)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>The
key to the missionary''s difficult task is in the hand of God, and that key is
prayer, not work --- that is, not work as the word is commonly used today,
which often results in the shifting of our focus away from God. The key to the
missionary''s difficult task is also not the key of common sense, nor is it the
key of medicine, civilization, education, or even evangelization. The key is in
following the Master''s orders --- the key is prayer. &quot;Pray the Lord of
the harvest . . . .&quot; In the natural realm, prayer is not practical but
absurd. We have to realize that prayer is foolish from the commonsense point of
view.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>From
Jesus Christ''s perspective, there are no nations, but only the <i>world.</i>
How many of us pray without regard to the persons, but with regard to only one
Person --- Jesus Christ? He owns the harvest that is produced through distress
and through conviction of sin. This is the harvest for which we have to pray
that laborers be sent out to reap. We stay busy at work, while people all
around us are ripe and ready to be harvested; we do not reap even one of them,
but simply waste our Lord''s time in over-energized activities and programs.
Suppose a crisis were to come into your father''s or your brother''s life ---
are you there as a laborer to reap the harvest for Jesus Christ? Is your
response, &quot;Oh, but I have a special work to do!&quot; No Christian has a
special work to do. A Christian is called to be Jesus Christ''s own, &quot;a
servant [who] is not greater than his master&quot; (Joh 13:16</span>),
and someone who does not dictate to Jesus Christ what he intends to do. Our
Lord calls us to no special work --- He calls us to Himself. &quot;Pray the
Lord of the harvest,&quot; and He will engineer your circumstances to send you
out as His laborer.
