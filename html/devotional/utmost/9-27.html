<b>The
&quot;Go&quot; of Renunciation

</b><span>(Luk 9:57)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Our
Lord''s attitude toward this man was one of severe discouragement, &quot;for He
knew what was in man&quot; (Joh 2:25</span>).
We would have said, &quot;I can''t imagine why He lost the opportunity of
winning that man! Imagine being so cold to him and turning him away so
discouraged!&quot; Never apologize for your Lord. The words of the Lord hurt
and offend until there is nothing left to be hurt or offended. Jesus Christ had
no tenderness whatsoever toward anything that was ultimately going to ruin a
person in his service to God. Our Lord''s answers were not based on some whim
or impulsive thought, but on the knowledge of &quot;what was in man.&quot; If
the Spirit of God brings to your mind a word of the Lord that hurts you, you
can be sure that there is something in you that He wants to hurt to the point
of its death.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>(<span
>Luk 9:58</span>). These words destroy the argument of
serving Jesus Christ because it is a pleasant thing to do. And the strictness
of the rejection that He demands of me allows for nothing to remain in my life
but my Lord, myself, and a sense of desperate hope. He says that I must let
everyone else come or go, and that I must be guided solely by my relationship
to Him. And He says, &quot;. . . the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His
head.&quot;

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&nbsp;(<span
>Luk 9:59</span>). This man did not want to disappoint
Jesus, nor did he want to show a lack of respect for his father. We put our
sense of loyalty to our relatives ahead of our loyalty to Jesus Christ, forcing
Him to take last place. When your loyalties conflict, always obey Jesus Christ
whatever the cost.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&nbsp;(<span
>Luk 9:61</span>). The person who says, &quot;Lord, I
will follow You, but . . .,&quot; is the person who is intensely ready to go,
but never goes. This man had reservations about going. The exacting call of
Jesus has no room for good-byes; good-byes, as we often use them, are pagan,
not Christian, because they divert us from the call. Once the call of God comes
to you, start going and never stop.
