<b>The
Way to Purity

</b><span>(Mat 15:18-20)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Initially
we trust in our ignorance, calling it innocence, and next we trust our
innocence, calling it purity. Then when we hear these strong statements from
our Lord, we shrink back, saying, &quot;But I never felt any of those awful
things in my heart.&quot; We resent what He reveals. Either Jesus Christ is the
supreme authority on the human heart, or He is not worth paying any attention
to. Am I prepared to trust the penetration of His Word into my heart, or would
I prefer to trust my own &quot;innocent ignorance&quot;? If I will take an
honest look at myself, becoming fully aware of my so-called innocence and
putting it to the test, I am very likely to have a rude awakening that what
Jesus Christ said is true, and I will be appalled at the possibilities of the
evil and the wrong within me. But as long as I remain under the false security
of my own &quot;innocence,&quot; I am living in a fool''s paradise. If I have
never been an openly rude and abusive person, the only reason is my own
cowardice coupled with the sense of protection I receive from living a
civilized life. But when I am open and completely exposed before God, I find
that Jesus Christ is right in His diagnosis of me.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
only thing that truly provides protection is the redemption of Jesus Christ. If
I will simply hand myself over to Him, I will never have to experience the
terrible possibilities that lie within my heart. Purity is something far too
deep for me to arrive at naturally. But when the Holy Spirit comes into me, He
brings into the center of my personal life the very Spirit that was exhibited
in the life of Jesus Christ, namely, the <i>Holy</i> Spirit, which is absolute
unblemished purity.
