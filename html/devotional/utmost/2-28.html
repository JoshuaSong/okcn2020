<b>What
Do You Want The Lord to Do for You?

</b><span>(Luk 18:41)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Is
there something in your life that not only disturbs you, but makes you a
disturbance to others? If so, it is always something you cannot handle
yourself. &quot;Then those who went before warned him that he should be quiet;
but he cried out all the more . . .&quot; (Luk 18:39</span>).
Be persistent with your disturbance until you get face to face with the Lord
Himself. Don''t deify common sense. To sit calmly by, instead of creating a
disturbance, serves only to deify our common sense. When Jesus asks what we
want Him to do for us about the incredible problem that is confronting us,
remember that He doesn''t work in commonsense ways, but only in supernatural
ways.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Look
at how we limit the Lord by only remembering what we have allowed Him to do for
us in the past. We say, &quot;I always failed there, and I always will.&quot;
Consequently, we don''t ask for what we want. Instead, we think, &quot;It is
ridiculous to ask God to do this.&quot; If it is an impossibility, it is the
very thing for which we have to ask. If it is not an impossible thing, it is
not a real disturbance. And God will do what is absolutely impossible.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>This
man received his sight. But the most impossible thing for you is to be so
closely identified with the Lord that there is literally nothing of your old
life remaining. God will do it if you will ask Him. But you have to come to the
point of believing Him to be almighty. We find faith by not only believing what
Jesus says, but, even more, by trusting Jesus Himself. If we only look at what
He says, we will never believe. Once we see Jesus, the impossible things He
does in our lives become as natural as breathing. The agony we suffer is only
the result of the deliberate shallowness of our own heart. We won''t believe;
we <i>won''t</i> let go by severing the line that secures the boat to the shore
--- we prefer to worry.
