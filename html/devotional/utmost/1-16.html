<b>The
Call of the Natural Life

</b><span>(Gal 1:15-16)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>&nbsp;The
call of God is not a call to serve Him in any particular way. My contact with
the nature of God will shape my understanding of His call and will help me
realize what I truly desire to do for Him. The call of God is an expression of
His nature; the service which results in my life is suited to me and is an
expression of my nature. The call of the natural life was stated by the apostle
Paul --- &quot;When it pleased God . . . to reveal His Son in me, that I might <i>preach</i>
Him [that is, <i>purely and solemnly express</i> Him] among the Gentiles . . .
.&quot;

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Service
is the overflow which pours from a life filled with love and devotion. But
strictly speaking, there is no <i>call</i> to that. Service is what I bring to
the relationship and is the reflection of my identification with the nature of
God. Service becomes a natural part of my life. God brings me into the proper
relationship with Himself so that I can understand His call, and then I serve
Him on my own out of a motivation of absolute love. Service to God is the
deliberate love-gift of a nature that has heard the call of God. Service is an
expression of my nature, and God''s call is an expression of His nature.
Therefore, when I receive His nature and hear His call, His divine voice
resounds throughout His nature and mine and the two become one in service. The
Son of God reveals Himself in me, and out of devotion to Him service becomes my
everyday way of life.
