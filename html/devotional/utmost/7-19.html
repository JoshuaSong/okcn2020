<b>The
Submission of the Believer

</b><span>(Joh 13:13)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Our
Lord never insists on having authority over us. He never says, &quot;You <i>will</i>
submit to me.&quot; No, He leaves us perfectly free to choose --- so free, in
fact, that we can spit in His face or we can put Him to death, as others have
done; and yet He will never say a word. But once His life has been created in
me through His redemption, I instantly recognize His right to absolute
authority over me. It is a complete and effective domination, in which I
acknowledge that &quot;You are <i>worthy,</i> O Lord . . .&quot; (<span
>Rev 4:11</span>). It is simply the unworthiness within
me that refuses to bow down or to submit to one who is worthy. When I meet
someone who is more holy than myself, and I don''t recognize his worthiness,
nor obey his instructions for me, it is a sign of my own unworthiness being
revealed. God teaches us by using these people who are a little better than we
are; not better intellectually, but more holy. And He continues to do so until
we willingly submit. Then the whole attitude of our life is one of obedience to
Him.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>If
our Lord insisted on our obedience, He would simply become a taskmaster and cease
to have any real authority. He never insists on obedience, but when we truly
see Him we will instantly obey Him. Then He is easily Lord of our life, and we
live in adoration of Him from morning till night. The level of my growth in
grace is revealed by the way I look at obedience. We should have a much higher
view of the word <i>obedience,</i> rescuing it from the mire of the world.
Obedience is only possible between people who are equals in their relationship
to each other; like the relationship between father and son, not that between
master and servant. Jesus showed this relationship by saying, &quot;I and My
Father are one&quot; (Joh 10:30</span>).
&quot;. . . though He was a Son, yet He learned obedience by the things which
He suffered&quot; (Heb 5:8</span>). The Son
was obedient as our Redeemer, <i>because He was the Son,</i> not in order to
become God''s Son.
