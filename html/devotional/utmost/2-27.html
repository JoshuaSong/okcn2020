<b>&quot;Do
You Now Believe?&quot;

</b><span>(Joh 16:30-31)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Now
we believe. . . .&quot; But Jesus asks, &quot;Do you . . . ? Indeed the hour is
coming . . . that you . . . will leave Me alone&quot; (<span
>Joh 16:31-32</span>). Many Christian workers have left
Jesus Christ alone and yet tried to serve Him out of a sense of duty, or
because they sense a need as a result of their own discernment. The reason for
this is actually the absence of the resurrection life of Jesus. Our soul has
gotten out of intimate contact with God by leaning on our own religious
understanding (Pro 3:5-6</span>). This is not
deliberate sin and there is no punishment attached to it. But once a person
realizes how he has hindered his understanding of Jesus Christ, and caused
uncertainties, sorrows, and difficulties for himself, it is with shame and
remorse that he has to return.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>We
need to rely on the resurrection life of Jesus on a much deeper level than we
do now. We should get in the habit of continually seeking His counsel on
everything, instead of making our own commonsense decisions and then asking Him
to bless them. He cannot bless them; it is not in His realm to do so, and those
decisions are severed from reality. If we do something simply out of a sense of
duty, we are trying to live up to a standard that competes with Jesus Christ.
We become a prideful, arrogant person, thinking we know what to do in every
situation. We have put our sense of duty on the throne of our life, instead of
enthroning the resurrection life of Jesus. We are not told to &quot;walk in the
light&quot; of our conscience or in the light of a sense of duty, but to
&quot;walk in the light <i>as He is in the light</i> . . .&quot; (<span
>1Jo 1:7</span>). When we do something out of a sense of
duty, it is easy to explain the reasons for our actions to others. But when we
do something out of obedience to the Lord, there can be no other explanation
--- just obedience. That is why a saint can be so easily ridiculed and
misunderstood.
