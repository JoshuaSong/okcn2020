<b>Yesterday

</b><span>(Isa 52:12)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/><b>Security
from Yesterday.</b>
&quot;. . . God requires an account of what is past&quot; (<span
>Ecc 3:15</span>). At the end of the year we turn with
eagerness to all that God has for the future, and yet anxiety is apt to arise
when we remember our yesterdays. Our present enjoyment of God''s grace tends to
be lessened by the memory of yesterday''s sins and blunders. But God is the God
of our yesterdays, and He allows the memory of them to turn the past into a
ministry of spiritual growth for our future. God reminds us of the past to
protect us from a very shallow security in the present.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/><b>Security
for Tomorrow.</b>
&quot;. . . the Lord will go before you . . . .&quot; This is a gracious
revelation --- that God will send His forces out where we have failed to do so.
He will keep watch so that we will not be tripped up again by the same
failures, as would undoubtedly happen if He were not our &quot;rear
guard.&quot; And God''s hand reaches back to the past, settling all the claims against
our conscience.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/><b>Security
for Today.</b>
&quot;You shall not go out with haste . . . .&quot; As we go forth into the
coming year, let it not be in the haste of impetuous, forgetful delight, nor
with the quickness of impulsive thoughtlessness. But let us go out with the
patient power of knowing that the God of Israel will go before us. Our
yesterdays hold broken and irreversible things for us. It is true that we have
lost opportunities that will never return, but God can transform this
destructive anxiety into a constructive thoughtfulness for the future. Let the
past rest, but let it rest in the sweet embrace of Christ.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Leave
the broken, irreversible past in His hands, and step out into the invincible
future with Him.
