<b>The
Concentration of Personal Sin

</b><span>(Isa 6:5)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>When
I come into the very presence of God, I do not realize that I am a sinner in an
indefinite sense, but I suddenly realize and the focus of my attention is
directed toward the concentration of sin in a particular area of my life. A
person will easily say, &quot;Oh yes, I know I am a sinner,&quot; but when he
comes into the presence of God he cannot get away with such a broad and
indefinite statement. Our conviction is focused on our specific sin, and we
realize, as Isaiah did, what we really are. This is always the sign that a
person is in the presence of God. There is never any vague sense of sin, but a
focusing on the concentration of sin in some specific, personal area of life.
God begins by convicting us of the very thing to which His Spirit has directed
our mind''s attention. If we will surrender, submitting to His conviction of
that particular sin, He will lead us down to where He can reveal the vast
underlying nature of sin. That is the way God always deals with us when we are
consciously aware of His presence.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>This
experience of our attention being directed to our concentration of personal sin
is true in everyone''s life, from the greatest of saints to the worst of
sinners. When a person first begins climbing the ladder of experience, he might
say, &quot;I don''t know where I''ve gone wrong,&quot; but the Spirit of God
will point out some definite and specific thing to him. The effect of Isaiah''s
vision of the holiness of the Lord was the directing of his attention to the
fact that he was &quot;a man of unclean lips.&quot; &quot;He touched my mouth
with it, and said: ''Behold, this has touched your lips; your iniquity is taken
away, and your sin purged'' &quot; (Isa 6:7</span>).
The cleansing fire had to be applied where the sin had been concentrated.
