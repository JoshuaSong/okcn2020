<b>The
Supremacy of Jesus Christ

</b><span>(Joh 16:14)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>The
holiness movements of today have none of the rugged reality of the New
Testament about them. There is nothing about them that needs the death of Jesus
Christ. All that is required is a pious atmosphere, prayer, and devotion. This
type of experience is not supernatural nor miraculous. It did not cost the
sufferings of God, nor is it stained with &quot;the blood of the Lamb&quot; (<span
>Rev 12:11</span>). It is not marked or sealed by the
Holy Spirit as being genuine, and it has no visual sign that causes people to
exclaim with awe and wonder, &quot;That is the work of God Almighty!&quot; Yet
the New Testament is about the work of God and nothing else.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
New Testament example of the Christian experience is that of a personal,
passionate devotion to the Person of Jesus Christ. Every other kind of
so-called Christian experience is detached from the Person of Jesus. There is
no regeneration --- no being born again into the kingdom in which Christ lives
and reigns supreme. There is only the idea that He is our pattern. In the New
Testament Jesus Christ is the Savior long before He is the pattern. Today He is
being portrayed as the figurehead of a religion --- a mere example. He is that,
but He is infinitely more. He is salvation itself; He <i>is</i> the gospel of
God!

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Jesus
said, &quot;. . . when He, the Spirit of truth, has come, . . . He will glorify
Me . . .&quot; (Joh 16:13-14</span>). When I
commit myself to the revealed truth of the New Testament, I receive from God
the gift of the Holy Spirit, who then begins interpreting to me what Jesus did.
The Spirit of God does in me internally all that Jesus Christ did for me
externally.
