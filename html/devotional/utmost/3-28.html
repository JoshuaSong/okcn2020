<b>Isn''t
There Some Misunderstanding?

</b><span>(Joh 11:7-8)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Just
because I don''t understand what Jesus Christ says, I have no right to
determine that He must be mistaken in what He says. That is a dangerous view,
and it is never right to think that my obedience to God''s directive will bring
dishonor to Jesus. The only thing that will bring dishonor is not obeying Him.
To put my view of His honor ahead of what He is plainly guiding me to do is
never right, even though it may come from a real desire to prevent Him from
being put to an open shame. I know when the instructions have come from God
because of their quiet persistence. But when I begin to weigh the <i>pros</i>
and <i>cons,</i> and doubt and debate enter into my mind, I am bringing in an
element that is not of God. This will only result in my concluding that His
instructions to me were not right. Many of us are faithful to our ideas about
Jesus Christ, but how many of us are faithful to Jesus Himself? Faithfulness to
Jesus means that I must step out even when and where I can''t see anything (<span
>Mat 14:29</span>). But faithfulness to my own ideas
means that I first clear the way mentally. Faith, however, is not intellectual
understanding; faith is a deliberate commitment to the Person of Jesus Christ,
even when I can''t see the way ahead.

<br/>Are
you debating whether you should take a step of faith in Jesus, or whether you
should wait until you can clearly see how to do what He has asked? Simply obey
Him with unrestrained joy. When He tells you something and you begin to debate,
it is because you have a misunderstanding of what honors Him and what doesn''t.
Are you faithful to Jesus, or faithful to your ideas about Him? Are you
faithful to what He says, or are you trying to compromise His words with
thoughts that never came from Him? &quot;Whatever He says to you, <i>do
it&quot;</i> (Joh 2:5</span>).
