<b>Are
You Exhausted Spiritually?

</b><span>(Isa 40:28)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Exhaustion
means that our vital energies are completely worn out and spent. Spiritual
exhaustion is never the result of sin, but of service. Whether or not you
experience exhaustion will depend on where you get your supplies. Jesus said to
Peter, &quot;Feed My sheep,&quot; but He gave him nothing with which to feed
them (Joh 21:17</span>). The process of being
made broken bread and poured-out wine means that <i>you</i> have to be the
nourishment for other people''s souls until they learn to feed on God. They
must drain you completely --- to the very last drop. But be careful to
replenish your supply, or you will quickly be utterly exhausted. Until others
learn to draw on the life of the Lord Jesus directly, they will have to draw on
His life through you. You must literally be their source of supply, until they
learn to take their nourishment from God. We owe it to God to be our best for
His lambs and sheep, as well as for Him.

<br/>Have
you delivered yourself over to exhaustion because of the way you have been
serving God? If so, then renew and rekindle your desires and affections.
Examine your reasons for service. Is your source based on your own
understanding or is it grounded on the redemption of Jesus Christ? Continually
look back to the foundation of your love and affection and remember where your
Source of power lies. You have no right to complain, &quot;O Lord, I am so
exhausted.&quot; He saved and sanctified you to exhaust you. Be exhausted for
God, but remember that He is your supply. &quot;All my springs are in you&quot;
(Psa 87:7</span>).
