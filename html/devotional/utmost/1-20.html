<b>Recall
What God Remembers

</b><span>(Jer 2:2)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>&nbsp;Am
I as spontaneously kind to God as I used to be, or am I only expecting God to
be kind to me? Does everything in my life fill His heart with gladness, or do I
constantly complain because things don''t seem to be going my way? A person who
has forgotten what God treasures will not be filled with joy. It is wonderful
to remember that Jesus Christ has needs which we can meet --- &quot;Give Me a
drink&quot; (Joh 4:7</span>). How much
kindness have I shown Him in the past week? Has my life been a good reflection
on His reputation?

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>God
is saying to His people, &quot;You are not in love with Me now, but I remember
a time when you were.&quot; He says, &quot;I remember . . . the love of your
betrothal . . .&quot; (Jer 2:2</span>). Am I
as filled to overflowing with love for Jesus Christ as I was in the beginning,
when I went out of my way to prove my devotion to Him? Does He ever find me
pondering the time when I cared only for Him? Is that where I am now, or have I
chosen man''s wisdom over true love for Him? Am I so in love with Him that I
take no thought for where He might lead me? Or am I watching to see how much
respect I get as I measure how much service I should give Him?

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>As
I recall what God remembers about me, I may also begin to realize that He is
not what He used to be to me. When this happens, I should allow the shame and
humiliation it creates in my life, because it will bring godly sorrow, and
&quot;godly sorrow produces repentance . . .&quot; (2Co 7:10</span>).
