<b>The
Price of the Vision

</b><span>(Isa 6:1)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Our
soul''s personal history with God is often an account of the death of our
heroes. Over and over again God has to remove our friends to put Himself in
their place, and that is when we falter, fail, and become discouraged. Let me
think about this personally --- when the person died who represented for me all
that God was, did I give up on everything in life? Did I become ill or
disheartened? Or did I do as Isaiah did and see the Lord?

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>My
vision of God is dependent upon the condition of my character. My character
determines whether or not truth can even be revealed to me. Before I can say,
&quot;I saw the Lord,&quot; there must be something in my character that
conforms to the likeness of God. Until I am born again and really begin to see
the kingdom of God, I only see from the perspective of my own biases. What I
need is God''s surgical procedure --- His use of external circumstances to
bring about internal purification.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Your
priorities must be God first, God second, and God third, until your life is
continually face to face with God and no one else is taken into account
whatsoever. Your prayer will then be, &quot;In all the world there is no one
but You, dear God; there is no one but You.&quot;

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Keep
paying the price. Let God see that you are willing to live up to the vision.
