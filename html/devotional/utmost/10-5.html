<b>The
Nature of Degeneration

</b><span>(Rom 5:12)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>The
Bible does not say that God punished the human race for one man''s sin, but
that the nature of sin, namely, my claim to my right to myself, entered into
the human race through one man. But it also says that another Man took upon
Himself the sin of the human race and put it away --- an infinitely more
profound revelation (Heb 9:26</span>). The
nature of sin is not immorality and wrongdoing, but the nature of
self-realization which leads us to say, &quot;I am my own god.&quot; This
nature may exhibit itself in proper morality or in improper immorality, but it
always has a common basis --- my claim to my right to myself. When our Lord
faced either people with all the forces of evil in them, or people who were
clean-living, moral, and upright, He paid no attention to the moral degradation
of one, nor any attention to the moral attainment of the other. He looked at
something we do not see, namely, the nature of man (Joh 2:25</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Sin
is something I am born with and cannot touch --- only God touches sin through
redemption. It is through the Cross of Christ that God redeemed the entire
human race from the possibility of damnation through the heredity of sin. God
nowhere holds a person responsible for having the heredity of sin, and does not
condemn anyone because of it. Condemnation comes when I realize that Jesus
Christ came to deliver me from this heredity of sin, and yet I refuse to let
Him do so. From that moment I begin to get the seal of damnation. &quot;This is
the condemnation [and the critical moment], that the light has come into the
world, and men loved darkness rather than light . . . &quot; (<span
>Joh 3:19</span>).
