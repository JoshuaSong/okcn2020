<b>Have
You Seen Jesus?

</b><span>(Mar 16:12)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Being
saved and seeing Jesus are not the same thing. Many people who have never seen
Jesus have received and share in God''s grace. But once you have seen Him, you
can never be the same. Other things will not have the appeal they did before.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>You
should always recognize the difference between what you see Jesus to be and
what He has done for you. If you see only what He has done for you, your God is
not big enough. But if you have had a vision, seeing Jesus as He really is,
experiences can come and go, yet you will endure &quot;as seeing Him who is
invisible&quot; (Heb 11:27</span>). The man
who was blind from birth did not know who Jesus was until Christ appeared and
revealed Himself to him (see John 9). Jesus appears to those for whom He has
done something, but we cannot order or predict when He will come. He may appear
suddenly, at any turn. Then you can exclaim, &quot;Now I see Him!&quot; (<span
>Joh 9:25</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Jesus
must appear to you and to your friend individually; no one can see Jesus with
your eyes. And division takes place when one has seen Him and the other has
not. You cannot bring your friend to the point of seeing; God must do it. Have
you seen Jesus? If so, you will want others to see Him too. &quot;And they went
and told it to the rest, but they did not believe them either&quot; (<span
>Mar 16:13</span>). When you see Him, you must tell,
even if they don''t believe.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>O
could I tell, you surely would believe it!

<br/>O
could I only say what I have seen!

<br/>How
should I tell or how can you receive it,

<br/>How,
till He bringeth you where I have been?
