<b>Receiving
Yourself in the Fires of Sorrow

</b><span>(Joh 12:27-28)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>As
a saint of God, my attitude toward sorrow and difficulty should not be to ask
that they be prevented, but to ask that God protect me so that I may remain
what He created me to be, in spite of all my fires of sorrow. Our Lord received
Himself, accepting His position and realizing His purpose, in the midst of the
fire of sorrow. He was saved not <i>from</i> the hour, but <i>out of</i> the
hour.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>We
say that there ought to be no sorrow, but there is sorrow, and we have to
accept and receive ourselves in its fires. If we try to evade sorrow, refusing
to deal with it, we are foolish. Sorrow is one of the biggest facts in life,
and there is no use in saying it should not be. Sin, sorrow, and suffering <i>are,</i>
and it is not for us to say that God has made a mistake in allowing them.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Sorrow
removes a great deal of a person''s shallowness, but it does not always make
that person better. Suffering either gives me to myself or it destroys me. You
cannot find or receive yourself through success, because you lose your head
over pride. And you cannot receive yourself through the monotony of your daily
life, because you give in to complaining. The only way to find yourself is in
the fires of sorrow. Why it should be this way is immaterial. The fact is that
it is true in the Scriptures and in human experience. You can always recognize
who has been through the fires of sorrow and received himself, and you know
that you can go to him in your moment of trouble and find that he has plenty of
time for you. But if a person has not been through the fires of sorrow, he is
apt to be contemptuous, having no respect or time for you, only turning you
away. If you will receive yourself in the fires of sorrow, God will make you
nourishment for other people.
