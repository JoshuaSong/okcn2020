<b>Are
You Ready To Be Poured Out As an Offering?

</b><span>(2Ti 4:6)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Are
you ready to be poured out as an offering? It is an act of your will, not your
emotions. <i>Tell</i> God you are ready to be offered as a sacrifice for Him.
Then accept the consequences as they come, without any complaints, in spite of
what God may send your way. God sends you through a crisis in private, where no
other person can help you. From the outside your life may appear to be the
same, but the difference is taking place in your will. Once you have
experienced the crisis in your will, you will take no thought of the cost when
it begins to affect you externally. If you don''t deal with God on the level of
your will first, the result will be only to arouse sympathy for yourself.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;Bind
the sacrifice with cords to the horns of the altar&quot; (<span
>Psa 118:27</span>). You must be willing to be placed on
the altar and go through the fire; willing to experience what the altar
represents --- burning, purification, and separation for only one purpose ---
the elimination of every desire and affection not grounded in or directed
toward God. But <i>you</i> don''t eliminate it, God does. You &quot;bind the
sacrifice . . . to the horns of the altar&quot; and see to it that you don''t
wallow in self-pity once the fire begins. After you have gone through the fire,
there will be nothing that will be able to trouble or depress you. When another
crisis arises, you will realize that things cannot touch you as they used to
do. What fire lies ahead in your life?

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Tell
God you are ready to be poured out as an offering, and God will prove Himself
to be all you ever dreamed He would be.
