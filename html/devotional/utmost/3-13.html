<b>God''s
Total Surrender to Us

</b><span>(Joh 3:16)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Salvation
does not mean merely deliverance from sin or the experience of personal
holiness. The salvation which comes from God means being completely delivered
from myself, and being placed into perfect union with Him. When I think of my
salvation experience, I think of being delivered from sin and gaining personal
holiness. But salvation is so much more! It means that the Spirit of God has
brought me into intimate contact with the true Person of God Himself. And as I
am caught up into total surrender to God, I become thrilled with something
infinitely greater than myself.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>To
say that we are called to preach holiness or sanctification is to miss the main
point. We are called to proclaim Jesus Christ (1Co 2:2</span>).
The fact that He saves from sin and makes us holy is actually part of the
effect of His wonderful and total surrender to us.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>If
we are truly surrendered, we will never be aware of our own efforts to remain
surrendered. Our entire life will be consumed with the One to whom we
surrender. Beware of talking about surrender if you know nothing about it. In
fact, you will never know anything about it until you understand that (<span
>Joh 3:16</span>) means that God completely and
absolutely gave Himself to us. In our surrender, we must give ourselves to God
in the same way He gave Himself for us --- totally, unconditionally, and
without reservation. The consequences and circumstances resulting from our
surrender will never even enter our mind, because our life will be totally
consumed with Him.
