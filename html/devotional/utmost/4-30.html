<b>Spontaneous
Love

</b><span>(1Co 13:4)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Love
is not premeditated --- it is spontaneous; that is, it bursts forth in
extraordinary ways. There is nothing of precise certainty in Paul''s
description of love. We cannot predetermine our thoughts and actions by saying,
&quot;Now I will never think any evil thoughts, and I will believe everything
that Jesus would have me to believe.&quot; No, the characteristic of love is
spontaneity. We don''t deliberately set the statements of Jesus before us as
our standard, but when His Spirit is having His way with us, we live according
to His standard without even realizing it. And when we look back, we are amazed
at how unconcerned we have been over our emotions, which is the very evidence
that real spontaneous love was there. The nature of everything involved in the
life of God in us is only discerned when we have been through it and it is in
our past.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
fountains from which love flows are in God, not in us. It is absurd to think
that the love of God is naturally in our hearts, as a result of our own nature.
His love is there only because it &quot;has been poured out in our hearts by
the Holy Spirit . . .&quot; (Rom 5:5</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>If
we try to prove to God how much we love Him, it is a sure sign that we really
don''t love Him. The evidence of our love for Him is the absolute spontaneity of
our love, which flows naturally from His nature within us. And when we look
back, we will not be able to determine why we did certain things, but we can
know that we did them according to the spontaneous nature of His love in us.
The life of God exhibits itself in this spontaneous way because the fountains
of His love are in the Holy Spirit.
