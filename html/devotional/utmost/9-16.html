<b>Praying
to God in Secret

</b><span>(Mat 6:6)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>The
primary thought in the area of religion is --- keep your eyes on God, not on
people. Your motivation should not be the desire to be known as a praying
person. Find an inner room in which to pray where no one even knows you are
praying, shut the door, and talk to God in secret. Have no motivation other
than to know your Father in heaven. It is impossible to carry on your life as a
disciple without definite times of secret prayer.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;When
you pray, do not use vain repetitions . . .&quot; (Mat 6:7</span>).
God does not hear us because we pray earnestly --- He hears us solely on the
basis of redemption. God is never impressed by our earnestness. Prayer is not
simply getting things from God --- that is only the most elementary kind of
prayer. Prayer is coming into perfect fellowship and oneness with God. If the
Son of God has been formed in us through regeneration (<span
>Gal 4:19</span>), then He will continue to press on
beyond our common sense and will change our attitude about the things for which
we pray.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;Everyone
who <i>asks</i> receives . . .&quot; (Mat 7:8</span>).
We pray religious nonsense without even involving our will, and then we say
that God did not answer --- but in reality we have never <i>asked</i> for
anything. Jesus said, &quot;. . . you will ask what you <i>desire</i> . .
.&quot; (Joh 15:7</span>). Asking means that
our will must be involved. Whenever Jesus talked about prayer, He spoke with
wonderful childlike simplicity. Then we respond with our critical attitude,
saying, &quot;Yes, but even Jesus said that we must <i>ask.&quot;</i> But
remember that we have to ask things of God that are in keeping with the God
whom Jesus Christ revealed.
