<b>The
Overshadowing of God''s Personal Deliverance

</b><span>(Jer 1:8)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>God
promised Jeremiah that He would deliver him personally --- &quot;. . . your
life shall be as a prize to you . . .&quot; (Jer 39:18</span>).
That is all God promises His children. Wherever God sends us, He will guard our
lives. Our personal property and possessions are to be a matter of indifference
to us, and our hold on these things should be very loose. If this is not the
case, we will have panic, heartache, and distress. Having the proper outlook is
evidence of the deeply rooted belief in the overshadowing of God''s personal
deliverance.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
Sermon on the Mount indicates that when we are on a mission for Jesus Christ,
there is no time to stand up for ourselves. Jesus says, in effect, &quot;Don''t
worry about whether or not you are being treated justly.&quot; Looking for
justice is actually a sign that we have been diverted from our devotion to Him.
Never look for justice in this world, but never cease to give it. If we look
for justice, we will only begin to complain and to indulge ourselves in the
discontent of self-pity, as if to say, &quot;Why should I be treated like
this?&quot; If we are devoted to Jesus Christ, we have nothing to do with what
we encounter, whether it is just or unjust. In essence, Jesus says,
&quot;Continue steadily on with what I have told you to do, and I will guard
your life. If you try to guard it yourself, you remove yourself from My
deliverance.&quot; Even the most devout among us become atheistic in this
regard --- we do not believe Him. We put our common sense on the throne and
then attach God''s name to it. We <i>do</i> lean to our own understanding,
instead of trusting God with all our hearts (Pro 3:5-6</span>).
