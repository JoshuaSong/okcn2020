<b>Wrestling
Before God

</b><span>(Eph 6:13,18)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>You
must learn to wrestle <i>against</i> the things that hinder your communication
with God, and wrestle in prayer <i>for</i> other people; but to wrestle <i>with</i>
God in prayer is unscriptural. If you ever do wrestle with God, you will be
crippled for the rest of your life. If you grab hold of God and wrestle with
Him, as Jacob did, simply because He is working in a way that doesn''t meet
with your approval, you force Him to put you out of joint (<span
>Gen 32:24-25</span>). Don''t become a cripple by
wrestling with the ways of God, but be someone who wrestles before God with the
things of this world, because &quot;we are more than conquerors through Him . .
.&quot; (Rom 8:37</span>). Wrestling before
God makes an impact in His kingdom. If you ask me to pray for you, and I am not
complete in Christ, my prayer accomplishes nothing. But if I am complete in
Christ, my prayer brings victory all the time. Prayer is effective only when
there is completeness ---&quot;take up the whole armor of God . . . .&quot;

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Always
make a distinction between God''s perfect will and His permissive will, which
He uses to accomplish His divine purpose for our lives. God''s perfect will is
unchangeable. It is with His permissive will, or the various things that He
allows into our lives, that we must wrestle before Him. It is our reaction to
these things allowed by His permissive will that enables us to come to the
point of seeing His perfect will for us. &quot;We know that all things work
together for good to those who love God . . .&quot; (<span style='color:
black'>Rom 8:28</span>) --- to those who remain true to God''s perfect
willHis calling in Christ Jesus. God''s permissive will is the testing He uses
to reveal His true sons and daughters. We should not be spineless and
automatically say, &quot;Yes, it is the Lord''s will.&quot; We don''t have to
fight or wrestle <i>with God,</i> but we must wrestle before God <i>with
things.</i> Beware of lazily giving up. Instead, put up a glorious fight and
you will find yourself empowered with His strength.
