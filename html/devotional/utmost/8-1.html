<b>Learning
About His Ways

</b><span>(Mat 11:1)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/><b>He
comes where He commands us to leave.</b><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:"Trebuchet MS","sans-serif"'> If you stayed home when God
told you to go because you were so concerned about your own people there, then
you actually robbed them of the teaching of Jesus Christ Himself. When you
obeyed and left all the consequences to God, the Lord went into your city to
teach, but as long as you were disobedient, you blocked His way. Watch where
you begin to debate with Him and put what you call your duty into competition
with His commands. If you say, &quot;I know that He told me to go, but my duty
is here,&quot; it simply means that you do not believe that Jesus means what He
says.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/><b>He
teaches where He instructs us not to teach.</b>

<br/>&quot;Master
. . . let us make three tabernacles . . .&quot; (Luk 9:33</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Are
we playing the part of an amateur providence, trying to play God''s role in the
lives of others? Are we so noisy in our instruction of other people that God
cannot get near them? We must learn to keep our mouths shut and our spirits
alert. God wants to instruct us regarding His Son, and He wants to turn our
times of prayer into mounts of transfiguration. When we become certain that God
is going to work in a particular way, He will never work in that way again.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/><b>He
works where He sends us to wait.</b>

<br/>&quot;.
. . tarry . . . until . . .&quot; (Luk 24:49</span>).


<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;Wait
on the Lord&quot; and He will work (Psa 37:34</span>).
But don''t wait sulking spiritually and feeling sorry for yourself, just
because you can''t see one inch in front of you! Are we detached enough from
our own spiritual fits of emotion to &quot;wait patiently for Him&quot;? (<span
>Psa 37:7</span>). Waiting is not sitting with folded
hands doing nothing, but it is learning to do what we are told.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>These
are some of the facets of His ways that we rarely recognize.
