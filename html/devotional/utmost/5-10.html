<b>Take
the Initiative

</b><span>(2Pe 1:5)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/><i>Add</i><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Trebuchet MS","sans-serif"'> means that we have
to do something. We are in danger of forgetting that we cannot do what God
does, and that God will not do what we can do. We cannot save nor sanctify
ourselves --- God does that. But God will not give us good habits or character,
and He will not force us to walk correctly before Him. We have to do all that
ourselves. We must &quot;work <i>out&quot;</i> our &quot;own salvation&quot;
which God has worked <i>in</i> us (Phi 2:12</span>).
<i>Add</i> means that we must get into the habit of doing things, and in the
initial stages that is difficult. To take the initiative is to make a beginning
--- to instruct yourself in the way you must go.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Beware
of the tendency to ask the way when you know it perfectly well. Take the
initiative --- stop hesitating --- take the first step. Be determined to act
immediately in faith on what God says to you when He speaks, and never
reconsider or change your initial decisions. If you hesitate when God tells you
to do something, you are being careless, spurning the grace in which you stand.
Take the initiative yourself, make a decision of your will right now, and make
it impossible to go back. Burn your bridges behind you, saying, &quot;I <i>will</i>
write that letter,&quot; or &quot;I <i>will</i> pay that debt&quot;; and then
do it! Make it irrevocable.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>We
have to get into the habit of carefully listening to God about everything,
forming the habit of finding out what He says and heeding it. If, when a crisis
comes, we instinctively turn to God, we will know that the habit has been
formed in us. We have to take the initiative where we <i>are,</i> not where we
have not yet been.
