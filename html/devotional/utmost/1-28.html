<b>How
Could Someone Be So Ignorant!

</b><span>(Act 26:15)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;The
Lord spoke thus to me with a strong hand . . .&quot; (<span
>Isa 8:11</span>). There is no escape when our Lord
speaks. He always comes using His authority and taking hold of our
understanding. Has the voice of God come to you directly? If it has, you cannot
mistake the intimate insistence with which it has spoken to you. God speaks in
the language you know best --- not through your ears, but through your
circumstances.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>God
has to destroy our determined confidence in our own convictions. We say,
&quot;I know that this is what I should do&quot; --- and suddenly the voice of
God speaks in a way that overwhelms us by revealing the depths of our
ignorance. We show our ignorance of Him in the very way we decide to serve Him.
We serve Jesus in a spirit that is not His, and hurt Him by our defense of Him.
We push His claims in the spirit of the devil; our words sound all right, but
the spirit is that of an enemy. &quot;He . . . rebuked them, and said, ''You do
not know what manner of spirit you are of'' &quot; (Luk 9:55</span>).
The spirit of our Lord in His followers is described in 1 Corinthians 13.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Have
I been persecuting Jesus by an eager determination to serve Him in my own way?
If I feel I have done my duty, yet have hurt Him in the process, I can be sure
that this was not my duty. My way will not be to foster a meek and quiet
spirit, only the spirit of self-satisfaction. We presume that whatever is
unpleasant is our duty! Is that anything like the spirit of our Lord ---
&quot;I <i>delight</i> to do Your will, O my God . . .&quot; (<span
>Psa 40:8</span>).
