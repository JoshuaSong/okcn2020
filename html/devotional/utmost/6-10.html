<b>And
After That What''s Next To Do?

</b><span>(Luk 11:9)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/><b>Seek
if you have not found.</b>
&quot;You ask and do not receive, because you ask amiss . . .&quot; (<span
>Jam 4:3</span>). If you ask for things from life
instead of from God, &quot;you ask amiss&quot;; that is, you ask out of your
desire for self-fulfillment. The more you fulfill yourself the less you will
seek God. &quot;. . . seek, and you will find . . . .&quot; Get to work ---
narrow your focus and interests to this one thing. Have you ever sought God
with your whole heart, or have you simply given Him a feeble cry after some
emotionally painful experience? &quot;. . . seek, [focus,] and you will find .
. . .&quot;

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;Ho!
Everyone who thirsts, come to the waters. . .&quot; (<span style='color:
black'>Isa 55:1</span>). Are you thirsty, or complacent and indifferent ---
so satisfied with your own experience that you want nothing more of God?
Experience is a doorway, not a final goal. Beware of building your faith on
experience, or your life will not ring true and will only sound the note of a
critical spirit. Remember that you can never give another person what you have
found, but you can cause him to have a desire for it.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;.
. . knock, and it will be opened to you&quot; (Luk 11:9</span>).
&quot;Draw near to God . . .&quot; (Jam 4:8</span>).
Knock --- the door is closed, and your heartbeat races as you knock.
&quot;Cleanse your hands . . .&quot; (Jam 4:8</span>).
Knock a bit louder --- you begin to find that you are dirty. &quot;. . . purify
your hearts . . .&quot; (Jam 4:8</span>). It
is becoming even more personal --- you are desperate and serious now --- you
will do anything. &quot;Lament . . . &quot; (Jam 4:9</span>).
Have you ever lamented, expressing your sorrow before God for the condition of
your inner life? There is no thread of self-pity left, only the heart-rending
difficulty and amazement which comes from seeing what kind of person you really
are. &quot;Humble yourselves . . . &quot; (Jam 4:10</span>).
It is a humbling experience to knock at God''s door --- you have to knock with
the crucified thief. &quot;. . . to him who knocks <i>it will be opened&quot;</i>
(Luk 11:10</span>).
