<b>The
Piercing Question

</b><span>(Joh 21:17)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Peter''s
response to this piercing question is considerably different from the bold
defiance he exhibited only a few days before when he declared, &quot;Even if I
have to die with You, I will not deny You!&quot; (Mat 26:33-35</span>).
Our natural individuality, or our natural self, boldly speaks out and declares
its feelings. But the true love within our inner spiritual self can be
discovered only by experiencing the hurt of this question of Jesus Christ.
Peter loved Jesus in the way any natural man loves a good person. Yet that is
nothing but emotional love. It may reach deeply into our natural self, but it
never penetrates to the spirit of a person. True love never simply declares
itself. Jesus said, &quot;Whoever <i>confesses</i> Me before men [that is,
confesses his love by everything he does, not merely by his words], him the Son
of Man also will confess before the angels of God&quot; (<span
>Luk 12:8</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Unless
we are experiencing the hurt of facing every deception about ourselves, we have
hindered the work of the Word of God in our lives. The Word of God inflicts
hurt on us more than sin ever could, because sin dulls our senses. But this
question of the Lord intensifies our sensitivities to the point that this hurt
produced by Jesus is the most exquisite pain conceivable. It hurts not only on
the natural level, but also on the deeper spiritual level. &quot;For the Word of
God is living and powerful . . . , piercing even to the division of soul and
spirit . . .&quot; --- to the point that no deception can remain (<span
>Heb 4:12</span>). When the Lord asks us this question,
it is impossible to think and respond properly, because when the Lord speaks
directly to us, the pain is too intense. It causes such a tremendous hurt that
any part of our life which may be out of line with His will can feel the pain.
There is never any mistaking the pain of the Lord''s Word by His children, but
the moment that pain is felt is the very moment at which God reveals His truth
to us.
