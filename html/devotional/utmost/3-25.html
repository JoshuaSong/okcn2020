<b>Maintaining
the Proper Relationship

</b><span>(Joh 3:29)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Goodness
and purity should never be traits that draw attention to themselves, but should
simply be magnets that draw people to Jesus Christ. If my holiness is not
drawing others to Him, it is not the right kind of holiness; it is only an
influence which awakens undue emotions and evil desires in people and diverts
them from heading in the right direction. A person who is a beautiful saint can
be a hindrance in leading people to the Lord by presenting only what Christ has
done for him, instead of presenting Jesus Christ Himself. Others will be left
with this thought --- &quot;What a fine person that man is!&quot; That is not
being a true &quot;friend of the bridegroom&quot; --- <i>I</i> am increasing
all the time; <i>He</i> is not.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>To
maintain this friendship and faithfulness to the Bridegroom, we have to be more
careful to have the moral and vital relationship to Him above everything else,
including obedience. Sometimes there is nothing to obey and our only task is to
maintain a vital connection with Jesus Christ, seeing that nothing interferes
with it. Only occasionally is it a matter of obedience. At those times when a
crisis arises, we have to find out what God''s will is. Yet most of our life is
not spent in trying to be consciously obedient, but in maintaining this
relationship --- being the &quot;friend of the bridegroom.&quot; Christian work
can actually be a means of diverting a person''s focus away from Jesus Christ.
Instead of being friends &quot;of the bridegroom,&quot; we may become amateur
providences of God to someone else, working against Him while we use His
weapons.
