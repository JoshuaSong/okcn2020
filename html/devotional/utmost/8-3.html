<b>The
Compelling Purpose of God

</b><span>(Luk 18:31)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Jerusalem,
in the life of our Lord, represents the place where He reached the culmination
of His Father''s will. Jesus said, &quot;I do not seek My own will but the will
of the Father who sent Me&quot; (Joh 5:30</span>).
Seeking to do &quot;the will of the Father&quot; was the one dominating concern
throughout our Lord''s life. And whatever He encountered along the way, whether
joy or sorrow, success or failure, He was never deterred from that purpose.
&quot;. . . He steadfastly set His face to go to Jerusalem . . .&quot; (<span
>Luk 9:51</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
greatest thing for us to remember is that we go up to Jerusalem to fulfill
God''s purpose, not our own. In the natural life our ambitions are our own, but
in the Christian life we have no goals of our own. We talk so much today about
our decisions for Christ, our determination to be Christians, and our decisions
for this and that, but in the New Testament the only aspect that is brought out
is the compelling purpose of God. &quot;You did not choose Me, but I chose you
. . .&quot; (Joh 15:16</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>We
are not taken into a conscious agreement with God''s purpose --- we are taken
into God''s purpose with no awareness of it at all. We have no idea what God''s
goal may be; as we continue, His purpose becomes even more and more vague.
God''s aim appears to have missed the mark, because we are too nearsighted to
see the target at which He is aiming. At the beginning of the Christian life,
we have our own ideas as to what God''s purpose is. We say, &quot;God means for
me to go over there,&quot; and, &quot;God has called me to do this special
work.&quot; We do what we think is right, and yet the compelling purpose of God
remains upon us. The work we do is of no account when compared with the
compelling purpose of God. It is simplythe scaffolding surrounding His work and
His plan. &quot;He took the twelve aside . . .&quot; (<span
>Luk 18:31</span>). God takes us aside all the time. We
have not yet understood all there is to know of the compelling purpose of God.
