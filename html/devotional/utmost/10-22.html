<b>The
Witness of the Spirit

</b><span>(Rom 8:16)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>We
are in danger of getting into a bargaining spirit with God when we come to Him
--- we want the witness of the Spirit before we have done what God tells us to
do.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Why
doesn''t God reveal Himself to you? He cannot. It is not that He will not, but
He cannot, because you are in the way as long as you won''t abandon yourself to
Him in total surrender. Yet once you do, immediately God witnesses to Himself
--- He cannot witness to you, but He instantly witnesses to His own nature in
you. If you received the witness of the Spirit before the reality and truth
that comes from obedience, it would simply result in sentimental emotion. But
when you act on the basis of redemption, and stop the disrespectfulness of
debating with God, He immediately gives His witness. As soon as you abandon
your own reasoning and arguing, God witnesses to what He has done, and you are
amazed at your total disrespect in having kept Him waiting. If you are debating
as to whether or not God can deliver from sin, then either let Him do it or
tell Him that He cannot. Do not quote this or that person to Him. Simply obey (<span
>Mat 11:28</span>), &quot;Come to Me, all you who labor
and are heavy laden . . . .&quot; <i>Come,</i> if you are weary, and <i>ask,</i>
if you know you are evil (Luk 11:9-13</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
Spirit of God witnesses to the redemption of our Lord, and to nothing else. He
cannot witness to our reason. We are inclined to mistake the simplicity that
comes from our natural commonsense decisions for the witness of the Spirit, but
the Spirit witnesses only to His own nature, and to the work of redemption,
never to our reason. If we are trying to make Him witness to our reason, it is
no wonder that we are in darkness and uncertainty. Throw it all overboard,
trust in Him, and He will give you the witness of the Spirit.
