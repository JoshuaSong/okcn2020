<b>The
Spiritual Search

</b><span>(Mat 7:9)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>The
illustration of prayer that our Lord used here is one of a good child who is
asking for something good. We talk about prayer as if God hears us regardless
of what our relationship is to Him (Mat 5:45</span>).
Never say that it is not God''s will to give you what you ask. Don''t faint and
give up, but find out the reason you have not received; increase the intensity
of your search and examine the evidence. Is your relationship right with your
spouse, your children, and your fellow students? Are you a &quot;good
child&quot; in those relationships? Do you have to say to the Lord, &quot;I
have been irritable and cross, but I still want spiritual blessings&quot;? You
cannot receive and will have to do without them until you have the attitude of
a &quot;good child.&quot;

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>We
mistake defiance for devotion, arguing with God instead of surrendering. We
refuse to look at the evidence that clearly indicates where we are wrong. Have
I been asking God to give me money for something I want, while refusing to pay
someone what I owe him? Have I been asking God for liberty while I am
withholding it from someone who belongs to me? Have I refused to forgive
someone, and have I been unkind to that person? Have I been living as God''s
child among my relatives and friends? (Mat 7:12</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>I
am a child of God only by being born again, and as His child I am good only as
I &quot;walk in the light&quot; (1Jo 1:7</span>).
For most of us, prayer simply becomes some trivial religious expression, a
matter of mystical and emotional fellowship with God. We are all good at
producing spiritual fog that blinds our sight. But if we will search out and
examine the evidence, we will see very clearly what is wrong --- a friendship,
an unpaid debt, or an improper attitude. There is no use praying unless we are
living as children of God. Then Jesus says, regarding His children,
&quot;Everyone who asks receives . . .&quot; (Mat 7:8</span>).
