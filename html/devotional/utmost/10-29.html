<b>Substitution

</b><span>(2Co 5:21)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>The
modern view of the death of Jesus is that He died for our sins out of sympathy
for us. Yet the New Testament view is that He took our sin on Himself not
because of sympathy, but because of His identification with us. He was <i>&quot;made
. . . to be sin</i> . . . .&quot; Our sins are removed because of the death of
Jesus, and the only explanation for His death is His obedience to His Father,
not His sympathy for us. We are acceptable to God not because we have obeyed,
nor because we have promised to give up things, but because of the death of
Christ, and for no other reason. We say that Jesus Christ came to reveal the
fatherhood and the lovingkindness of God, but the New Testament says that He
came to take &quot;away the sin of the world!&quot; (<span style='color:
black'>Joh 1:29</span>). And the revealing of the fatherhood of God is only
to those to whom Jesus has been introduced as Savior. In speaking to the world,
Jesus Christ never referred to Himself as One who revealed the Father, but He
spoke instead of being a stumbling block (Joh 15:22-24</span>).
(Joh 14:9</span>), where Jesus said, &quot;He
who has seen Me has seen the Father,&quot; was spoken to His disciples.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>That
Christ died for me, and therefore I am completely free from penalty, is never
taught in the New Testament. What is taught in the New Testament is that
&quot;He died for all&quot; (2Co 5:15</span>)
--- not, &quot;He died my death&quot; --- and that through identification with
His death I can be freed from sin, and have His very righteousness imparted as
a gift to me. The substitution which is taught in the New Testament is twofold
--- &quot;For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, <i>that we might
become the righteousness of God in Him.&quot;</i> The teaching is not Christ <i>for</i>
me unless I am determined to have Christ formed <i>in</i> me (<span
>Gal 4:19</span>).
