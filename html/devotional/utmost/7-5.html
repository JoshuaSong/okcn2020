<b>Don''t
Plan Without God

</b><span>(Psa 37:5)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/><b>Don''t
plan without God.</b>
God seems to have a delightful way of upsetting the plans we have made, when we
have not taken Him into account. We get ourselves into circumstances that were
not chosen by God, and suddenly we realize that we have been making our plans
without Him --- that we have not even considered Him to be a vital, living
factor in the planning of our lives. And yet the only thing that will keep us
from even the possibility of worrying is to bring God in as the greatest factor
in all of our planning.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>In
spiritual issues it is customary for us to put God first, but we tend to think
that it is inappropriate and unnecessary to put Him first in the practical,
everyday issues of our lives. If we have the idea that we have to put on our
&quot;spiritual face&quot; before we can come near to God, then we will never
come near to Him. We must come as we are.

<br/><b>Don''t
plan with a concern for evil in mind.</b><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:"Trebuchet MS","sans-serif"'> Does God really mean for us to
plan without taking the evil around us into account? &quot;Love . . . thinks no
evil&quot;(1Co 13:4-5</span>). Love is not
ignorant of the existence of evil, but it does not take it into account as a
factor in planning. When we were apart from God, we did take evil into account,
doing all of our planning with it in mind, and we tried to reason out all of
our work from its standpoint.

<br/><b>Don''t
plan with a rainy day in mind.</b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:
"Trebuchet MS","sans-serif"'> You cannot hoard things for a rainy day if you
are truly trusting Christ. Jesus said, &quot;Let not your heart be troubled . .
.&quot; Joh 14:1</span>. God will not keep
your heart from being troubled. It is a command ---<i>&quot;Let not</i> . . .
.&quot; To do it, continually pick yourself up, even if you fall a hundred and
one times a day, until you get into the habit of putting God first and planning
with Him in mind.
