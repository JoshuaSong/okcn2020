<b>Do
You Walk In White?

</b><span>(Rom 6:4)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>No
one experiences complete sanctification without going through a &quot;white
funeral&quot; --- the burial of the old life. If there has never been this
crucial moment of change through death, sanctification will never be more than
an elusive dream. There must be a &quot;white funeral,&quot; a death with only
one resurrection --- a resurrection into the life of Jesus Christ. Nothing can
defeat a life like this. It has oneness with God for only one purpose --- to be
a witness for Him.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Have
you really come to your last days? You have often come to them in your mind,
but have you <i>really</i> experienced them? You cannot die or go to your
funeral in a mood of excitement. Death means you stop being. You must agree
with God and stop being the intensely striving kind of Christian you have been.
We avoid the cemetery and continually refuse our own death. It will not happen
by striving, but by yielding to death. It is dying --- being &quot;baptized
into His death&quot; (Rom 6:3</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Have
you had your &quot;white funeral,&quot; or are you piously deceiving your own
soul? Has there been a point in your life which you now mark as your last day?
Is there a place in your life to which you go back in memory with humility and
overwhelming gratitude, so that you can honestly proclaim, &quot;Yes, it was
then, at my ''white funeral,'' that I made an agreement with God.&quot;

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;This
is the will of God, your sanctification . . .&quot; (<span style='color:
black'>1Th 4:3</span>). Once you truly realize this is God''s will, you
will enter into the process of sanctification as a natural response. Are you
willing to experience that &quot;white funeral&quot; now? Will you agree with
Him that this is your last day on earth? The moment of agreement depends on
you.
