<b>A
Life of Pure and Holy Sacrifice

</b><span>(Joh 7:38)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Jesus
did not say, &quot;He who believes in Me will realize all the blessings of the
fullness of God,&quot; but, in essence, &quot;He who believes in Me will have
everything he receives escape out of him.&quot; Our Lord''s teaching was always
<i>anti</i>-self-realization. His purpose is not the development of a person
--- His purpose is to make a person exactly like Himself, and the Son of God is
characterized by self-expenditure. If we believe in Jesus, it is not what we
gain but what He pours through us that really counts. God''s purpose is not
simply to make us beautiful, plump grapes, but to make us grapes so that He may
squeeze the sweetness out of us. Our spiritual life cannot be measured by
success as the world measures it, but only by what God pours through us --- and
we cannot measure that at all.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>When
Mary of Bethany &quot;broke the flask . . . of very costly oil . . . and poured
it on [Jesus''] head,&quot; it was an act for which no one else saw any special
occasion; in fact, &quot;. . . there were some who . . . said, ''Why was this
fragrant oil wasted?'' &quot; (Mar 14:3-4</span>).
But Jesus commended Mary for her extravagant act of devotion, and said, &quot;.
. . wherever this gospel is preached . . . what this woman has done will also
be told as a memorial to her&quot; (Mar 14:9</span>).
Our Lord is filled with overflowing joy whenever He sees any of us doing what
Mary did --- not being bound by a particular set of rules, but being totally
surrendered to Him. God poured out the life of His Son &quot;that the world
through Him might be saved&quot; (Joh 3:17</span>).
Are we prepared to pour out our lives for Him?

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;He
who believes in Me . . . out of his heart will flow rivers of living
water&quot; --- and hundreds of other lives will be continually refreshed. Now
is the time for us to break &quot;the flask&quot; of our lives, to stop seeking
our own satisfaction, and to pour out our lives before Him. Our Lord is asking
who of us will do it for Him?
