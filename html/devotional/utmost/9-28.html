<b>The
&quot;Go&quot; of Unconditional Identification

</b><span>(Mar 10:21)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>The
rich young ruler had the controlling passion to be perfect. When he saw Jesus
Christ, he wanted to be like Him. Our Lord never places anyone''s personal
holiness above everything else when He calls a disciple. Jesus'' primary
consideration is my absolute annihilation of my right to myself and my
identification with Him, which means having a relationship with Him in which
there are no other relationships.&nbsp; (Luk 14:26</span>)
has nothing to do with salvation or sanctification, but deals solely with
unconditional identification with Jesus Christ. Very few of us truly know what
is meant by the absolute &quot;go&quot; of unconditional identification with,
and abandonment and surrender to, Jesus.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;Then
Jesus, looking at him, loved him . . .&quot; (Mar 10:21</span>).
This look of Jesus will require breaking your heart away forever from
allegiance to any other person or thing. Has Jesus ever looked in this way at
you? This look of Jesus transforms, penetrates, and captivates. Where you are
soft and pliable with God is where the Lord has looked at you. If you are hard
and vindictive, insistent on having your own way, and always certain that the
other person is more likely to be in the wrong than you are, then there are
whole areas of your nature that have never been transformed by His gaze.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;One
thing you lack . . . .&quot; From Jesus Christ''s perspective, oneness with
Him, with nothing between, is the only good thing.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;.
. . sell whatever you have . . . .&quot; I must humble myself until I am merely
a living person. I must essentially renounce possessions of all kinds, not for
salvation (for only one thing saves a person and that is absolute reliance in
faith upon Jesus Christ), but to follow Jesus. &quot;. . . come. . . and follow
Me.&quot; And the road is the way He went.
