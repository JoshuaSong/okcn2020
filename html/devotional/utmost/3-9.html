<b>Turning
Back or Walking with Jesus?

</b><span>(Joh 6:67)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>What
a penetrating question! Our Lord''s words often hit home for us when He speaks
in the simplest way. In spite of the fact that we know who Jesus is, He asks,
&quot;Do you also want to go away?&quot; We must continually maintain an
adventurous attitude toward Him, despite any potential personal risk.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;From
that time many of His disciples went back and walked with Him no more&quot; (<span
>Joh 6:66</span>). They turned back from walking with
Jesus; not into sin, but away from Him. Many people today are pouring their
lives out and working for Jesus Christ, but are not really walking with Him.
One thing God constantly requires of us is a oneness with Jesus Christ. After
being set apart through sanctification, we should discipline our lives
spiritually to maintain this intimate oneness. When God gives you a clear
determination of His will for you, all your striving to maintain that
relationship by some particular method is completely unnecessary. All that is
required is to live a natural life of absolute dependence on Jesus Christ. Never
try to live your life with God in any other way than His way. And His way means
absolute devotion to Him. Showing no concern for the uncertainties that lie
ahead is the secret of walking with Jesus.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Peter
saw in Jesus only someone who could minister salvation to him and to the world.
But our Lord wants us to be fellow laborers with Him.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>In
(Joh 6:70</span>) Jesus lovingly reminded
Peter that he was chosen to go with Him. And each of us must answer this
question for ourselves and no one else: &quot;Do you also want to go
away?&quot;
