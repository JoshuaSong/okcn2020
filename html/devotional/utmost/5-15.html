<b>The
Habit of Rising to the Occasion

</b><span>(Eph 1:18)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Remember
that you have been saved so that the life of Jesus may be manifested in your
body (2Co 4:10</span>). Direct the total
energy of your powers so that you may achieve everything your election as a
child of God provides; rise every time to whatever occasion may come your way.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>You
did not do anything to achieve your salvation, but you must do something to
exhibit it. You must &quot;work <i>out</i> your own salvation&quot; which God
has worked <i>in</i> you already (Phi 2:12</span>).
Are your speech, your thinking, and your emotions evidence that you are working
it &quot;out&quot;? If you are still the same miserable, grouchy person, set on
having your own way, then it is a lie to say that God has saved and sanctified
you.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>God
is the Master Designer, and He allows adversities into your life to see if you
can jump over them properly --- &quot;By my God I can leap over a wall&quot; (<span
>Psa 18:29</span>). God will never shield you from the
requirements of being His son or daughter. First Peter 4:12 (<span
>1Pe4:12</span>) says, &quot;Beloved, do not think it
strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange
thing happened to you . . . .&quot; Rise to the occasion --- do what the trial
demands of you. It does not matter how much it hurts as long as it gives God
the opportunity to manifest the life of Jesus in your body.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>May
God not find complaints in us anymore, but spiritual vitality --- a readiness
to face anything He brings our way. The only proper goal of life is that we
manifest the Son of God; and when this occurs, all of our dictating of our
demands to God disappears. Our Lord never dictated demands to His Father, and
neither are we to make demands on God. We are here to submit to His will so
that He may work through us what He wants. Once we realize this, He will make
us broken bread and poured-out wine with which to feed and nourish others.
