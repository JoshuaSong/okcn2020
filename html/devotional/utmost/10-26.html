<b>What
is a Missionary?

</b><span>(Joh 20:21)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>A
missionary is someone sent by Jesus Christ just as He was sent by God. The
great controlling factor is not the needs of people, but the command of Jesus.
The source of our inspiration in our service for God is behind us, not ahead of
us. The tendency today is to put the inspiration out in front --- to sweep
everything together in front of us and make it conform to our definition of
success. But in the New Testament the inspiration is put behind us, and is the
Lord Jesus Himself. The goal is to be true to Him --- to carry out <i>His</i>
plans.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Personal
attachment to the Lord Jesus and to His perspective is the one thing that must
not be overlooked. In missionary work the great danger is that God''s call will
be replaced by the needs of the people, to the point that human sympathy for
those needs will absolutely overwhelm the meaning of being sent by Jesus. The
needs are so enormous, and the conditions so difficult, that every power of the
mind falters and fails. We tend to forget that the one great reason underneath
all missionary work is not primarily the elevation of the people, their
education, nor their needs, but is first and foremost the command of Jesus
Christ --- &quot;Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations . . .&quot;
(Mat 28:19</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>When
looking back on the lives of men and women of God, the tendency is to say,
&quot;What wonderfully keen and intelligent wisdom they had, and how perfectly
they understood all that God wanted!&quot; But the keen and intelligent mind
behind them was the mind of God, not human wisdom at all. We give credit to
human wisdom when we should give credit to the divine guidance of God being
exhibited through childlike people who were &quot;foolish&quot; enough to trust
God''s wisdom and His supernatural equipment.
