<b>Prayerful
Inner-Searching

</b><span>(1Th 5:23)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>&nbsp;&quot;Your
whole spirit . . . .&quot; The great, mysterious work of the Holy Spirit is in
the deep recesses of our being which we cannot reach. Read Psalm 139. The
psalmist implies --- &quot;O Lord, You are the God of the early mornings, the
God of the late nights, the God of the mountain peaks, and the God of the sea.
But, my God, my soul has horizons further away than those of early mornings,
deeper darkness than the nights of earth, higher peaks than any mountain peaks,
greater depths than any sea in nature. You who are the God of all these, be my
God. I cannot reach to the heights or to the depths; there are motives I cannot
discover, dreams I cannot realize. My God, search me.&quot;

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Do
we believe that God can fortify and protect our thought processes far beyond
where we can go? <i>&quot;. . . the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us
from all sin&quot;</i> (1Jo 1:7</span>). If
this verse means cleansing only on our conscious level, may God have mercy on
us. The man who has been dulled by sin will say that he is not even conscious
of it. But the cleansing from sin we experience will reach to the heights and
depths of our spirit if we will &quot;walk in the light as He is in the
light&quot; (1Jo 1:7</span>). The same Spirit
that fed the life of Jesus Christ will feed the life of our spirit. It is only
when we are protected by God with the miraculous sacredness of the Holy Spirit
that our spirit, soul, and body can be preserved in pure uprightness until the
coming of Jesus --- no longer condemned in God''s sight.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>We
should more frequently allow our minds to meditate on these great, massive
truths of God.
