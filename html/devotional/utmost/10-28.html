<b>Justification
by Faith

</b><span>(Rom 5:10)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>I
am not saved by believing --- I simply realize I am saved by believing. And it
is not repentance that saves me --- repentance is only the sign that I realize
what God has done through Christ Jesus. The danger here is putting the emphasis
on the effect, instead of on the cause. Is it my obedience, consecration, and
dedication that make me right with God? It is never that! I am made right with
God because, prior to all of that, Christ died. When I turn to God and by
belief accept what God reveals, the miraculous atonement by the Cross of Christ
instantly places me into a right relationship with God. And as a result of the
supernatural miracle of God''s grace I stand justified, not because I am sorry
for my sin, or because I have repented, but because of what Jesus has done. The
Spirit of God brings justification with a shattering, radiant light, and I know
that I am saved, even though I don''t know how it was accomplished.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
salvation that comes from God is not based on human logic, but on the
sacrificial death of Jesus. We can be born again solely because of the
atonement of our Lord. Sinful men and women can be changed into new creations,
not through their repentance or their belief, but through the wonderful work of
God in Christ Jesus which preceded all of our experience (<span
>2Co 5:17-19</span>). The unconquerable safety of
justification and sanctification is God Himself. We do not have to accomplish
these things ourselvesthey have been accomplished through the atonement of the
Cross of Christ. The supernatural becomes natural to us through the miracle of
God, and there is the realization of what Jesus Christ has already done --- <i>&quot;It
is finished!&quot;</i> (Joh 19:30</span>).
