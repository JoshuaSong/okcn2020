<b>Total
Surrender

</b><span>(Mar 10:28)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Our
Lord replies to this statement of Peter by saying that this surrender is
&quot;for My sake and the gospel''s&quot; (Mar 10:29</span>).
It was not for the purpose of what the disciples themselves would get out of
it. Beware of surrender that is motivated by personal benefits that may result.
For example, &quot;I''m going to give myself to God because I want to be
delivered from sin, because I want to be made holy.&quot; Being delivered from
sin and being made holy are the result of being right with God, but surrender resulting
from this kind of thinking is certainly not the true nature of Christianity.
Our motive for surrender should not be <i>for</i> any personal gain at all. We
have become so self-centered that we go to God only for something from Him, and
not for God Himself. It is like saying, &quot;No, Lord, I don''t want you; I
want myself. But I do want You to clean me and fill me with Your Holy Spirit. I
want to be on display in Your showcase so I can say, ''This is what God has
done for me.'' &quot; Gaining heaven, being delivered from sin, and being made
useful to God are things that should never even be a consideration in real
surrender. Genuine total surrender is a personal sovereign preference for Jesus
Christ Himself.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Where
does Jesus Christ figure in when we have a concern about our natural
relationships? Most of us will desert Him with this excuse --- &quot;Yes, Lord,
I heard you call me, but my family needs me and I have my own interests. I just
can''t go any further&quot; (Luk 9:57-62</span>).
&quot;Then,&quot; Jesus says, &quot;you ''cannot be My disciple'' &quot; (<span
>Luk 14:26-33</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>True
surrender will always go beyond natural devotion. If we will only give up, God
will surrender Himself to embrace all those around us and will meet their
needs, which were created by our surrender. Beware of stopping anywhere short
of total surrender to God. Most of us have only a vision of what this really
means, but have never truly experienced it.
