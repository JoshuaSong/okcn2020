<b>Building
on the Atonement

</b><span>(Rom 6:13)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>I
cannot save and sanctify myself; I cannot make atonement for sin; I cannot
redeem the world; I cannot right what is wrong, purify what is impure, or make
holy what is unholy. That is all the sovereign work of God. Do I have faith in
what Jesus Christ has done? He has made the perfect atonement for sin. Am I in
the habit of constantly realizing it? The greatest need we have is not to <i>do</i>
things, but to <i>believe</i> things. The redemption of Christ is not an
experience, it is the great act of God which He has performed through Christ,
and I have to build my faith on it. If I construct my faith on my own
experience, I produce the most unscriptural kind of life --- an isolated life,
with my eyes focused solely on my own holiness. Beware of that human holiness
that is not based on the atonement of the Lord. It has no value for anything
except a life of isolation --- it is useless to God and a nuisance to man.
Measure every kind of experience you have by our Lord Himself. We cannot do
anything pleasing to God unless we deliberately build on the foundation of the
atonement by the Cross of Christ.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
atonement of Jesus must be exhibited in practical, unassuming ways in my life.
Every time I obey, the absolute deity of God is on my side, so that the grace
of God and my natural obedience are in perfect agreement. Obedience means that
I have completely placed my trust in the atonement, and my obedience is
immediately met by the delight of the supernatural grace of God.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Beware
of the human holiness that denies the reality of the natural life --- it is a
fraud. Continually bring yourself to the trial or test of the atonement and
ask, &quot;Where is the discernment of the atonement in this, and in
that?&quot;
