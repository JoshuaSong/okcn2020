<b>Taking
the Initiative Against Daydreaming

</b><span>(Joh 14:31)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Daydreaming
about something in order to do it properly is right, but daydreaming about it
when we should be doing it is wrong. In this passage, after having said these
wonderful things to His disciples, we might have expected our Lord to tell them
to go away and meditate over them all. But Jesus never allowed idle
daydreaming. When our purpose is to seek God and to discover His will for us,
daydreaming is right and acceptable. But when our inclination is to spend time
daydreaming over what we have already been told to do, it is unacceptable and
God''s blessing is never on it. God will take the initiative against this kind
of daydreaming by prodding us to action. His instructions to us will be along
the lines of this: &quot;Don''t sit or stand there, just go!&quot;

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>If
we are quietly waiting before God after He has said to us, &quot;Come aside by
yourselves . . .&quot; then that is meditation before Him to seek His will (<span
>Mar 6:31</span>). Beware, however, of giving in to mere
daydreaming once God has spoken. Allow Him to be the source of all your dreams,
joys, and delights, and be careful to go and obey what He has said. If you are
in love with someone, you don''t sit and daydream about that person all the
time --- you go and do something for him. That is what Jesus Christ expects us
to do. Daydreaming after God has spoken is an indication that we do not trust
Him.
