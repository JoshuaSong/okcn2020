<b>&quot;Acquainted
With Grief&quot;

</b><span>(Isa 53:3)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>We
are not &quot;acquainted with grief&quot; in the same way our Lord was
acquainted with it. We endure it and live through it, but we do not become
intimate with it. At the beginning of our lives we do not bring ourselves to
the point of dealing with the reality of sin. We look at life through the eyes
of reason and say that if a person will control his instincts, and educate
himself, he can produce a life that will slowly evolve into the life of God.
But as we continue on through life, we find the presence of something which we
have not yet taken into account, namely, sin --- and it upsets all of our
thinking and our plans. Sin has made the foundation of our thinking
unpredictable, uncontrollable, and irrational.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>We
have to recognize that sin is a fact of life, not just a shortcoming. Sin is
blatant mutiny against God, and either sin or God must die in my life. The New
Testament brings us right down to this one issue --- if sin rules in me, God''s
life in me will be killed; if God rules in me, sin in me will be killed. There
is nothing more fundamental than that. The culmination of sin was the
crucifixion of Jesus Christ, and what was true in the history of God on earth
will also be true in your history and in mine --- that is, sin will kill the
life of God in us. We must mentally bring ourselves to terms with this fact of
sin. It is the only explanation why Jesus Christ came to earth, and it is the
explanation of the grief and sorrow of life.
