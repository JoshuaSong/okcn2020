<b>Faith
or Experience?

</b><span>(Gal 2:20)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>We
should battle through our moods, feelings, and emotions into absolute devotion
to the Lord Jesus. We must break out of our own little world of experience into
abandoned devotion to Him. Think who the New Testament says Jesus Christ is,
and then think of the despicable meagerness of the miserable faith we exhibit
by saying, &quot;I haven''t had this experience or that experience&quot;! Think
what faith in Jesus Christ claims and provides --- He can present us faultless
before the throne of God, inexpressibly pure, absolutely righteous, and
profoundly justified. Stand in absolute adoring faith &quot;in Christ Jesus, who
became for us wisdom from God --- and righteousness and sanctification and
redemption . . .&quot; (1Co 1:30</span>). How
dare we talk of making a sacrifice for the Son of God! We are saved from hell
and total destruction, and then we talk about making sacrifices!

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>We
must continually focus and firmly place our faith in Jesus Christ --- not a
&quot;prayer meeting&quot; Jesus Christ, or a &quot;book&quot; Jesus Christ,
but the New Testament Jesus Christ, who is God Incarnate, and who ought to
strike us dead at His feet. Our faith must be in the One from whom our
salvation springs. Jesus Christ wants our absolute, unrestrained devotion to
Himself. We can never <i>experience</i> Jesus Christ, or selfishly bind Him in
the confines of our own hearts. Our faith must be built on strong determined
confidence in Him.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>It
is because of our trusting in experience that we see the steadfast impatience
of the Holy Spirit against unbelief. All of our fears are sinful, and we create
our own fears by refusing to nourish ourselves in our faith. How can anyone who
is identified with Jesus Christ suffer from doubt or fear! Our lives should be
an absolute hymn of praise resulting from perfect, irrepressible, triumphant
belief.
