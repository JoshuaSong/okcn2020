<b>The
Method of Missions

</b><span>(Mat 28:19)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Jesus
Christ did not say, &quot;Go and save souls&quot; (the salvation of souls is
the supernatural work of God), but He said, &quot;Go . . . make disciples of
all the nations . . . .&quot; Yet you cannot make disciples unless you are a
disciple yourself. When the disciples returned from their first mission, they
were filled with joy because even the demons were subject to them. But Jesus
said, in effect, &quot;Don''t rejoice in successful service --- the great
secret of joy is that you have the right relationship with Me&quot; (<span
>Luk 10:17-20</span>). The missionary''s great essential
is remaining true to the call of God, and realizing that his one and only
purpose is to disciple men and women to Jesus. Remember that there is a passion
for souls that does not come from God, but from our desire to make converts to
our point of view.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
challenge to the missionary does not come from the fact that people are
difficult to bring to salvation, that backsliders are difficult to reclaim, or
that there is a barrier of callous indifference. No, the challenge comes from
the perspective of the missionary''s own personal relationship with Jesus
Christ ---&quot;Do you believe that I am able to do this?&quot; (<span
>Mat 9:28</span>). Our Lord unwaveringly asks us that
question, and it confronts us in every individual situation we encounter. The
one great challenge to us is --- do I know my risen Lord? Do I know the power
of His indwelling Spirit? Am I wise enough in God''s sight, but foolish enough
according to the wisdom of the world, to trust in what Jesus Christ has said?
Or am I abandoning the great supernatural position of limitless confidence in
Christ Jesus, which is really God''s only call for a missionary? If I follow
any other method, I depart altogether from the methods prescribed by our Lord
---&quot;All authority has been given to Me . . . . <i>Go therefore</i> . .
.&quot; (Mat 28:18-19</span>).
