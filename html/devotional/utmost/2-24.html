<b>The
Destitution of Service

</b><span>(2Co 12:15)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Natural
human love expects something in return. But Paul is saying, &quot;It doesn''t
really matter to me whether you love me or not. I am willing to be completely
destitute anyway; willing to be poverty-stricken, not just for your sakes, but
also that I may be able to get you to God.&quot; &quot;For you know the grace
of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became
poor . . .&quot; (2Co 8:9</span>). And Paul''s
idea of service was the same as our Lord''s. He did not care how high the cost
was to himself --- he would gladly pay it. It was a joyful thing to Paul.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
institutional church''s idea of a servant of God is not at all like Jesus
Christ''s idea. His idea is that we serve Him by being the servants of others.
Jesus Christ actually &quot;out-socialized&quot; the socialists. He said that
in His kingdom the greatest one would be the servant of all (<span
>Mat 23:11</span>). The real test of a saint is not
one''s willingness to preach the gospel, but one''s willingness to do something
like washing the disciples'' feetthat is, being willing to do those things that
seem unimportant in human estimation but count as everything to God. It was
Paul''s delight to spend his life for God''s interests in other people, and he
did not care what it cost. But before we will serve, we stop to ponder our
personal and financial concerns --- &quot;What if God wants me to go over
there? And what about my salary? What is the climate like there? Who will take
care of me? A person must consider all these things.&quot; All that is an
indication that we have reservations about serving God. But the apostle Paul
had no conditions or reservations. Paul focused his life on Jesus Christ''s
idea of a New Testament saint; that is, not one who merely proclaims the
gospel, but one who becomes broken bread and poured-out wine in the hands of
Jesus Christ for the sake of others.
