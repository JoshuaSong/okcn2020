<b>Untroubled
Relationship

</b><span>(Joh 16:26-27)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>In
that day you will ask in My name . . . ,&quot; that is, in My nature. Not&nbsp;
--- &quot;You will use My name as some magic word,&quot; but --- &quot;You will
be so intimate with Me that you will be one with Me.&quot; &quot;That day&quot;
is not a day in the next life, but a day meant for here and now. &quot;. . .
for the Father Himself loves you . . .&quot; --- the Father''s love is evidence
that our union with Jesus is complete and absolute. Our Lord does not mean that
our lives will be free from external difficulties and uncertainties, but that
just as He knew the Father''s heart and mind, we too can be lifted by Him into
heavenly places through the baptism of the Holy Spirit, so that He can reveal
the teachings of God to us.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;.
. . whatever you ask the Father in My name . . .&quot; (<span
>Joh 16:23</span>). &quot;That day&quot; is a day of
peace and an untroubled relationship between God and His saint. Just as Jesus
stood unblemished and pure in the presence of His Father, we too by the mighty
power and effectiveness of the baptism of the Holy Spirit can be lifted into
that relationship --- &quot;. . . that they may be one just as We are one . .
.&quot; (Joh 17:22</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;.
. . He will give you&quot; (Joh 16:23</span>).
Jesus said that because of His name God will recognize and respond to our
prayers. What a great challenge and invitation --- to pray in His name! Through
the resurrection and ascension power of Jesus, and through the Holy Spirit He
has sent, we can be lifted into such a relationship. Once in that wonderful
position, having been placed there by Jesus Christ, we can pray to God in
Jesus'' name --- in His nature. This is a gift granted to us through the Holy
Spirit, and Jesus said, &quot;. . . whatever you ask the Father in My name He
will give you.&quot; The sovereign character of Jesus Christ is tested and
proved by His own statements.
