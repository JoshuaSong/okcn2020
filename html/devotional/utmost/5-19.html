<b>&quot;Out
of the Wreck I Rise&quot; 

</b><span>(Rom 8:35)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>God
does not keep His child immune from trouble; He promises, &quot;I will be with
him in trouble . . .&quot; (Psa 91:15</span>).
It doesn''t matter how real or intense the adversities may be; nothing can ever
separate him from his relationship to God. <i>&quot;In</i> all these things we
are more than conquerors . . .&quot; (Rom 8:37</span>).
Paul was not referring here to imaginary things, but to things that are
dangerously real. And he said we are &quot;super-victors&quot; in the midst of
them, not because of our own ingenuity, nor because of our courage, but because
none of them affects our essential relationship with God in Jesus Christ. I
feel sorry for the Christian who doesn''t have something in the circumstances
of his life that he wishes were not there.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;Shall
tribulation . . . ?&quot; Tribulation is never a grand, highly welcomed event;
but whatever it may be --- whether exhausting, irritating, or simply causing
some weakness --- it is not able to &quot;separate us from the love of
Christ.&quot; Never allow tribulations or the &quot;cares of this world&quot;
to separate you from remembering that God loves you (<span style='color:
black'>Mat 13:22</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;Shall
. . . distress . . . ?&quot; Can God''s love continue to hold fast, even when
everyone and everything around us seems to be saying that His love is a lie,
and that there is no such thing as justice?

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;Shall
. . . famine . . . ?&quot; Can we not only believe in the love of God but also
be &quot;more than conquerors,&quot; even while we are being starved?

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Either
Jesus Christ is a deceiver, having deceived even Paul, or else some
extraordinary thing happens to someone who holds on to the love of God when the
odds are totally against him. Logic is silenced in the face of each of these
things which come against him. Only one thing can account for it --- the <i>love
of God in Christ Jesus.</i> &quot;Out of the wreck I rise&quot; every time.
