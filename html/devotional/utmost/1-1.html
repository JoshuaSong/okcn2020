<b>Will
You Go Out Without Knowing?

</b><span>(Heb 11:8)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Have
you ever &quot;gone out&quot; in this way? If so, there is no logical answer
possible when anyone asks you what you are doing. One of the most difficult
questions to answer in Christian work is, &quot;What do you expect to do?&quot;
You don''t know what you are going to do. The only thing you know is that God
knows what He is doing. Continually examine your attitude toward God to see if
you are willing to &quot;go out&quot; in every area of your life, trusting in
God entirely. It is this attitude that keeps you in constant wonder, because you
don''t know what God is going to do next. Each morning as you wake, there is a
new opportunity to &quot;go out,&quot; building your confidence in God. &quot;.
. . do not worry about your life . . . nor about the body . . .&quot; (<span
>Luk 12:22</span>). In other words, don''t worry about
the things that concerned you before you did &quot;go out.&quot;

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Have
you been asking God what He is going to do? He will never tell you. God does
not tell you what He is going to do --- He reveals to you who He is. Do you
believe in a miracle-working God, and will you &quot;go out&quot; in complete
surrender to Him until you are not surprised one iota by anything He does?

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Believe
God is always the God you know Him to be when you are nearest to Him. Then
think how unnecessary and disrespectful worry is! Let the attitude of your life
be a continual willingness to &quot;go out&quot; in dependence upon God, and
your life will have a sacred and inexpressible charm about it that is very
satisfying to Jesus. You must learn to &quot;go out&quot; through your
convictions, creeds, or experiences until you come to the point in your faith
where there is nothing between yourself and God.
