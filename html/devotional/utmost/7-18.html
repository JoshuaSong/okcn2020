<b>The
Mystery of Believing

</b><span>(Act 9:5)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Through
the miracle of redemption, Saul of Tarsus was instantly changed from a
strong-willed and forceful Pharisee into a humble and devoted bondservant of
the Lord Jesus.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>There
is nothing miraculous or mysterious about the things we can explain. We control
what we are able to explain, consequently it is only natural to seek an
explanation for everything. It is not natural to obey, yet it is not
necessarily sinful to disobey. There can be no real disobedience, nor any moral
virtue in obedience, unless a person recognizes the higher authority of the one
giving the orders. If this recognition does not exist, even the one giving the
orders may view the other person''s disobedience as freedom. If one rules
another by saying, &quot;You must do this,&quot; and, &quot;You will do
that,&quot; he breaks the human spirit, making it unfit for God. A person is
simply a slave for obeying, unless behind his obedience is the recognition of a
holy God.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Many
people begin coming to God once they stop being religious, because there is only
one master of the human heart --- Jesus Christ, not religion. But &quot;Woe is
me&quot; if after seeing <i>Him</i> I still <i>will not</i> obey (<span
>Isa 6:5</span>). Jesus will never insist that I obey,
but if I don''t,I have already begun to sign the death certificate of the Son
of God in my soul. When I stand face to face with Jesus Christ and say, &quot;I
will not obey,&quot; He will never insist. But when I do this, I am backing
away from the recreating power of His redemption. It makes no difference to
God''s grace what an abomination I am, if I will only come to the light. But
&quot;Woe is me&quot; if I refuse the light (Joh 3:19-21</span>).
