<br/>If
in preaching the gospel you substitute your knowledge of the way of salvation
for confidence in the power of the gospel, you hinder people from getting to
reality. Take care to see while you proclaim your knowledge of the way of
salvation, that you yourself are rooted and grounded by faith in God. Never
rely on the clearness of your presentation, but as you give your explanation
make sure that you are relying on the Holy Spirit. Rely on the certainty of
God''s redemptive power, and He will create His own life in people.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Once
you are rooted in reality, nothing can shake you. If your faith is in
experiences, anything that happens is likely to upset that faith. But nothing
can ever change God or the reality of redemption. Base your faith on that, and
you are as eternally secure as God Himself. Once you have a personal
relationship with Jesus Christ, you will never be moved again. That is the
meaning of sanctification. God disapproves of our human efforts to cling to the
concept that sanctification is merely an experience, while forgetting that even
our sanctification must also be sanctified (Joh 17:19</span>).
I must deliberately give my sanctified life to God for His service, so that He
can use me as His hands and His feet.
