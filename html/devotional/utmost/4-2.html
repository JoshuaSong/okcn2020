<b>The
Glory That''s Unsurpassed

</b><span>(Act 9:17)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>When
Paul received his sight, he also received spiritual insight into the Person of
Jesus Christ. His entire life and preaching from that point on were totally
consumed with nothing but Jesus Christ --- &quot;For I determined not to know
anything among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified&quot; (<span
>1Co 2:2</span>). Paul never again allowed anything to
attract and hold the attention of his mind and soul except the face of Jesus
Christ.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>We
must learn to maintain a strong degree of character in our lives, even to the
level that has been revealed in our vision of Jesus Christ.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
lasting characteristic of a spiritual man is the ability to understand
correctly the meaning of the Lord Jesus Christ in his life, and the ability to
explain the purposes of God to others. The overruling passion of his life is
Jesus Christ. Whenever you see this quality in a person, you get the feeling
that he is truly a man after God''s own heart (Act 13:22</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Never
allow anything to divert you from your insight into Jesus Christ. It is the
true test of whether you are spiritual or not. To be unspiritual means that
other things have a growing fascination for you.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Since
mine eyes have looked on Jesus, 

<br/>I''ve
lost sight of all beside, 

<br/>So
enchained my spirit''s vision, 

<br/>Gazing
on the Crucified.
