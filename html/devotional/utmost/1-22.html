<b>Transformed
by Beholding

</b><span>(2Co 3:18)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>&nbsp;The
greatest characteristic a Christian can exhibit is this completely unveiled
openness before God, which allows that person''s life to become a mirror for
others. When the Spirit fills us, we are transformed, and by beholding God we
become mirrors. You can always tell when someone has been beholding the glory
of the Lord, because your inner spirit senses that he mirrors the Lord''s own
character. Beware of anything that would spot or tarnish that mirror in you. It
is almost always something good that will stain it --- something good, but not
what is best.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
most important rule for us is to concentrate on keeping our lives open to God.
Let everything else including work, clothes, and food be set aside. The
busyness of things obscures our concentration on God. We must maintain a
position of beholding Him, keeping our lives completely spiritual through and
through. Let other things come and go as they will; let other people criticize
us as they will; but never allow anything to obscure the life that &quot;is
hidden with Christ in God&quot; (Col 3:3</span>).
Never let a hurried lifestyle disturb the relationship of abiding in Him. This
is an easy thing to allow, but we must guard against it. The most difficult
lesson of the Christian life is learning how to continue &quot;beholding as in
a mirror the glory of the Lord . . . .&quot;
