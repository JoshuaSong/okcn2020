<b>The
Undetected Sacredness of Circumstances

</b><span>(Rom 8:28)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>The
circumstances of a saint''s life are ordained of God. In the life of a saint
there is no such thing as chance. God by His providence brings you into
circumstances that you can''t understand at all, but the Spirit of God
understands. God brings you to places, among people, and into certain
conditions to accomplish a definite purpose through the intercession of the
Spirit in you. Never put yourself in front of your circumstances and say,
&quot;I''m going to be my own providence here; I will watch this closely, or
protect myself from that.&quot; All your circumstances are in the hand of God,
and therefore you don''t ever have to think they are unnatural or unique. Your
part in intercessory prayer is not to agonize over how to intercede, but to use
the everyday circumstances and people God puts around you by His providence to
bring them before His throne, and to allow the Spirit in you the opportunity to
intercede for them. In this way God is going to touch the whole world with His
saints.

<br/>Am
I making the Holy Spirit''s work difficult by being vague and unsure, or by
trying to do His work for Him? I must do the human side of intercession ---
utilizing the circumstances in which I find myself and the people who surround
me. I must keep my conscious life as a sacred place for the Holy Spirit. Then
as I lift different ones to God through prayer, the Holy Spirit intercedes for
them.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Your
intercessions can never be mine, and my intercessions can never be yours,
&quot;. . . but the Spirit Himself makes intercession&quot; in each of our
lives (Rom 8:26</span>). And without that
intercession, the lives of others would be left in poverty and in ruin.
