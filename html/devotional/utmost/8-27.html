<b>Living
Your Theology

</b><span>(Joh 12:35)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Beware
of not acting upon what you see in your moments on the mountaintop with God. If
you do not obey the light, it will turn into darkness. &quot;If therefore the
light that is in you is darkness, how great is that darkness!&quot; (<span
>Mat 6:23</span>). The moment you forsake the matter of
sanctification or neglect anything else on which God has given you His light,
your spiritual life begins to disintegrate within you. Continually bring the
truth out into your real life, working it out into every area, or else even the
light that you possess will itself prove to be a curse.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>The
most difficult person to deal with is the one who has the prideful
self-satisfaction of a past experience, but is not working that experience out
in his everyday life. If you <i>say</i> you are sanctified, <i>show it.</i> The
experience must be so genuine that it shows in your life. Beware of any belief
that makes you self-indulgent or self-gratifying; that belief came from the pit
of hell itself, regardless of how beautiful it may sound.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Your
theology must work itself out, exhibiting itself in your most common everyday
relationships. Our Lord said, &quot;. . . unless your righteousness <i>exceeds</i>
the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you will by no means enter the
kingdom of heaven&quot; (Mat 5:20</span>). In
other words, you must be more moral than the most moral person you know. You
may know all about the doctrine of sanctification, but are you working it out
in the everyday issues of your life? Every detail of your life, whether
physical, moral, or spiritual, is to be judged and measured by the standard of
the atonement by the Cross of Christ.
