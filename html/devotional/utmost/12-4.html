<b>The
Law of Opposition

</b><span>(Rev 2:7)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Life
without war is impossible in the natural or the supernatural realm. It is a
fact that there is a continuing struggle in the physical, mental, moral, and
spiritual areas of life.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Health
is the balance between the physical parts of my body and all the things and
forces surrounding me. To maintain good health I must have sufficient internal
strength to fight off the things that are external. Everything outside my
physical life is designed to cause my death. The very elements that sustain me
while I am alive work to decay and disintegrate my body once it is dead. If I
have enough inner strength to fight, I help to produce the balance needed for
health. The same is true of the mental life. If I want to maintain a strong and
active mental life, I have to fight. This struggle produces the mental balance
called thought.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Morally
it is the same. Anything that does not strengthen me morally is the enemy of
virtue within me. Whether I overcome, thereby producing virtue, depends on the
level of moral excellence in my life. But we must fight to be moral. Morality
does not happen by accident; moral virtue is acquired.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>And
spiritually it is also the same. Jesus said, &quot;In the world you will have
tribulation . . .&quot; (Joh 16:33</span>).
This means that anything which is not spiritual leads to my downfall. Jesus
went on to say, &quot;. . . but be of good cheer, I have overcome the
world.&quot; I must learn to fight against and overcome the things that come
against me, and in that way produce the balance of holiness. Then it becomes a
delight to meet opposition.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Holiness
is the balance between my nature and the law of God as expressed in Jesus
Christ.
