<b>Intimate
Theology

</b><span>(Joh 11:26)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Martha
believed in the power available to Jesus Christ; she believed that if He had
been there He could have healed her brother; she also believed that Jesus had a
special intimacy with God, and that whatever He asked of God, God would do. But
--- she needed a closer personal intimacy with Jesus. Martha''s theology had
its fulfillment in the future. But Jesus continued to attract and draw her in
until her belief became an intimate possession. It then slowly emerged into a
personal inheritance --- &quot;Yes, Lord, I believe that You are the Christ . .
.&quot; (Joh 11:27</span>).

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Is
the Lord dealing with you in the same way? Is Jesus teaching you to have a
personal intimacy with Himself? Allow Him to drive His question home to you ---
&quot;Do you believe <i>this?&quot;</i> Are you facing an area of doubt in your
life? Have you come, like Martha, to a crossroads of overwhelming circumstances
where your theology is about to become a very personal belief? This happens
only when a personal problem brings the awareness of our personal need.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>To
believe is to commit. In the area of intellectual learning I commit myself
mentally, and reject anything not related to that belief. In the realm of
personal belief I commit myself morally to my convictions and refuse to
compromise. But in intimate personal belief I commit myself spiritually to
Jesus Christ and make a determination to be dominated by Him alone.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Then,
when I stand face to face with Jesus Christ and He says to me, &quot;Do you
believe this?&quot; I find that faith is as natural as breathing. And I am
staggered when I think how foolish I have been in not trusting Him earlier
