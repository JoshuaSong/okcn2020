<b>Do
You See Your Calling?

</b><span>(Rom 1:1)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Our
calling is not primarily to be holy men and women, but to be proclaimers of the
gospel of God. The one all-important thing is that the gospel of God should be
recognized as the abiding reality. Reality is not human goodness, or holiness,
or heaven, or hell --- it is redemption. The need to perceive this is the most
vital need of the Christian worker today. As workers, we have to get used to
the revelation that redemption is the only reality. Personal holiness is an
effect of redemption, not the cause of it. If we place our faith in human
goodness we will go under when testing comes.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>Paul
did not say that he separated himself, but &quot;when it pleased God, who
separated me . . .&quot; (Gal 1:15</span>).
Paul was not overly interested in his own character. And as long as our eyes
are focused on our own personal holiness, we will never even get close to the
full reality of redemption. Christian workers fail because they place their
desire for their own holiness above their desire to know God. &quot;Don''t ask
me to be confronted with the strong reality of redemption on behalf of the
filth of human life surrounding me today; what I want is anything God can do
for me to make me more desirable in my own eyes.&quot; To talk that way is a
sign that the reality of the gospel of God has not begun to touch me. There is
no reckless abandon to God in that. God cannot deliver me while my interest is
merely in my own character. Paul was not conscious of himself. He was
recklessly abandoned, totally surrendered, and separated by God for one purpose
--- to proclaim the gospel of God (Rom 9:3</span>).
