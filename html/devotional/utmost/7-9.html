<b>Will
You Examine Yourself?

</b><span>(Jos 24:19)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>Do
you have even the slightest reliance on anything or anyone other than God? Is
there a remnant of reliance left on any natural quality within you, or on any
particular set of circumstances? Are you relying on yourself in any manner
whatsoever regarding this new proposal or plan which God has placed before you?
Will you examine yourself by asking these probing questions? It really is true
to say, &quot;I cannot live a holy life,&quot; but you can decide to let Jesus
Christ make you holy. &quot;You cannot serve the Lord . . .&quot; --- but you
can place yourself in the proper position where God''s almighty power will flow
through you. Is your relationship with God sufficient for you to expect Him to
exhibit His wonderful life in you?

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;The
people said to Joshua, ''No, but we will serve the Lord!&quot; (<span
>Jos 24:21</span>). This is not an impulsive action, but
a deliberate commitment. We tend to say, &quot;But God could never have called <i>me</i>
to this. I''m too unworthy. It can''t mean <i>me.&quot;</i> It does mean you,
and the more weak and feeble you are, the better. The person who is still
relying and trusting in anything within himself is the last person to even come
close to saying, &quot;I will serve the Lord.&quot;

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>We
say, &quot;Oh, if only I really could believe!&quot; The question is, &quot;<i>Will</i>
I believe?&quot; No wonder Jesus Christ placed such emphasis on the sin of
unbelief. &quot;He did not do many mighty works there because of their
unbelief&quot; (Mat 13:58</span>). If we
really believed that God meant what He said, just imagine what we would be
like! Do I really dare to let God be to me all that He says He will be?
