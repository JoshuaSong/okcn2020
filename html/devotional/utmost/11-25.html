<b>The
Secret of Spiritual Consistency

</b><span>(Gal 6:14)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>When
a person is newly born again, he seems inconsistent due to his unrelated
emotions and the state of the external things or circumstances in his life. The
apostle Paul had a strong and steady underlying consistency in his life.
Consequently, he could let his external life change without internal distress
because he was rooted and grounded in God. Most of us are not consistent
spiritually because we are more concerned about being consistent externally. In
the external expression of things, Paul lived in the basement, while his
critics lived on the upper level. And these two levels do not begin to touch
each other. But Paul''s consistency was down deep in the fundamentals. The
great basis of his consistency was the agony of God in the redemption of the world,
namely, the Cross of Christ.

<br/>State
your beliefs to yourself again. Get back to the foundation of the Cross of
Christ, doing away with any belief not based on it. In secular history the
Cross is an infinitesimally small thing, but from the biblical perspective it
is of more importance than all the empires of the world. If we get away from
dwelling on the tragedy of God on the Cross in our preaching, our preaching
produces nothing. It will not transmit the energy of God to man; it may be
interesting, but it will have no power. However, when we preach the Cross, the
energy of God is released. &quot;. . . it pleased God through the foolishness
of the message preached to save those who believe. . . . we preach Christ
crucified . . .&quot; (1Co 1:21, 1Co 1:23</span>).
