<b>Identified
or Simply Interested?

</b><span>(Gal 2:20)

</span>&nbsp;

<br/>The
inescapable spiritual need each of us has is the need to sign the death
certificate of our sin nature. I must take my emotional opinions and
intellectual beliefs and be willing to turn them into a moral verdict against
the nature of sin; that is, against any claim I have to my right to myself.
Paul said, &quot;I have been crucified with Christ . . . .&quot; He did not
say, &quot;I have made a determination to imitate Jesus Christ,&quot; or,
&quot;I will really make an effort to follow Him&quot;--- but --- &quot;I have
been <i>identified</i> with Him in His death.&quot; Once I reach this moral
decision and act on it, all that Christ accomplished <i>for</i> me on the Cross
is accomplished <i>in</i> me. My unrestrained commitment of myself to God gives
the Holy Spirit the opportunity to grant to me the holiness of Jesus Christ.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;.
. . it is no longer I who live . . . .&quot; My individuality remains, but my
primary motivation for living and the nature that rules me are radically
changed. I have the same human body, but the old satanic right to myself has
been destroyed.

<br/>&nbsp;

<br/>&quot;.
. . and the life which I now live in the flesh,&quot; not the life which I long
to live or even pray that I live, but the life I now live in my mortal flesh
--- the life which others can see, &quot;I live by faith in the Son of God . .
. .&quot; This faith was not Paul''s own faith in Jesus Christ, but the faith
the Son God had given to him Eph 2:8</span>.
It is no longer a faith in faith, but a faith that transcends all imaginable
limits --- a faith that comes only from the Son of God.
