<B>THE VIRTUE OF PROPORTION<br/>
</B><br/>
<span>Mat 6:25-34</span><br/>
<br/>
I MUST put first things first. The radical fault in much of my living is want of proportion. I think more of pretty window curtains than of fresh air, more of “nice” wallpaper than of the moving pageant of the skies. I magnify the immediate desire and minimize the ultimate goal. And so “things do not come right!” How can they when the apportionment is so perverse, when everything is topsy-turvy? If I want things to be firm and durable I must revere the Divine order, and must put first things first. “Seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness.” <span>Mat 6:33</span> -note<br/>And, therefore, I must seek holiness before success. I am to esteem holiness with apparent failure as infinitely better than success with stain and shame. <br/>
<br/>
I must seek character before reputation. The applause of the world must be as nothing compared with the approbation of God. The favoring “voice from heaven” must be sweeter to my ears than the noisy cheers of the crowd.<br/>And I must seek righteousness before quietness. The way of disturbance is sometimes the way to peace. I must not be so concerned for a quiet life as for a life that is “right with God.” <br/>
