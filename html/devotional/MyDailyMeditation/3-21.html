<B>IN THE GOLDEN CITY</B>
<br/>
<span>Isa 52:1-12</span>
<br/>
AND so these are the glories of the golden city. There is wakefulness. “Awake! awake!” In the golden city none will be asleep. Everybody will be bright-eyed, clear-minded, looking upon all beautiful things with fresh and ready receptiveness. “The eyes of them that see shall not be dim.”<br/>There is strength. “Put on thy strength!” There will be no broken wills in the golden city, and no broken hearts. No one will walk with a limp! Everybody will go with a brave stride as to the strains of a band. And no one will tire of living, and the inhabitant never says, “I am sick.”<br/>And there is beauty. “Put on thy beautiful garments.” Bare strength might not be attractive. But strength clothed in beauty is a very gracious thing. The tender mosses on the granite make it winsome. Strength is companionable when it is united with grace. In the golden city there will be tender sentiment as well as rigid conviction.<br/>And these glories will be our defence. A positive virtue is our best rampart against vice. A robust health is the best protection against the epidemic. “The prince of this world cometh, and he hath nothing in me.”<br/>
