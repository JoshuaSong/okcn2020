<B>EXALTATION BY SEPARATION</B>
<br/>
<span>2Co 6:11-18</span>
<br/>
WHEN we turn away from the world, and leave it, we ourselves are not left to desolation and orphan-hood. When we “come out from among them” the Lord receives us! He is waiting for us. The new companionship is ours the moment the old companionship is ended. “I will not leave you comfortless.” What we have lost is compensated by infinite and eternal gain. We have lost “the whole world” and gained “the unsearchable riches of Christ.”<br/>And therefore separation is exaltation. We leave the muddy pleasures of Sodom and we “drink of the river of His pleasures.” We leave “the garish day,” and all the feverish life of Vanity Fair, and He maketh us “to lie down in green pastures,” “He leadeth us beside the still waters.” We leave a transient sensation, we receive the bread of eternity. We forfeit fireworks, we gain the stars!<br/>What fools we are, and blind! We prefer the scorched desert of Sodom to the garden of Eden. We prefer a loud reputation to noble character. We prefer delirium to joy. We prefer human applause to the praise of God. We prefer a fading garland to the crown of life. Lord, that we may receive our sight!
