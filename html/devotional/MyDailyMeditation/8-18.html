<B>THE CHURCH OF THE FIRSTBORN<br/>
</B>“Pray for the peace of Jerusalem.”
<span>Psa 122:1-9</span> <br/>
<br/>
AND my Jerusalem is “the church of the living God.” Do I carry her on my heart? Do I praise God for her heritage, and for her endowment of spiritual glory? And do I remember her perils, especially those parts of her walls where the defenses are very thin, and can be easily broken through? Yes, has my church any place in my prayer, or am I robbing her of part of her intended possessions?<br/>
And is the entire Jerusalem the subject of my supplication? Or do I only think of a corner of it, just that part where my own little synagogue is placed? Am I a Congregationalist; do I remember the Anglican? Am I an Anglican; do I remember the Quaker. Am I thus concerned only with a small section of Jerusalem, or does my intercession sweep the entire city?<br/>
“They shall prosper that love thee.” I cannot be healthy if I am bereft of fellowship. If I ignore the house of prayer I impoverish my home. The peaceful glow of the fireside is not unrelated to the coals upon the common altar. The sacrament is connected with my ordinary meal. To love the Church of Christ is to become enriched with “the fulness of Christ.”<br/>
