<B>HOW TO DELIGHT IN THE WORD<br/>
</B><span>Psa 119:97-104</span><br/>
A MAN may measure his growth in grace by his growing delight in the speech of the Lord. When His words are unwelcome in my ears, when they are an intrusion which mars my pleasures, it is clear I am still in the far country of revolt. But if His words make “music in my ears,” if the Lord’s conversation is the very marrow of the feast, then I have entered into the circle of His intimate friends. When His words taste sweet, even with a bare board, I am “in heavenly places with Christ.”<br/>And how can I attain unto this spiritual delight? Well, first of all I must make “His testimonies my meditations.” Our doctors tell us that the only way to taste the real savour of food is to masticate it well. Bolted food never unlocks its essences. And meditation is just mental mastication. To “turn the word over” in my mind will help to disburden its treasure.<br/>And then I must diligently put the word into practice. “I have not departed from Thy judgments.” There is nothing like obedience for setting free a spiritual essence. “The secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him.”
