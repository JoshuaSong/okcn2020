<b>THE LARGER OUTLOOK</b>
<br/>
<span>Gen 15:5-18</span>
<br/>

"AND He brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven!” The tent was changed for the sky! Abraham sat moodily in his tent: God brought him forth beneath the stars. And that is always the line of the Divine leading. He brings us forth out of our small imprisonments and He sets our feet in a large place. He desires for us height and breadth of view. For “as the heavens are high above the earth” so are His thoughts higher than our thoughts, and His ways than our ways. He wishes us, I say, to exchange the tent for the sky, and to live and move in great, spacious thoughts of His purposes and will.<br/>How is it with our love? Is it a thing of the tent or of the sky? Does it range over mighty spaces seeking benedictions for a multitude? Or does it dwell in selfish seclusion, imprisoned in merely selfish quest? How is it with our prayers? How big are they? Will a tent contain them, or do they move with the scope and greatness of the heavens? Do they just contain our own families, or is China in them, and India, and “the uttermost parts of the earth”? “Look now towards the heavens!” Such must be our outlook if we are the companions of God.<br/>
