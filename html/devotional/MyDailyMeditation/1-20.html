<B>THE PASSING OF THE BEAST<br/>
<br/>
</B><span>Eze 34:23-31</span>
<br/>
WHEN the Good Shepherd has charge of His flock “the wild beasts will cease out of the land.” All beastly passions shall be destroyed. The fair gardens of our souls shall no longer be ravaged by sleek pride, or fierce appetite, or ravenous lust. “Thou shalt tread upon the lion and the adder, the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.”<br/>And the forces of nature shall be in friendly co-operation. “I will cause the shower to come down in his season.” We are to have mystic allies in sky and field. Nature sides with the man who sides with God. Our very garden becomes our helpmeet when we are cultivating the fruits of the Spirit. The heavens assume a friendly aspect when we are “marching to beautiful Zion.” But when we are against the Lord all these forces appear to be hostile. “The stars in their courses fought against Sisera.”<br/>And we are to have a joyful assurance of the companionship of our God. “This shall they know, that I, the Lord their God, am with them.” And in that precious assurance every other treasure is found! Only be sure of that, and we shall walk about as kings and queens!
