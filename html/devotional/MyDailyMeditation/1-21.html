<B>THE VALUE OF ONE SOUL<br/>
<br/>
</B><span>Mat 18:7-14</span>
<br/>
WHAT an infinite value the Lord attaches to one soul! “And one of them be gone astray!” I thought He might never have missed the one! And yet the Eastern shepherd says that out of his great flock he can miss the individual face. A face is missing, as though a child were absent from the family circle. When a soul is wandering in the far country there is an awful gap in the Father’s house! Is thy place empty? Is mine?<br/>And mark the pangs of the Shepherd’s quest. He “goeth into the mountain and seeketh!” The Eastern shepherd goes out in tempest, and in rocky ravine, or in thorny scrub that tears the hands and feet, he seeks and finds his sheep. And my Lord sought me, in stony and thorny places, in the darkness of Gethsemane, and in the awful desolations of The Hill.<br/>And the Shepherd found His sheep, and He returns across the hills singing the song of the triumph of grace—<br/>
<br/>
“And up from the mountains, thunder-riven,
And up from the rocky steep,
A cry arose to the gates of heaven,
‘Rejoice! I have found My sheep!’
And the angels echo around the throne,
‘Rejoice! for the Lord brings back His own!’”<br/>
