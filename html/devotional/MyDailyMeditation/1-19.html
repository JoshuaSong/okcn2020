<B>THE LOST SHEEP<br/>
<br/>
</B><span>Eze 34:11-19</span>
<br/>
AND now, again, I am bidden to contemplate the gracious ministries of the Good Shepherd.<br/>The Good Shepherd searches the “far country” for His lost sheep. “I will bring them ... out of all places where they have been scattered.” He goes into the hard wilderness of cold indifference, and wasteful pride, and desolating sin, searching “high and low” for His foolish sheep. And no place is unvisited by the Great Seeker! Every perilous ravine, where a sheep can be lost, knows the footprints of the Shepherd. And He knows my far-country, and He is seeking me!<br/>And the Good Shepherd brings His wandering sheep back home. “I will bring them ... to their own land.” We return from the land of pride to the home of lowliness, from hard indifference to gracious sympathy, from the barrenness of sin to the beauty of holiness. We come back to God’s beautiful “lily-land” of eternal light and peace.<br/>And what nutriment the Good Shepherd provides for the home-coming sheep! “I will feed them in a good pasture.” Our wasted powers shall be renewed and strengthened by the fattening diet of grace. Love shall be both host and meat! “He will satisfy thy mouth with good things.”
