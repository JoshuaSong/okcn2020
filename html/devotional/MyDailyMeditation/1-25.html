<B>FIRST, MY BROTHER!<br/>
<br/>
</B><span>Mat 5:17-24</span>
<br/>
FIRST be reconciled to thy brother.” We are to put first things first. When we bring a gift unto the Lord He looks at the hand that brings it. If the hand is defiled the gift is rejected. “Wash you, make you clean.” “First be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.”<br/>All this tells us why some resplendent gifts are rejected, and why some commonplace gifts are received amid heavenly song. This is why the widow’s mite goes shining through the years. The hand that offered it was hallowed and purified with sacrifice. Shall we say that in that palm there was something akin to the pierced hands of the Lord? The mite had intimate associations with the Cross.<br/>And it also tells me why so much of our public worship is offensive to our Lord. We come to the church from a broken friendship. Some holy thing has been broken on the way. Someone’s estate has been invaded, and his treasure spoiled. Someone has been wronged, and God will not touch our gift. “Leave there thy gift; first be reconciled to thy brother.”
