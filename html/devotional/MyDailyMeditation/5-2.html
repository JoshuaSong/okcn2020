<B>THE HAPPY WARRIOR</B>
<br/>
<span>Eph 6:10-18</span>
<br/>
HERE is a portrait of the happy warrior! Let me first look at the warrior, and then at the implements with which he fights.<br/>“You cannot fight the French merely with red uniforms; there must be men inside them!” So said Thomas Carlyle. Well, look at this man. “Strengthened in the Lord, and in the power of His might.” There is a secret communion with the Almighty, and he draws his resources from the Infinite. The water in my home comes from the Welsh hills; every drop was gathered on those grand and expansive uplands. And this man’s soldierly strength is drawn from the hills of God; every ounce of his fighting blood comes from the veins of the Lord.<br/>And mark the nature of his armoury. His weapons are dispositions. He fights with “truth,” and “righteousness,” and “peace,” and “faith,” and “prayer”! There are no implements like these. A sword will fail where a courtesy will prevail. We can kill our enemies by kindness. And as for the devil himself there is nothing like a grace-filled disposition for putting him to flight! A prayerful disposition can drive him off any field, at any hour of the day or night. “Put on the whole armour of God.”
