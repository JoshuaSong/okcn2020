<B>SPEECH AS A SYMPTOM OF HEALTH</B>
<br/>
“The tongue of the wise is health.”
—<span>Pro 12:13-22</span>
<br/>
OUR doctors often test our physical condition by the state of our tongue. With another and deeper significance the tongue is also the register of our condition. Our words are a perfect index of our moral and spiritual health. If our words are unclean and untrue, our souls are assuredly sickly and diseased. A perverse tongue is never allied with a sanctified heart. And, therefore, everyone may apply a clinical test to his own life: “What is the character of my speech? What do my words indicate? What do they suggest as to the depths and background of the soul?” “By thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.”<br/>God delighteth in truthful lips. Right words are fruit from the tree of life. The Lord turns away from falsehood as we turn away from material corruption, only with an infinitely intenser loathing and disgust.<br/>It is only the lips that have been purified with flame from the holy altar of God that can offer words that are pleasing unto Him. <br/>
<br/>
“Take my lips and let them be
Filled with messages from Thee.” <br/>
