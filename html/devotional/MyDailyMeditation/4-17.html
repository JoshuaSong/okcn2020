<B>GREAT PRAISE</B>
<br/>
<span>1Ch 16:7-36</span>
<br/>
"GREAT is the Lord!” So many people have such a little God! There is nothing about Him august and sublime. And so He is not greatly praised. The worship is thin, the thanksgivings are scanty, the supplications are indifferent.<br/>All great saints have a great God. He fills their universe. Therefore do they move about in a fruitful awe, and everywhere there is only a thin veil between them and His appearing. Everywhere they discern His holy presence, as the face of a bride is dimly seen beneath her bridal veil. And so even the common scrub of the wilderness is aflame with sacred fire: the humble “primrose on the rock” becomes “the court of Deity”: and the “strength of the hills is His also”!<br/>Yes, a great God inspires great praise, and in great praise small cares and small meannesses are utterly consumed away. When praise is mean, anxieties multiply. Therefore let me contemplate the greatness of God in nature and in providence, in His power, and His holiness, and His love. Let me “stand in awe” before His glory: and in the fruitful reverence the soul will be moved in acceptable praise.<br/>
