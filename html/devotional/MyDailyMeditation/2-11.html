<B>THE HILL COUNTRY OF THE SOUL</B>
<br/>
<span>Psa 121:1-8</span>
<br/>
THERE should be a hill country in every life, some great up-towering peaks which dominate the common plain. There should be an upland district, where springs are born, and where rivers of inspiration have their birth. “I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills.”<br/>The soul that knows no hills is sure to be oppressed with the monotony of the road. The inspiration to do little things comes from the presence of big things. It is amazing what dull trifles we can get through when a radiant love is near. A noble companionship glorifies the dingiest road. And what if that Companion be God? Then, surely, “the common round and daily task” have a light thrown upon them from “the beauty of His countenance.”<br/>The “heavenlies” are our salvation and our defence. “His righteousness is like the great mountains.” “The mountains bring forth peace unto His people.”<br/>
