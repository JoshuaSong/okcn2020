<B>THE SICK AND THE LOST<br/>
</B><span>Eze 34:11-16</span><br/>
<br/>
SURELY everybody is included in this redemptive purpose of the Lord! He is looking for everybody, for everybody finds a place in His holy quest.<br/>He is seeking the “lost” sheep. The one that has wandered far away, and now no longer hears the sound of the Shepherd’s voice! The one that is carelessly nibbling the herbage on the very edge of perdition! He is looking for this one. Is He therefore looking for thee and me?<br/>He is seeking “that which was driven away.” Some hireling, some enemy of the shepherd, drove it far away from the fold. “A thief and a robber,” for his own purposes, hath done this. And the Lord’s sheep are driven away by “principalities and powers,” and by the violence of wicked men. Some impure and unworthy professor of religion can drive a whole household from the fellowship of the Church. And the Good Shepherd is seeking these. Is He therefore looking for thee or me?<br/>And He is seeking “that which was sick.” And some of the Lord’s sheep are sickly. The chill of disappointment, or failure, or bereavement has blown upon them, and they are “down.” Or they have been feeding on illicit pleasure. And the Lord is seeking such. Is He therefore seeking thee or me?
