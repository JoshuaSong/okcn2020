<B>ARMS AND THE MAN!
</B><br/>
<span>1Th 5:1-10</span><br/>
<br/>
WHAT wonderful armour is offered to me in which to meet the insidious assaults of the devil!<br/>There is “the armour of light.” Sunlight is the most sanative energy we know. It is the foe of many a deadly microbe which seeks a lodging in our bodies. Light is a splendid armour, even in the realm of the flesh. And so it is in the soul. If the soul is a home of light, the eternal light, evil germs will die as soon as they approach us. They will find nothing to breed on. “The prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me.”<br/>And there is the armour of “faith and love.” The opposite to faith is uncertainty, and the opposite to love is cynicism, and who does not know that uncertainty and cynicism are the very hotbeds for the machinations of the evil one? When faith is enthroned the soul is open to the reception of grace, and when love shares the throne the sovereignty is invincible.<br/>And there is the armour of “hope.” Even in a physical ailment a man has a mighty ally who wrestles in hope. And when a man’s hope is in the Lord his God all the powers in the heavenly places are his allies, and by his hope he shall be saved.
