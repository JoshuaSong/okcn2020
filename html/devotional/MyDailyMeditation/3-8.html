<B>THE CITIZENS OF THE HOME-LAND</B>
<br/>
<span>Rev 7:9-17</span>
<br/>
THE citizen of “the home-land” wears white robes. His habits are perfectly clean. And the purity which he wears is a Divine gift and not a human accomplishment. It cannot be attained by self-sacrifice; it is ours through the sacrifice of our Lord. “They have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.”<br/>And every citizen of the home-land bears a palm in his hand. It is the emblem of conquest and sovereignty. By the grace of Christ they have been lifted above self and sin, and the devil, and death, and “made to sit with Him” on His throne. The palm is the heavenly symbol that all their spiritual enemies are under their feet.<br/>And every citizen of the home-land takes part in the new song. The home-folk are therefore one in purity, one in self-conquest, and one in praise. “Salvation unto our God which sitteth upon the throne!” In that melody of thankfulness their union is deepened and enriched.<br/>And we, too, can begin now to wear the white robe! And even now can we carry the palm! And even now we can join in the song of ceaseless praise.
