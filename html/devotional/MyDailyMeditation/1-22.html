<B>MY OWN SHEPHERD<br/>
<br/>
</B><span>Psa 23:1-6</span><br/>

HOW shall we touch this lovely psalm and not bruise it? It is exquisite as “a violet by a mossy stone!” Exposition is almost an impertinence, its grace is so simple and winsome.<br/><b>There is the ministry of rest</b>. “He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.” The Good Shepherd knows when my spirit needs relaxation. He will not have me always “on the stretch.” The bow of the best violin sometimes requires to have its strings “let down.” And so my Lord gives me rest. <br/><b>And there is the discipline of change.</b> “He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness.” Those strange roads in life, unknown roads, by which I pass into changed circumstances and surroundings! But the discipline of the change is only to bring me into new pastures, that I may gain fresh nutriment for my soul. “Because they have no changes they fear not God.”<br/><b>And there is “the valley of the shadow,” cold and bare!</b> What matter? He is there! “I will fear no evil.” What if I see “no pastures green”? “Thy rod and Thy staff they comfort me!” The Lord, who is leading, will see after my food. “Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies.” I have a quiet feast while my foes are looking on!
