<B>THE ONLY WISE BEGINNING</B>
<br/>
“The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.”
—<span>Psa 111:1-10</span>
<br/>
IF I want to do anything wisely I must begin with God. That is the very alphabet of the matter. Every other beginning is a perverse beginning, and it will end in sure disaster. “I am Alpha.” Everything must take its rise in Him, or it will plunge from folly into folly, and culminate in confusion.<br/>If I would be wise in my daily business I must begin all my affairs in God. My career itself must be chosen in His presence, and in the illumination of His most holy Spirit. And in the subsequent days nothing must be done that is not rooted and grounded in Him.<br/>If I would be wise as a teacher I must begin with God. I must not merely call Him in to bless my lesson when my labour is done. The very beginnings of my thinkings must be in Him. Our Lord will not write an appendix to a volume about which He has never been consulted. “They who seek Me early shall find Me.” And so it is with the varied activities of our multitudinous life. If we would have them shine with quiet wisdom we must light them at the Sun of glory.<br/>
