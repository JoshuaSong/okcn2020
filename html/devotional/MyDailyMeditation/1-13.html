<B>THE MIRACLE IN A DRY PLACE<br/>
</B><br/>
<span>Psa 107:33-43</span>
<br/>
"HE turneth ... the dry ground into water-springs.” This is one of the miracles of grace. The good Lord makes a dry experience the fountain of blessing. I pass into an apparently waste place and I find riches of consolation. Even in “the valley of the shadow” I come upon “green pastures” and “still waters.” I find flowers in the ruts of the hardest roads if I am in “the way of God’s commandments.” God’s providence is the pioneer of every faithful pilgrim. His blessed feet have "gone before.” What I shall need is already foreseen, and foresight with the Lord means forethought and provision. Every hour gives the loyal disciples surprises of grace.<br/>Let me therefore not fear when the path of duty turns into the wilderness. The wilderness is as habitable with God as the crowded city, and in His fellowship my bread and water are sure. The Lord has strange manna for the children of disappointment, and He makes water to “gush forth from the rock.” Duty can lead me nowhere without Him, and His provision is abundant both in “the thirsty desert and the dewy mead.” There will be a spring at the foot of every hill, and I shall find “lilies of peace” in the lonely valley of humiliation.<br/>
