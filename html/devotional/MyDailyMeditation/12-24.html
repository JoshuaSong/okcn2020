<B>ENTERING IN AT LOWLY DOORS</B>
<br/>
“Unto us a Child is born.”
—<span>Isa 9:1-7</span>
<br/>
HOW gentle the coming! Who would have had sufficient daring of imagination to conceive that God Almighty would have appeared among men as a little child? We should have conceived something sensational, phenomenal, catastrophic, appalling! The most awful of the natural elements would have formed His retinue, and men would be chilled and frozen with fear. But He came as a little child. The great God “emptied Himself”; He let in the light as our eyes were able to bear it.<br/>“Unto us a Son is given.” And that is the superlative gift! The love that bestows such gift is all-complete and gracious. And the Son is given in order that we may all be born into sonship. It is the Son’s ministry to make sons. “Now are we the sons of God,” and we are of His creation.

“Lord, I would serve, and be a son;
Dismiss me not, I pray.”<br/>
