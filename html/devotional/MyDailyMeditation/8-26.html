<B>MISSING THE LORD<br/>
</B>“Thou knowest not the time of thy visitation.”
—<span>Luk 19:37-44</span><br/>
YES, that has been my sad experience. I have wasted some of my wealthiest seasons. I have treated the hour as common and worthless, and the priceless opportunity has passed.<br/>There have been times when my Lord has come to me, and I have turned Him away from my door. He so often journeys “incognito,” and if I am thoughtless I dismiss Him, and so lose the privilege of heavenly communion and benediction. He knocks at my door as a Carpenter, and the humble attire deceives me, and I treat Him with scant courtesy, and sometimes with contempt. I know not the time of my visitation.<br/>He comes to me in the guise of needy people—as sick, or hungry, or a stranger, and I cannot be troubled with His presence. I dismissed Him as a pauper, little knowing that I was turning away a millionaire! I knew not the time of my visitation! “I was an hungered, and ye gave Me no meat,” and so we missed the bread of life.<br/>And so there is nothing for it, but to be always “on the watch.” I must treat everybody as though everybody was the Christ. And I must treat every commonplace moment as though it were the home of the eternal.
