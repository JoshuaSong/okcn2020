<B>HEALTHY LISTENING</B>
<br/>
“Be ye doers of the word and not hearers only.”
<span>Jam 1:21-27</span><br/>

WHEN we hear the word, but do not do it, there has been a defect in our hearing. We may listen to the word for mere entertainment. Or we may attach a virtue to the mere act of listening to the word. We may assume that some magical efficacy belongs to the mere reading of the word. And all this is perverse and delusive. No listening is healthy which is not mentally referred to obedience. We are to listen with a view to obedience, with our eyes upon the very road where the obedient feet will travel. That is to say, we are to listen with purpose, as though we were Ambassadors receiving instructions from the King concerning some momentous mission. Yes, we must listen with an eye on the road.<br/>“Doing” makes a new thing of “hearing.” The statute obeyed becomes a song. The commandment is found to be a beatitude. The decree discloses riches of grace. The hidden things of God are not discovered until we are treading the path of obedience. “And it came to pass that as he went he received his sight.” In the way of obedience the blind man found a new world. God has wonderful treasures for the dutiful. The faithful discover the “hidden manna.”
