<B>THE MAKING OF A BRAVE MAN</B>
<br/>
<span>Act 4:13-22</span>.
<br/>
HERE is a marvellous transformation! I have been wondering at the littleness of the denier, and now this same denier is making the world wonder by his majestic boldness! His one resource is now the risen Christ, and his one moral standard is “whether it be right!” Once he quailed before an accusing maid; now he stands undaunted before the rulers of the earth. How has it all come about?<br/>He has been to the empty tomb. The awe of the resurrection is upon his spirit. Through the once blind cul-de-sac of the grave he has seen the King and the great white throne.<br/>And he has been by the lake on the morning of reconciliation. The live coal from the altar of his Lord’s love has touched him and has purged away the uncleanness of his denial.<br/>And he has been in the upper room at Pentecost, and the mighty Spirit has come upon him like wind and flame, endowing him with forceful and enthusiastic character. Now he can dare for God, now he can work for God, now he can burn for God! And this is how he has been transformed.<br/>
