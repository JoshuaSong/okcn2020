<B>EXHILARANT SPIRITS
</B><br/>
“He maketh my feet like hinds’ feet.”
—<span>Psa 18:31-39</span>
<br/>
THINK of Wordsworth’s lines, in which he describes a natural lady, made by Nature herself:<br/>
She shall be sportive as the fawn
That wild with glee across the lawn
Or up the mountain springs.<br/>
And it is this buoyancy, this elasticity, this springiness that the Lord is waiting to impart to the souls of His children, so that they may move along the ways of life with the light steps of the fawn.<br/>Some of us move with very heavy feet. There is little of the fawn about us as we go along the road. There is reluctance in our obedience. There is a frown in our homage. Our benevolence is graceless, and there is no charm in our piety, and no rapture in our praise. We are the victims of “the spirit of heaviness.” And yet here is the word which tells us that God will make our feet “like hinds’ feet.” He will give us exhilaration and spring, enabling us to leap over difficulties, and to have strength and buoyancy for the steepest hills. Let us seek the inspiration of the Lord. “It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect.”
