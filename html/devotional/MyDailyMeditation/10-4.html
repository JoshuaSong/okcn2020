<B>CREATOR AND CREATURE<br/>
</B><span>Isa 40:9-28<br/>
</span><br/>
LET me mark the range of this teaching. “Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of His hand.... He shall feed His flock like a shepherd.” And let me mark it again. “The Creator of the ends of the earth ... giveth power unto the faint.” Almightiness offers itself to carry my burden! The Creator offers Himself to re-create me! I can engage the forces of the universe to help me on my journey. Emerson counselled us to hitch our wagon to a star. We can do better than that. We can hitch it to the Maker of the star! We have something better than an ideal; we have the Light of the world. We are not left to a radiant abstraction; we have a gracious God.<br/>The water flows from the Welsh hills to every house in Birmingham. Rich and poor alike share the bounty of the mountains. The wealth of the mountains comes to the common thirst. And everybody, too, may have the water from the everlasting hills. “The water that I shall give him shall be in him.” The river of life will flow to every soul of man.
