<B>THE SONS OF GOD<br/>
</B>“For as many as are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God.”
<span>Rom 8:9-17</span><br/>
AND how unspeakably wealthy are the implications of the great word!<br/>If a son, then what holy freedom is mine! Mine is not “the spirit of bondage.” The son has “the run of the house.” That is the great contrast between lodgings and home. And I am to be at home with the Lord.<br/>And if a son, then heir! “All things are yours.” Samuel Rutherford used to counsel his friends to “take a turn” round their estate. And truly it is an inspiring exercise! The Spirit shall lead me over my estate, and I will survey, with the sense of ownership, “the things which God hath prepared for them that love Him.”<br/>I wonder if I have the manner of a king’s son? I wonder if there is anything in my very “walk” which indicates distinguished lineage and royal blood? Or am I like a vagrant who has no possessions and no heartening expectations?<br/>
“Lord, I would serve, and be a son!” <br/>
