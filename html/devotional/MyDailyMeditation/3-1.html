<B>OVERCHARGING THE HEART</B>
<br/>
<span>Luk 21:25-36</span>
<br/>
HERE is a great peril. Our hearts may be “overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares.” Our mode of living may send our spirits to sleep. Yes, we may so ill-use our bodies that the watchman sleeps at his post! We can over-eat, and dim our moral sight. A man’s daily meals have vital relationship with his vision of the Lord. If I would have a clear spirit I must not overburden the flesh.<br/>And therefore am I bidden to “take heed” to myself. I must exercise common sense, the most important of all the senses. I must put a bridle upon my appetite, and hold it in subjection to my Lord.<br/>And I must “watch!” The devil is surpassingly cunning, and, if he can, he will mix an opiate even with the sacramental wine. He will lure me among the winsome poppies, and put me into a perilous sleep.<br/>And I must “pray!” I have a great and glorious Defender! Let me humbly yet confidently use Him, and I shall be delivered from the snares of appetite, and from the benumbing influence of all excess.
