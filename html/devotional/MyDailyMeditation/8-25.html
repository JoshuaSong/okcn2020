<B>IMPOTENT ENEMIES<br/>
</B>“Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?”
—<span>Rom 8:31-39</span><br/>
WHO can get between the love of Christ and me? What sharp dividing minister can cleave the two in twain, and leave me like a dismembered and dying branch?<br/>Terrible experiences cannot do it. “Tribulation, distress, persecution, famine, nakedness, peril, or sword!” All these may come about my house, but they cannot reach the inner sanctuary where my Lord and I are closeted in loving communion and peace. They may bruise my skin, nay, they may give my body to be burned, but no flame can destroy the love of Jesus which enswathes my soul with invisible defence.<br/>And terrible ministers cannot do it. “Angels, nor principalities, nor powers.” These mysterious agents of darkness, for they must be the legions of the evil one, are unable to quench the light and fire of my Saviour’s love. The devil can never blow out the lamp of grace.<br/>And terrible death itself cannot do it. Death does not separate me from Jesus; death is the Lord’s minister to lead me into deeper privilege and ripe experiences of grace and love. Therefore, “I will lay me down in peace, and take my rest.”<br/>
