<B>THE STRANGER<br/>
</B><span>1Ki 8:37-53</span><br/>
YES, indeed, what space has “the stranger” in my supplications? Has he any place at all? Are my intercessions private enclosures, intended only for the select among my friends? Do I ever open the door to anyone outside my family circle? Are my ecclesiastical sympathies large enough to include “outsiders” from afar? What do I do with “the stranger”?<br/>There is nothing which keeps prayer sweet and fresh and wholesome like the letting in of “the stranger”! To let a new guest sit down at the feast of my intercession is to give my own soul a most nutritious surprise. It is a most healthy spiritual habit to see to it that we bring in a new “stranger” every time we pray. Let me be continually enlarging the circle of hospitality! Let some new and weary bird find a resting-place in the branches of my supplications every time I hold communication with God.<br/>A prayer which has no room for “the stranger” can have little or no room for God.
