<B>THE SPEECH OF THE INCARNATION</B>
<br/>
“He hath spoken to us in His Son.”
—<span>Heb 1:1-14</span>
<br/>
AND that blessed Son spake my language. He came into my troubled conditions and expressed Himself out of my humble lot. My surroundings afforded Him a language in which He made known His good news. The carpenter’s shop, the shepherd on the hill, the ladened vine, a wayside well, common bread, a friend’s sickness, the desolation of a garden, the darkness of “the last things”—these all offered Him a mode of speech in which He unveiled to me the heart of God.<br/>He came as the Son to make me a son. For I had made myself a slave, and called my bondage freedom. I wore my badge of servitude with unholy pride. But when He came and spake to me, my lost inheritance dawned upon my wondering eyes, and I knew myself to be enslaved. But His was the glorious mission not only to awake but to emancipate, not only to unveil lost splendour but to recover it. He came to set us free, “and if the Son shall make you free ye shall be free indeed.”<br/>“This my son was lost and is found.” Has that great word been spoken concerning me in the Father’s home of light? “Lord, I would serve, and be a son. Dismiss me not, I pray.”<br/>
