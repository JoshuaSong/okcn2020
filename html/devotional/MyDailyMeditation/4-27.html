<B>OBSCURE BIRTHPLACES</B>
<br/>
<span>1Sa 17:12-27</span>
<br/>
GOD’S champion is at present feeding sheep! Who would have expected that Goliath’s antagonist would emerge from the quiet pastures? “Genius hatches her offspring in strange places.” Very humble homes are the birthplaces of mighty emancipations.<br/>There was a little farm at St. Ives, and the farmer lived a quiet and unsensational life. But the affairs of the nation became more and more confused and threatening. Monarchical power despoiled the people’s liberties, and tyranny became rampant. And out from the little farm strode Oliver Cromwell, the ordained of God, to emancipate his country.<br/>There was an obscure rectory at Epworth. The doings in the little rectory were just the quiet practices of similar homes in countless parts of England. And England was becoming brutalized, because its religious life was demoralized. The Church was asleep, and the devil was wide awake! And forth from the humble rectory strode John Wesley, the appointed champion of the Lord to enthuse, to purify, and to sweeten the life of the people.<br/>On what quiet farm is the coming deliverer now labouring? Who knows?
