<B>SATISFACTION<br/>
</B>“My people shall be satisfied with My goodness.”
—<span>Jer 31:10-14</span><br/>
<br/>
AND how unlike is all this to the feasts of the world! There is a great show, but no satisfaction. There is much decorative china, but no nutritious food or drink. “Every one that drinketh of this water shall thirst again.” We rise from the table, and our deepest cravings are unappeased. “Why art thou cast down, O my soul?” We know. We have had a condiment, but no meat; a showy menu-card, but no reviving feast.<br/>Nothing but the goodness of the Lord can satisfy the soul. Whatever else may be on the table of life, if this be absent we shall go away unfed. We may have money, and pleasure, and success, and fame, but they are all delusive husks if the grace of the Lord be absent.<br/>This is the real furnishing of the feast. There are vast multitudes of things I can do without if only I have the holy bread of life in the gracious Presence of my Lord. In this sphere it is the Guest who makes the table! “Thou, O Christ, art all I want!” “Having Him we have all things.” A glorious satisfaction possesses the soul, and though we may not increase our worldly possessions, we do something better, we “grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.”
