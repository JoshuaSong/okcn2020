<B>FEEDING THE FLOCK<br/>
</B><span>Isa 40:1-11</span><br/>
<br/>
HERE is the gracious promise of provision. “He shall feed His flock like a Shepherd.” He knows the fields where my soul will be best nourished in holiness. I am sometimes amazed at His choice. He takes me into an apparent wilderness, but I find rich herbage on the unpromising plain. And so I would rest in His choice even when it seems adverse to my good.<br/>And here is the gracious promise of gentle discrimination. “He shall gather the lambs in His arm, and carry them in His bosom.” Says old Trapp, “He hath a great care of His little ones, like as He had of the weaker tribes. In their march through the Wilderness He put a strong tribe to two weak tribes, lest they should faint or fail.” Yes, “He knoweth our frame.” He will not lay upon us more than we can bear. At the back of every commandment there is a promise of adequate resource. His askings are also His enablings. The big duty means that we shall have a big lift. And when we are tired He will lead on gently. Such is the grace and tenderness of the Lord.
