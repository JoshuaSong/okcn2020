<B>THE LORD AS A FRIEND</B>
<br/>
<span>Joh 15:8-17</span>
<br/>
YE are my friends!”<br/>In my Lord’s friendship there is the ministry of sacrifice. “Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.” This great Friend is always giving His blood. It is a lasting shame when professed Christians are afflicted with spiritual anþ6mia. And yet we are often so fearful, so white-faced, so chicken-hearted, so averse from battle, that no one would think us to be “the soldiers of the Lord.” We need blood. “Except ye drink my blood ye have no life.”<br/>And in my Lord’s friendship there is the privilege of most intimate communion.<br/>“All things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.” He takes us into His confidence, and tells us His secrets. It is His delight to lift the veil, and give us constant surprises of love and grace. He discovers flowers in desert places, and in the gloom He unbosoms “the treasures of darkness.” He is a Friend of inexhaustible resource, and His companionship makes the pilgrim’s way teem with interest, and abound in the wonders of redeeming grace.
