<B>WHAT ABOUT TO-MORROW?<br/>
</B><span>Jos 24:1-15</span><br/>
IT is not mine to worry about the coming day, but to fill the immediate moment with radiant duty. My Lord is the Pioneer, the great Maker of roads, and He will see to the appointments and provisions of the way. He has His scouts, His advance guard, His miners and sappers opening the highway across the waste! “I will send mine angel before thee!” “I will send hornets before you!” Yes, the Lord will look after the road. What, then, am I called to do? Let me find the answer in 14th verse.<br/>“Fear the Lord!”<b> </b>The Lord must be the sovereign thought in my life. All true and well-proportioned living must begin in well-proportioned thought. God must be my biggest thought, and from that thought all others must take their colour and their range.<br/>“Put away the gods.” My supreme homage must not be shared among many, it must be given to One. When the Lord is enthroned as King all usurpers must be banished. When He comes to His own the others go into exile.<br/>“Serve ye the Lord.” My strength must be enlisted with my loyalty. I must not merely shout; I must work. I must not merely clap my hands when the King goes by, I must consecrate those hands in sacrificial service.
