<B>THROUGH DEATH TO LIFE</B>
<br/>
<span>Rom 5:1-11</span><br/>

THE Lord went through death to make a path to life. He descended into shame and suffering, and appalling desolation in order that He might “open the Kingdom of Heaven to all believers.” And the way is now open!<br/>Therefore, “let us have peace with God.” Let us reverently and willingly tread the heavenly road, and seek the King’s presence, and gratefully accept “the everlasting covenant.” Let us go, as once rebel soldiers, and let us surrender our arms, and at His bidding take them again, to fight in His service.<br/>And let us “glory in tribulation.” If we are in the King’s road, at peace with the King, every stormy circumstance will be made to do us service. Yes, all our troubles will be compelled to minister to us, to robe us, and to adorn us, and to make us more like the sons and daughters of a royal house. “Out of the eater will come forth meat, and out of the strong will come forth sweetness.”<br/>And, therefore, let us “joy in God.” Don’t let us be “the King’s own,” and yet march in the sulks! Let us march to the music of grateful song and praise. <br/>
<br/>
“Children of the heavenly King,
As ye journey, sweetly sing.” <br/>
