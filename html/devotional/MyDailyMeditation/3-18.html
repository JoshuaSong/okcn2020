<B>SERENITY IN THE TEMPEST</B>
<br/>
<span>Job 19:23-27</span>
<br/>
PERHAPS I am akin to Job in having experienced the pressure of calamity. I have felt the shock of adverse circumstances, and the house of my life has trembled in the convulsion. Or death has been to my door and has returned again and again, and every time he has left me weeping! All God’s billows have gone over me! Verily, I can take my place by the patriarch Job.<br/>But can I share his witness, “I know that my Redeemer liveth”? Have I a calm assurance that my ruler is not caprice, and that my comings and goings are not determined by unfeeling chance? When death knocked at my door, did I know that the King had sent him? When some cherished scheme toppled into ruin, had I any thought that the Lord’s hand was concerned in the shaking? Even when my circumstances are dubious, and I cannot trace a gracious purpose, do I know that my Vindicator liveth, and that some day He will justify all the happenings of the troubled road?<br/>I will pay for this gracious confidence. I would have a firm step even among disappointments; yea, I would “sing songs in the night!”
