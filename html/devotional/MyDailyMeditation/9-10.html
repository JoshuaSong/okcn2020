<B>CRITICISM AND PIETY<br/>
</B>“Thinkest thou, that judgest them that do such things, that thou shalt escape?”
—<span>Rom 2:1-11</span><br/>
THAT is always my peril, to assume that by being severe with others I exculpate myself. I go on to the bench, and deliver sentence upon my brother, when my proper place is in the dock. And this is the subtlety of the snare, that I regard my criticisms and condemnations of other people as signs of my own innocence. This is the last refinement in temptation, and multitudes fall before its power.<br/>The way to moral and spiritual health is to direct my criticisms upon myself. I must stand in the dock, and hear the grave indictment of my own soul. Unless I pass through the second chapter of Romans I can never enter the fifth and sixth, and still less the glorious forgiveness of the eighth. “There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus.” I pass into that warm, cheery light through the cold road of acknowledged guilt and sin.<br/>“If we confess our sins He is just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”
