<div><article>Mood-Imperative 
<br /> 
<br /> The imperative mood corresponds to the English imperative, and 
<br /> expresses a command to the hearer to perform a certain action 
<br /> by the order and authority of the one commanding.  Thus, 
<br /> Jesus' phrase, "Repent ye, and believe the gospel" Mr 1:15 
<br /> is not at all an "invitation, " but an absolute command 
<br /> requiring full obedience on the part of all hearers.
