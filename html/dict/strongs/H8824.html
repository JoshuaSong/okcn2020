<br /> 
<br /> This Hebrew form is equivalent in use to the Hithpael,  and is 
<br /> causative/reflexive in meaning.  The separate term occurs because 
<br /> certain verb forms reduplicate their final consonant and change into 
<br /> a quadriliteral (4-letter) root rather than the normal triliteral 
<br /> (3-letter) root form.  This form additionally lengthens the initial 
<br /> vowel in the first consonant.
