<br /> 
<br /> It is only in a part of their meanings that these two words are in any 
<br /> real sense synonymous, and it is that part which is here considered. 
<br /> Both A.V. and R.V. often translate aion by world, thus 
<br /> obscuring the distinction between it and kosmos. aion is 
<br /> usually better expressed by age, it is the world at a given time, a 
<br /> particular period in the world's history. 
<br /> 
<br /> kosmos has very frequently an unfavorable meaning, denoting the 
<br /> inhabitants of the world, mankind in general, as opposed to God. A 
<br /> similar meaning is often attached to aion, it means the spirit of 
<br /> the age, often in an unfavorable sense. See Eph 2:2, where both 
<br /> words occur together. An exceptional meaning for the plural of aion 
<br /> is found in Heb 1:2  11:3, where it denotes the worlds, apparently 
<br /> in reference to space rather than time.
