<br /> neos is the new as contemplated under the aspect of time, that 
<br /> which has recently come into existence. 
<br /> 
<br /> kainos is the new under the aspect of quality, that which has 
<br /> not seen service. kainos therefore often means new as contrasted 
<br /> with that which has decayed with age, or is worn out, its opposite then 
<br /> being palaios. It sometimes suggests that which is unusual.  It 
<br /> often implies praise, the new as superior to the old. Occasionally, on 
<br /> the other hand, it implies the opposite, the new as inferior to that 
<br /> which is old, because the old is familiar or because it has improved 
<br /> with age. Of course it is evident that both neos and kainos may 
<br /> sometimes be applied to the same object, but from different points of 
<br /> view.
