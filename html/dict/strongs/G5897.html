<br /> 
<br /> According to their derivation, synagoge is simply an assembly, 
<br /> a mass of people gathered together? 
<br /> 
<br /> ekklesia is a narrower word, also an assembly, but including 
<br /> only those specially called together out of a larger multitude, 
<br /> for the transaction of business. ekklesia usually denotes a 
<br /> somewhat more select company than synagoge. A significant use of 
<br /> ekklesia in strict harmony with its derivation was common among 
<br /> the Greeks. It was their common word for the lawful assembly in a free 
<br /> Greek city of all those possessing the rights of citizenship, for the 
<br /> transaction of public affairs.  They were summoned out of the 
<br /> whole population, ``a select portion of it, including neither the 
<br /> populace, nor strangers, nor yet those who had forfeited their civic 
<br /> rights''(Trench).  synagoge had been, before N.T. times, 
<br /> appropriated to designate a synagogue, a Jewish assembly for worship, 
<br /> distinct from the Temple, in which sense it is used in the N.T. 
<br /> Probably for that reason, and also for its greater inherent 
<br /> etymological fitness, ekklesia is the word taken to designate 
<br /> a Christian church, a company of believers who meet for worship. 
<br /> Both these words, however, are sometimes used in the N.T. in a 
<br /> non-technical sense. 
<br /> 
<br /> panegyris, occurring only in Heb 12:23, differs from both, 
<br /> denoting a solemn assembly for festal rejoicing.
