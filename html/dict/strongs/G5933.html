<br /> 
<br /> idea denotes merely outward appearance. 
<br /> 
<br /> Both morphe and schema express something more than that. They too 
<br /> denote outward form, but as including one's habits, activities and 
<br /> modes of action in general. In morphe it is also implied that the 
<br /> outward form expresses the inner essence, an idea which is absent from 
<br /> schema. morphe expresses the form as that which is intrinsic and 
<br /> essential, schema signifies the figure, shape, as that which is more 
<br /> outward and accidental. Both schema and idea therefore deal with 
<br /> externals, schema being more comprehensive than idea, while 
<br /> morphe deals with externals as expressing that which is internal.
