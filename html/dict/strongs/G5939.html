<br /> These words in the N.T. are used with an evident purpose to 
<br /> discriminate between them. The distinction, however, does not seem to 
<br /> have been chiefly one of size, as some have thought, but of use. 
<br /> spyris is usually a basket for food, a lunch-basket, a hamper, 
<br /> while kophinos is a more general term for basket. The 
<br /> descriptions of the two miracles of feeding the multitude use always 
<br /> different words in the two cases, see e.g. Mr 8:19,20.
