<div><article>Voice-Middle 
<br /> 
<br /> The middle voice indicates the subject performing an action 
<br /> upon himself (reflexive action) or for his own benefit.  E.g., 
<br /> "The boy groomed himself."  Many verbs which occur only in 
<br /> middle voice forms are translated in English as having an 
<br /> active sense; these are called "deponent" verbs, and do not 
<br /> comply with the normal requirements for the middle voice.
