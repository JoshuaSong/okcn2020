<br /> 
<br /> Both words may be translated gentleness, yet there are marked 
<br /> differences in meaning. praotes is rather passive, denoting, as 
<br /> has been said above (see Humility, Gentleness), one's attitude toward 
<br /> others in view of their acts, bad or good. 
<br /> 
<br /> epieikeia is distinctly active, it is seen in one's deeds toward 
<br /> others, and it usually implies the relation of superior to inferior. 
<br /> It is fundamentally a relaxing of strict legal requirements concerning 
<br /> others, yet doing this in order more fully to carry out the real 
<br /> spirit of the law. It is clemency in which there is no element of 
<br /> weakness or injustice.
