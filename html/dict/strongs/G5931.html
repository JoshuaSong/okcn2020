<br /> 
<br /> thalassa is the more general word, indicating the sea or 
<br /> ocean as contrasted with the land or shore. It may be applied to 
<br /> small bodies of water. 
<br /> 
<br /> pelagos is the open sea, the uninterrupted expanse of water, in 
<br /> contrast with the portions broken by islands or with partly inclosed 
<br /> bays.  The prominent thought is said by Trench to be breadth rather 
<br /> than depth.  Noteworthy is the distinction between the two words in 
<br /> Mt 18:6.
