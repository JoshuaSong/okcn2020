<div><article>Qere Readings 
<br /> 
<br /> In the Hebrew Bible,  the scribes did not alter any text they felt had been copied incorrectly. Rather they noted in the margin what they thought the written text should be. The written variation is called a kethiv and the marginal note is called the qere. Where the translators of the Authorised Version followed the kethiv reading rather than the qere,  we indicate the qere reading by the number 08676. For example,  in De 19:6  "blood" is coded as  { [<a class="strongs" href="/strongs/H1818">H1818</a>]} 08676  { [<a class="strongs" href="/strongs/H5315">H5315</a>]}. The translators followed the kethiv reading that has Strong's number  { [<a class="strongs" href="/strongs/H1818">H1818</a>]},  which means "blood",  but the qere reading is Strong's number  { [<a class="strongs" href="/strongs/H5315">H5315</a>]},  which means "life".
