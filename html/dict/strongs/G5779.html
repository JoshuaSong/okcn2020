<div><article>Tense-Pluperfect 
<br /> 
<br /> The pluperfect tense in Greek occurs rarely.  It corresponds 
<br /> in a single Greek word to the sense of the English pluperfect, 
<br /> which indicates an event viewed as having been once and for 
<br /> all accomplished in past time.  In contrast, the perfect tense 
<br /> reflects the final completion of an action at the present 
<br /> moment described. 
<br /> 
<br /> In translation the Greek pluperfect may not always follow the 
<br /> rendering of the English pluperfect, due to excessive wordiness. 
<br /> The English pluperfect is normally formed with the past tense 
<br /> of the "helping" verbs "to have" or "to be, " plus the past 
<br /> participle, e.g., "He had finished."   The English perfect 
<br /> is formed by the present tense of the helping verb plus the 
<br /> past participle, e.g., "He has finished."
