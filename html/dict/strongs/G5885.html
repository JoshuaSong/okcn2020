<br /> 
<br /> alazon is properly a boaster, who tells great things 
<br /> concerning his own prowess and achievements, with the implied idea 
<br /> that many of his claims are false. This word naturally describes a 
<br /> trait which manifests itself in contact with one's fellow men, not one 
<br /> which exists simply within the heart. 
<br /> 
<br /> yperephanos describes one who thinks too highly of himself, 
<br /> describing a trait which is simply internal, not referring primarily 
<br /> to external manifestation, although this is implied. It means one who 
<br /> is proud, the external manifestation when it appears being in the 
<br /> form of arrogance in dealing with others. 
<br /> 
<br /> ypristes describes one who delights in insolent wrong-doing 
<br /> toward others, finds pleasure in such acts. Cruelty and lust are two 
<br /> of the many forms which this quality assumes. These three words occur 
<br /> together in Ro 1:30.  They are never used in a good sense. They 
<br /> may be said to move in a certain sense in an ascending scale of guilt, 
<br /> designating respectively "the boastful in words, the proud and 
<br /> overbearing in thoughts, the insolent and injurious in acts " 
<br /> (Cremer).
