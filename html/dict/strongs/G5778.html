<div><article>Tense-Perfect 
<br /> 
<br /> The perfect tense in Greek corresponds to the perfect tense in 
<br /> English, and describes an action which is viewed as having been 
<br /> completed in the past, once and for all, not needing to be 
<br /> repeated. 
<br /> 
<br /> Jesus' last cry from the cross, TETELESTAI ("It is finished!") 
<br /> is a good example of the perfect tense used in this sense, 
<br /> namely "It [the atonement] has been accomplished, completely, 
<br /> once and for all time." 
<br /> 
<br /> Certain antiquated verb forms in Greek, such as those related 
<br /> to seeing (eidw) or knowing (oida) will use the perfect tense 
<br /> in a manner equivalent to the normal past tense.  These few 
<br /> cases are exception to the normal rule and do not alter the 
<br /> normal connotation of the perfect tense stated above.
