<br /> 
<br /> The Roman system of collecting taxes, especially the teloi, in 
<br /> their provinces, included ordinarily three grades of officials. There 
<br /> was the highest, called in Latin publicanus, who paid a sum of 
<br /> money for the taxes of a certain province, and then exacted that and as 
<br /> much more as he could from the province. This man lived in Rome. Then 
<br /> there were the submagistri, who had charge each of a certain 
<br /> portion of territory, and who lived in the provinces. Then there were 
<br /> the portitores, the actual custom-house officers, who did the real 
<br /> work of collecting the taxes. The N.T. word telones is used to 
<br /> describe one of the portitores ? it is the lowest of these three 
<br /> grades. It does not correspond to the Latin publicanus, and the 
<br /> word publican used to translate it in A.V. and R.V. is apt to be 
<br /> misleading? tax-collector would be better. 
<br /> 
<br /> architelones, only occurring in Lu 19:2, evidently describes a 
<br /> higher official than telones, and is probably one of the 
<br /> submagistri, the next higher grade.
