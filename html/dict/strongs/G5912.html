<br /> 
<br /> sarkikos means phleselth, that which is controlled by the wrong 
<br /> desires which rule in the flesh, flesh often being understood in its 
<br /> broad sense, see sarx. It describes a man who gives the flesh the 
<br /> dominion in his life, a place which does not belong to it by right. It 
<br /> means distinctly opposed to the Spirit of God, anti-spiritual. 
<br /> 
<br /> sarkinos properly means fleshy, made of flesh, flesh being the 
<br /> material of which it is composed. When given a bad meaning, however, it 
<br /> is plainly similar to sarkikos, but according to Trench not so 
<br /> strong, denoting one as unspiritual, undeveloped, rather than anti- 
<br /> spiritual.  Others, as Cremer and Thayer, with more probability make 
<br /> sarkinos the stronger, it describes one who is flesh, wholly given 
<br /> up to the flesh, rooted in the flesh, rather than one who simply acts 
<br /> according to the flesh (sarkikos). There is much confusion between 
<br /> the two in the N.T. manuscripts. 
<br /> 
<br /> psychikos has a meaning somewhat similar to sarkikos. Both are 
<br /> used in contrast with pneumatikos. But psychikos has really a 
<br /> distinct meaning, describing the life which is controlled by the 
<br /> psyche.  It denotes, therefore, that which belongs to the animal 
<br /> life, or that which is controlled simply by the appetites and passions 
<br /> of the sensuous nature.
