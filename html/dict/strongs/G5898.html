<br /> 
<br /> tapeinophrosyne is humility, not the making of one's self small 
<br /> when he is really great, but thinking little of one's self, because 
<br /> this is in a sense the right estimate for any human being, however 
<br /> great. 
<br /> 
<br /> praotes is founded upon this idea, and goes beyond it. It is the 
<br /> attitude of mind and behavior which, arising from humility, disposes 
<br /> one to receive with gentleness and meekness whatever may come 
<br /> to him from others or from God.
