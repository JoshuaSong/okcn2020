<br /> 
<br /> The fundamental idea of asotia is "wastefulness and riotous 
<br /> excess? of aselgeia, lawless insolence and wanton caprice" 
<br /> (Trench). asotia means reckless and extravagant expenditure, 
<br /> chiefly for the gratification of one's sensual desires. It denotes a 
<br /> dissolute, profligate course of life. In aselgeis also there is 
<br /> included the idea of profligacy, often of lasciviousness, but the 
<br /> fundamental thought is the acknowledging of no restraints, the 
<br /> insolent doing of whatever one's caprice may suggest.
