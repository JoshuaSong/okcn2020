<br /> 
<br /> aphthartos is properly incorruptible, unaffected by corruption 
<br /> and decay.  It is applied to God, and to that which is connected with 
<br /> him. 
<br /> 
<br /> amarantos expresses the same idea in another way. It means 
<br /> unfading, the root idea being that it is unaffected by the 
<br /> withering which is common in the case of flowers. 
<br /> 
<br /> amarantinos, derived from amarantos, means composed of 
<br /> amaranths, i.e, of unfading flowers.
