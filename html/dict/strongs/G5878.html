<br /> 
<br /> None of these words in classical Greek has necessarily any moral 
<br /> significance. Those which now have such a meaning have developed it in 
<br /> Biblical Greek. 
<br /> 
<br /> ieros means sacred, implying some special relation to God, so 
<br /> that it may not be violated. It refers, however, to formal relation 
<br /> rather than to character. It designates an external relation, which 
<br /> ordinarily is not an internal relation as well. It is used to describe 
<br /> persons or things. This is the commonest word for holy in 
<br /> classical Greek, and expresses their usual conception of holiness, but 
<br /> it is rare in the N.T. because it fails to express the fullness of the 
<br /> N.T. conception. 
<br /> 
<br /> osios, used of persons or things, describes that which is in 
<br /> harmony with the divine constitution of the moral universe. Hence, it 
<br /> is that which is in accordance with the general and instinctively felt 
<br /> idea of right, "what is consecrated and sanctioned by universal law 
<br /> and consent" (Passow), rather than what is in accordance with any 
<br /> system of revealed truth. As contrary to osios, i.e., as 
<br /> anosia, the Greeks regarded, e.g., a marriage between brother 
<br /> and sister such as was common in Egypt, or the omission of the rites 
<br /> of sepulture in connection with a relative. agios has probably as 
<br /> its fundamental meaning separation, i.e., from the world to God's 
<br /> service. If not the original meaning, this at any rate is a meaning 
<br /> early in use. This separation, however, is not chiefly external, it is 
<br /> rather a separation from evil and defilement.  The moral signification 
<br /> of the word is therefore the prominent one.  This word, rare and of 
<br /> neutral meaning in classical Greek, has been developed in meaning, so 
<br /> that it expresses the full N.T. conception of holiness as no other 
<br /> does. 
<br /> 
<br /> agnos is probably related to agios. It means specifically 
<br /> pure.  But this may be only in a ceremonial sense, or it may have 
<br /> a moral signification. It sometimes describes freedom from 
<br /> impurities of the flesh.
