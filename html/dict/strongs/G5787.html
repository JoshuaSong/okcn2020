<div><article>Voice-Either Middle or Passive 
<br /> 
<br /> Many of the so-called "deponent" verbs can have either a 
<br /> middle or passive form.  These are normally translated as 
<br /> having an active voice, since they have no active form in 
<br /> their outward spelling.  At times, however, they retain their 
<br /> middle or passive significance.
