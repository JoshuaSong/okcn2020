<br /> These words form a series. phyle is sometimes a race, nation, 
<br /> but usually a tribe, such as one of the twelve tribes of Israel, 
<br /> descended from the twelve sons of Jacob. 
<br /> 
<br /> patria is a smaller division within the tribe, it's an association 
<br /> of families closely related, in the N.T. generally used of those 
<br /> descended from a particular one of the sons of Jacob's sons. 
<br /> 
<br /> oikos is yet narrower, household, including all the inmates of 
<br /> a single house, being the unit of organization.
