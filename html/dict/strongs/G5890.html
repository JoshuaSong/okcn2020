<br /> 
<br /> pseudochristos means a false Christ, a pretended Messiah, who 
<br /> sets himself up instead of Christ, proclaiming that he is Christ. 
<br /> 
<br /> Some have given about the same meaning to antichristos. But it is 
<br /> much more probable that it means one diametrically opposed to Christ, 
<br /> one who sets himself up against Christ, proclaiming that there is no 
<br /> Christ.
