<div><article>Mood-Subjunctive 
<br /> 
<br /> The subjunctive mood is the mood of possibility and 
<br /> potentiality.  The action described may or may not occur, 
<br /> depending upon circumstances.  Conditional sentences of the 
<br /> third class ("ean" + the subjunctive) are all of this type, as 
<br /> well as many commands following conditional purpose clauses, 
<br /> such as those beginning with "hina."
