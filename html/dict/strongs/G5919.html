<br /> typos has many meanings, among the most common being image, 
<br /> pattern or model, and type. In the last sense it means a 
<br /> person or thing prefiguring a future person or thing, e.g., Adam as a 
<br /> type of Christ, Ro 5:14. 
<br /> 
<br /> antitypos, as used in 1Pe 3:21, is by Thayer and many others 
<br /> thought to correspond to typos as its counterpart, in the sense which 
<br /> the English word antitype suggests. By Cremer it is rather given the 
<br /> meaning image.
