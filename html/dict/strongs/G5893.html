<br /> 
<br /> asteios is properly one living in a city, urban. It soon acquires 
<br /> the meaning urbane, polite, elegant. Then it obtains to a limited 
<br /> extent the meaning beautiful, although never in the highest degree. 
<br /> 
<br /> oraios, from ora, hour, period, means properly timely. 
<br /> From that comes the idea of being beautiful, since nearly everything 
<br /> is beautiful in its hour of fullest perfection. 
<br /> 
<br /> kalos is a much higher word. It means beautiful, physically or 
<br /> morally.  It is, however, distinctly the beauty which comes from 
<br /> harmony, the beauty which arises from a symmetrical adjustment in 
<br /> right proportion, in other words, from the harmonious completeness of 
<br /> the object concerned.
