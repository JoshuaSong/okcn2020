<br /> Both words in a certain sense mean rest, but from different 
<br /> standpoints. anapausis is rest which comes by cessation from labor, 
<br /> which may be simply temporary. 
<br /> 
<br /> anesis means literally the relaxation of strings which have been 
<br /> drawn tight. Hence, it is used to designate ease, especially that which 
<br /> comes by relaxation of unfavorable conditions of any kind, such as 
<br /> affliction.
