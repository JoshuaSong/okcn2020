<br /> 
<br /> theosebes, according to derivation and usage, means worship of God 
<br /> (or of the gods), a fulfillment of one's duty towards God. It is a 
<br /> general term, meaning religious in a good sense. 
<br /> 
<br /> eusebes is distinguished from theosebes in two ways. It is used 
<br /> to include the fulfillment of obligations of all kinds, both towards 
<br /> God and man. It is thus applied to the fulfillment of the duties 
<br /> involved in human relations, as towards one's parents. Furthermore, 
<br /> when used in the higher sense, it means not any kind of worship, but, 
<br /> as the etymology indicates, the worshipping of God aright. 
<br /> 
<br /> eulabes meaning originally careful in handling, in its 
<br /> religious application means careful in handling divine things. It 
<br /> characterizes the anxious and scrupulous worshipper, careful not to 
<br /> change anything that should be observed in worship, and fearful of 
<br /> offending.  It means devout, and may be applied to an adherent of 
<br /> any religion, being especially appropriate to describe the best of the 
<br /> Jewish worshippers. 
<br /> 
<br /> threkos is one who is diligent in the performance of the outward 
<br /> service of God. It applies especially to ceremonial worship. 
<br /> 
<br /> deisidaimon, in accordance with its derivation, makes prominent 
<br /> the element of fear.  It emphasizes strongly the ideas of dependence 
<br /> and of anxiety for divine favor. It may be used as practically 
<br /> equivalent to theosebes.  Often, however, it implies that the fear 
<br /> which it makes prominent is an unworthy fear, so that it comes to have 
<br /> the meaning superstitious.  In the N.T. it is used, as is also the 
<br /> noun deisidaimonia, in a purposely neutral sense, meaning simply 
<br /> religious_, neither conveying the highest meaning, nor plainly implying 
<br /> a lower meaning.
