<br /> 
<br /> 5603 is the generic term? 5568 and 5215 are specific, the 
<br /> former designating a song which took its general character 
<br /> from the OT Psalms, although not restricted to them, the 
<br /> later a song of praise.  While the leading idea of 5568 is a 
<br /> musical accompaniment, and that of 5215 praise to God, 5603 
<br /> is the general word for a song, whether accompanied or not, 
<br /> whether of praise  or on any other subject. Thus it is quite 
<br /> possible for the same song to be at once described by all 
<br /> three of these words.
