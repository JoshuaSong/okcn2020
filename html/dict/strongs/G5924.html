<br /> According to their derivation, palaios is that which has been in 
<br /> existence for a long time, archaios that which has been from the 
<br /> beginning.  In use, at times no distinction can be drawn. Often, 
<br /> however, archaios does denote distinctively that which has been from 
<br /> the beginning, and so it reaches back to a point of time beyond 
<br /> palaios. palaios has often the secondary meaning of that which 
<br /> is old and so worn out, having suffered more or less from the injuries 
<br /> and ravages of time, its opposite in this sense being kainos.
