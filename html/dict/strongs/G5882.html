<br /> 
<br /> aidos is the feeling of innate moral repugnance to doing a 
<br /> dishonorable act. This moral repugnance is not found in aischyne, 
<br /> which is rather the feeling of disgrache which results from doing 
<br /> an unworthy thing, or the fear of such disgrace which serves to 
<br /> prevent its being done. aidos is thus the nobler word, aischyne 
<br /> having regard chiefly to the opinions of others. aidos is the fear 
<br /> of doing a shameful thing, aischyne is chiefly the fear of being 
<br /> found out. "aidos would always restrain a good man from an 
<br /> unworthy act, while aischyne might sometimes restrain a bad one" 
<br /> (Trench). 
<br /> 
<br /> entrope stands somewhat between the other two words in meaning, 
<br /> but in the N.T. leans to the nobler side, indicating that 
<br /> wholesome shame which leads a man to consideration of his 
<br /> condition if it is unworthy, and to a change of conduct for the 
<br /> better. 
<br /> 
<br /> sophrosyne, self-command, may not seem to have much in common 
<br /> with these three words. As a matter of fact, however, it expresses 
<br /> positively that which aidwv expresses negatively.
