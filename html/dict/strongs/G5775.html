<div><article>Tense-Imperfect 
<br /> 
<br /> The imperfect tense generally represents continual or repeated 
<br /> action.  Where the present tense might indicate "they are 
<br /> asking, " the imperfect would indicate "they kept on asking." 
<br /> 
<br /> In the case of the verb "to be, " however, the imperfect tense 
<br /> is used as a general past tense and does not carry the 
<br /> connotation of continual or repeated action.
