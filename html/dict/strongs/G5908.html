<br /> These words may be used with very little distinction of meaning, but 
<br /> often the difference is marked. kakos frequently means evil 
<br /> rather negatively, referring to the absence of the qualities which 
<br /> constitute a person or thing what it should be or what it claims to 
<br /> be. It is also used meaning evil in a moral sense. It is a general 
<br /> antithesis to agathos. 
<br /> 
<br /> poneros is a word at once stronger and more active, it means 
<br /> mischief-making, delighting in injury, doing evil to others, 
<br /> dangerous, destructive. kakos describes the quality according to 
<br /> its nature, poneros, according to its effects. 
<br /> 
<br /> phaulos is the bad chiefly as the worthless, the good for 
<br /> nothing.
