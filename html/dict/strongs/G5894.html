<br /> 
<br /> sophia is certainly the highest word of all these. It is properly 
<br /> wisdom.  It denotes mental excellence in the highest and fullest 
<br /> sense, expressing an attitude as well as an act of the mind. 
<br /> It comprehends knowledge and implies goodness, including the striving 
<br /> after the highest ends, as well as the using of the best means for 
<br /> their attainment. It is never ascribed to any one but God and good 
<br /> men, except in a plainly ironical sense. 
<br /> 
<br /> phronesis is a middle term, sometimes having a meaning nearly as 
<br /> high as sophia, sometimes much lower. It means prudence,  
<br /> intelligence, a skillful adaptation of the means to the end 
<br /> desired, the end, however, not being necessarily a good one. 
<br /> 
<br /> gnosis is knowledge, cognition, the understanding of facts or 
<br /> truths, or else insight, discernment. 
<br /> 
<br /> epignosis has an intensive meaning as compared with gnosis, it 
<br /> is a fuller, clearer, more thorough knowledge. The verb epiginosko 
<br /> has the same intensive force as compared with ginosko.
