<br /> nous is distinctly the reflective consciousness, ``the organ of 
<br /> moral thinking and knowing, the intellectual organ of moral sentiment'' 
<br /> (Cremer). 
<br /> 
<br /> dianoia meant originally activity of thinking, but has borrowed 
<br /> from nous its common meaning of faculty of thought. It is more 
<br /> common than nous, and has largely replaced it in its usual meanings.
