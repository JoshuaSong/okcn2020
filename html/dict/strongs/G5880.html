<br /> 
<br /> aplous is literally spread out without folds, and hence means 
<br /> single, simple, without complexity of character and motive. In the 
<br /> N.T. this idea of simplicity is always favorable? in classical Greek 
<br /> the word is also occasionally used in an unfavorable sense, denoting 
<br /> foolish simplicity. 
<br /> 
<br /> akeraios also means simple, literally free from any 
<br /> foreign admixture, unadulterated, free fram disturbing elements. 
<br /> 
<br /> akakos in Heb 7:26 means one in whom exists absence of all 
<br /> evil, and so by implication the presence of all good. It passes also 
<br /> through the merely negative meaning of absence of evil, found in the 
<br /> Septuagint, to the unfavorable meaning of simple, easily deceived, 
<br /> credulous, which is found in Ro 16:18. 
<br /> 
<br /> adolos, occurring only in 1Pe 2:2, means sincere,  
<br /> unmixed, without guile.
