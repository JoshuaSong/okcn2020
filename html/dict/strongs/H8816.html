<div><article>Perfect 
<br /> 
<br /> The Perfect expresses a completed action. 
<br /> 
<br /> 1) In reference to time,  such an action may be: 
<br /> 
<br /> 1a) one just completed from the standpoint of the present 
<br /> "I have come" to tell you the news 
<br /> 
<br /> 1b) one completed in the more or less distant past 
<br /> in the beginning God "created" 
<br /> "I was (once) young" and "I have (now) grown old" but 
<br /> "I have not seen" a righteous man forsaken 
<br /> 
<br /> 1c) one already completed from the point of view of another 
<br /> past act 
<br /> God saw everything that "he had made" 
<br /> 
<br /> 1d) one completed from the point of view of another action 
<br /> yet future 
<br /> I will draw for thy camels also until "they have done" 
<br /> drinking 
<br /> 
<br /> 2) The perfect is often used where the present is employed in 
<br /> English. 
<br /> 
<br /> 2a) in the case of general truths or actions of frequent 
<br /> occurrence--truths or actions which have been often 
<br /> experienced or observed 
<br /> the grass "withereth" 
<br /> the sparrow "findeth" a house 
<br /> 
<br /> 2b) an action or attitude of the past may be continued into 
<br /> the present 
<br /> "I stretch out" my hands to thee 
<br /> "thou never forsakest" those who seek thee 
<br /> 
<br /> 2c) the perfect of intransitive verbs is used where English 
<br /> uses the present; The perfect in Hebrew in such a case 
<br /> emphasises a condition which has come into "complete 
<br /> existence" and realisation 
<br /> "I know" thou wilt be king 
<br /> "I hate" all workers of iniquity 
<br /> 
<br /> 2d) Sometimes in Hebrew,  future events are conceived so 
<br /> vividly and so realistically that they are regarded as 
<br /> Having virtually taken place and are described by the 
<br /> perfect. 
<br /> 
<br /> 2d1) in promises,  threats and language of contracts 
<br /> the field "give I" thee 
<br /> and if not,  "I will take it" 
<br /> 
<br /> 2d2) prophetic language 
<br /> my people "is gone into captivity" 
<br /> (i.e. shall assuredly go).
