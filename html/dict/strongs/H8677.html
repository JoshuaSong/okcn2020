<div><article>Synonym Strong's Numbers 
<br /> 
<br /> Sometimes,  a word or phrase has individual Strong's numbers assigned to it and it has an additional Strong's number for the entire phrase. In Jud 20:18 the phrase "house of God" is coded as "house  { [<a class="strongs" href="/strongs/H1004">H1004</a>]} { [<a class="strongs" href="/strongs/H1004">H1004</a>]} of God  { [<a class="strongs" href="/strongs/H430">H430</a>]} { [<a class="strongs" href="/strongs/H430">H430</a>]}   { [<a class="strongs" href="/strongs/H1008">H1008</a>]} { [<a class="strongs" href="/strongs/H1008">H1008</a>]}" In this case the phrase could also mean place Bethel which has the Strong's number  { [<a class="strongs" href="/strongs/H1008">H1008</a>]}.  Only by context can you distinguish proper names in Hebrew from individual words. Hence translators do arrive at different renderings for the same Hebrew.
