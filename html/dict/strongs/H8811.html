<div><article>Imperfect 
<br /> 
<br /> The imperfect expresses an action,  process or condition which is 
<br /> incomplete,  and it has a wide range of meaning: 
<br /> 
<br /> 1a) It is used to describe a single (as opposed to a repeated) action 
<br /> in the past; it differs from the perfect in being more vivid and 
<br /> pictorial. The perfect expresses the "fact",  the imperfect adds 
<br /> colour and movement by suggesting the "process" preliminary to its 
<br /> completion. 
<br /> He put forth his hand to the door 
<br /> it came to a halt 
<br /> I began to hear 
<br /> 
<br /> 1b) A phrase such as "What seekest thou?",  refers not only to the 
<br /> present,  but assumes that the search has continued for some time. 
<br /> 
<br /> Why do you weep? 
<br /> Why refuse to eat? 
<br /> Why are you distressed? 
<br /> 
<br /> These relate not so much as to one occasion,  as to a 
<br /> continued condition. 
<br /> 
<br /> 2) The kind of progression or imperfection and unfinished condition 
<br /> of the action may consist in its frequent repetition. 
<br /> 
<br /> 2a) In the present: 
<br /> 
<br /> it is "said" today 
<br /> a wise son "maketh glad" his father 
<br /> 
<br /> 2b) In the past: 
<br /> 
<br /> "and so he did"       -  regularly,  year by year 
<br /> a mist "used to go up" 
<br /> the fish which "we used to eat" 
<br /> the manna "came down" -regularly 
<br /> He "spoke"            -repeatedly 
<br /> 
<br /> 3) The imperfect is used to express the "future",  referring not only 
<br /> to an action which is about to be accomplished but one which has 
<br /> not yet begun: 
<br /> 
<br /> 3a) This may be a future from the point of view of the real 
<br /> present; as: 
<br /> 
<br /> Now "shalt thou <span style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	</span> <span style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	</span> See what I will do" 
<br /> "We will burn" thy house 
<br /> 
<br /> 3b) It may be a future from any other point of view assumed; as: 
<br /> He took his son that "was to reign" 
<br /> she stayed to <span style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	</span> <span style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	</span> See what "should be done" 
<br /> 
<br /> 4) The usage of 3b may be taken as the transitive to a common use of 
<br /> the imperfect in which it serves for an expression of those shades 
<br /> of relation among acts and thoughts for which English prefers the 
<br /> conditional moods. Such actions are strictly "future" in reference 
<br /> to the assumed point of relation,  and the simple imperfect 
<br /> sufficiently expresses them; e.g. 
<br /> 
<br /> of every tree thou "mayest eat" 
<br /> "could we know" 
<br /> He "would" say 
<br /> 
<br /> 5a) The imperfect follows particles expressing "transition", 
<br /> "purpose",  "result" and so forth as,  "in order that",  "lest"; e.g. 
<br /> 
<br /> say thou art my sister,  "that it may be well with thee" 
<br /> let us deal wisely with the nation,  "lest it multiplies" 
<br /> 
<br /> 5b) When however there is a strong feeling of "purpose",  or when it 
<br /> is meant to be strongly marked,  then of course the moods are 
<br /> employed; e.g. 
<br /> 
<br /> raise me up "that I may requite them" 
<br /> who will entice Ahab "that he may go up" 
<br /> what shall we do "that the sea may be calm" 
<br /> 
<br /> The moods are also employed to express that class of 
<br /> future actions which we express in the "optative" 
<br /> 
<br /> "may I die" 
<br /> "may" the LORD "establish" his word 
<br /> "may" the child "live".
