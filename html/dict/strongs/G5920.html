<br /> Thayer, as opposed to Trench and others, would make the distinction 
<br /> between these two words to be this: ``aiteo signifies to ask for 
<br /> something to be given, not done, giving prominence to the thing asked 
<br /> for rather than the person, and hence is rarely used in exhortation. 
<br /> erotao, on the other hand, is to request a person to do (rarely to 
<br /> give) something? referring more directly to the person, it is naturally 
<br /> used in exhortation, etc.''
