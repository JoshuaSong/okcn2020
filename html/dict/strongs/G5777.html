<div><article>Tense-Aorist 
<br /> 
<br /> The aorist tense is characterized by its emphasis on punctiliar 
<br /> action; that is, the concept of the verb is considered without 
<br /> regard for past, present, or future time.  There is no 
<br /> direct or clear English equivalent for this tense, though it is 
<br /> generally rendered as a simple past tense in most translations. 
<br /> 
<br /> The events described by the aorist tense are classified into a 
<br /> number of categories by grammarians.  The most common of these 
<br /> include a view of the action as having begun from a certain 
<br /> point ("inceptive aorist"), or having ended at a certain point 
<br /> ("cumulative aorist"), or merely existing at a certain point 
<br /> ("punctiliar aorist").  The categorization of other cases can 
<br /> be found in Greek reference grammars. 
<br /> 
<br /> The English reader need not concern himself with most of these 
<br /> finer points concerning the aorist tense, since in most cases 
<br /> they cannot be rendered accurately in English translation, 
<br /> being fine points of Greek exegesis only.  The common practice 
<br /> of rendering an aorist by a simple English past tense should 
<br /> suffice in most cases.
