<br /> 
<br /> palingenesia means new birth. In classical Greek it was used 
<br /> in a weakened sense to denote a recovery, restoration, revival. In the 
<br /> N.T. it is used only twice, but in a higher sense. In Tit 3:5 it 
<br /> means new birth, regeneration, referring to God's act of causing 
<br /> the sinner to pass from the death of sin into spiritual life in 
<br /> Christ. It has a wider meaning in Mt 19:28, where it is used of 
<br /> the change which is ultimately to take place in all the universe, its 
<br /> regeneration, which is the full working out of the change involved in 
<br /> the regeneration of the individual. 
<br /> 
<br /> anakainoosis is renewal or renovation, denoting a 
<br /> continuous process through which man becomes more fully Christ-like, 
<br /> in which process he is a worker together with God. Some, as e.g. 
<br /> Cremer, without sufficient reason, have thought that the early use of 
<br /> palingenesia as a somewhat technical term, to denote the 
<br /> Pythagorean doctrine of transmigration, gave to the word a permanent 
<br /> eschatological coloring, so that in the N.T. it has the meaning 
<br /> resurrection, especially in Mt 19:28.
