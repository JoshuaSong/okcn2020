<br /> 
<br /> doulos is the usual word for slave, one who is permanently in 
<br /> servitude, in subjection to a master. 
<br /> 
<br /> therapon is simply one who renders service at a particular time, 
<br /> sometimes as a slave, more often as a freeman, who renders voluntary 
<br /> service prompted by duty or love.  It denotes one who serves, in 
<br /> his relation to a person. 
<br /> 
<br /> diakonos also may designate either a slave or a freeman, it denotes 
<br /> a servant viewed in relation to his work. 
<br /> 
<br /> oiketes designates a slave, sometimes being practically equivalent 
<br /> to doulos.  Usually, however, as the etymology of the term 
<br /> indicates, it means a slave as a member of the household, not 
<br /> emphasizing the servile idea, but rather the relation which would tend 
<br /> to mitigate the severity of his condition. 
<br /> 
<br /> yperetes means literally an under-rower, and was used to describe 
<br /> an ordinary rower on a war-galley. It is then used, as in the N.T., to 
<br /> indicate any man, not a slave, who served in a subordinate position 
<br /> under a superior.
