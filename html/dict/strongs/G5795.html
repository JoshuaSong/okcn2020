<div><article>Mood-Infinitive 
<br /> 
<br /> The Greek infinitive mood in most cases corresponds to the 
<br /> English infinitive, which is basically the verb with "to" 
<br /> prefixed, as "to believe." 
<br /> 
<br /> Like the English infinitive, the Greek infinitive can be used 
<br /> like a noun phrase ("It is better to live than to die"), as 
<br /> well as to reflect purpose or result ("This was done to 
<br /> fulfil what the prophet said").
