<br /> to the English verbal noun ending in "- ing" 
<br /> 
<br /> 1a1) as subject 
<br /> to keep the judgments 
<br /> to seek thy heart 
<br /> 
<br /> 1a2) as object 
<br /> in his "writing" 
<br /> He spoke,  "saying" 
<br /> 
<br /> 1b) The Infinitive Absolute does not allow prefixes or suffixes 
<br />
