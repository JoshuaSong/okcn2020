<br /> 
<br /> zoon is a general term, meaning living creature, which may 
<br /> include all living beings, in classical Greek even including man. In 
<br /> the N.T. it means ordinarily animal. 
<br /> 
<br /> therion is beast, usually wild beast. It implies perhaps not 
<br /> necessarily wildness and ferocity, but at least a certain amount of 
<br /> brutality which is wanting in zoon. zoon emphasizes the 
<br /> qualities in which animals are akin to man, therion, those in which 
<br /> they are inferior.
