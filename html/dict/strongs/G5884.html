<br /> 
<br /> epitimao means simply to rebuke, in any sense. It may be 
<br /> justly or unjustly, and, if justly, the rebuke may be heeded or it may 
<br /> not. 
<br /> 
<br /> elencho, on the other hand, means to rebuke with sufficient cause, 
<br /> and also effectually, so as to bring the one rebuked to a confession 
<br /> or at least a conviction of sin.  In other words, it means to 
<br /> convince. 
<br /> 
<br /> A similar distinction exists between the nouns aitia and 
<br /> elenchos.  aitia is an accusation, whether false or true. 
<br /> elenchos is a charge which is shown to be true, and often is so 
<br /> confessed by the accused.  It has both a judicial and a moral meaning.
