<br /> 
<br /> In many cases these two words are used without appreciable distinction, 
<br /> meaning conscious willing, purpose. But frequently it is evident 
<br /> that a difference is intended, although there is much difference of 
<br /> opinion as to the exact distinction. Thayer says that boulomai 
<br /> ``seems to designate the will which follows deliberation, ''thelo, 
<br /> ``the will which proceeds from inclination.''Grimm, on the other hand, 
<br /> says that thelo gives prominence to the emotive element, 
<br /> boulomai to the rational and volitive? thelo signifies the 
<br /> choice, while boulomai marks the choice as deliberate and 
<br /> intelligent. The view of Cremer on the whole seems preferable to any 
<br /> other. According to this view, boulomai has the wider range of 
<br /> meaning, but thelo is the stronger word? thelo denotes the active 
<br /> resolution, the will urging on to action, see Ro 7:15, while 
<br /> boulomai is rather to have in thought, to intend, to be determined. 
<br /> boulomai sometimes means no more than to have an inclination, see 
<br /> Ac 23:15. Instructive examples of the use of the two words in 
<br /> close proximity are found in Mr 15:9,15, and especially 
<br /> Mt 1:19.
