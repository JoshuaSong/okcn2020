<div><article>Mood-Optative 
<br /> 
<br /> The optative mood is generally used in the so-called 
<br /> "fourth-class" conditions which express a wish or desire for 
<br /> an action to occur in which the completion of such is 
<br /> doubtful.  By the time of the New Testament, the optative mood 
<br /> was beginning to disappear from spoken and written Greek, and 
<br /> such rarely occurs in the New Testament. 
<br /> 
<br /> In a few cases, verbs in the optative mood stand apart from a 
<br /> conditional clause to express the strongest possible wish 
<br /> regarding an event.  The most common of these appears in the 
<br /> phrase "mh genoito" (AV, "God forbid"; NKJV "Certainly not").
