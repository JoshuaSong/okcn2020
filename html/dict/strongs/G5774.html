<div><article>Tense-Present 
<br /> 
<br /> The present tense represents a simple statement of fact 
<br /> or reality viewed as occurring in actual time.  In most cases 
<br /> this corresponds directly with the English present tense. 
<br /> 
<br /> Some phrases which might be rendered as past tense in English 
<br /> will often occur in the present tense in Greek.  These are 
<br /> termed "historical presents, " and such occurrences dramatize 
<br /> the event described as if the reader were there watching the 
<br /> event occur.  Some English translations render such historical 
<br /> presents in the English past tense, while others permit the 
<br /> tense to remain in the present.
