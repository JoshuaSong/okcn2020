<br /> <span style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	</span><b>1.</b>  flood, deluge.    <br /> <span style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	</span> <span style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	</span><b>a.</b>  Noah's flood that submerged the entire planet earth under  water for about a year ++++  Some think Noah's flood was only local. However the description of it found in Gen. 6 through 8 makes this patently absurd. If it was local, Noah had 120 years to migrate out of the area to safe ground! Why waste all that effort building a ship?  With the possible exception of Ps. 29:10, this word always refers to Noah's flood.<br />
