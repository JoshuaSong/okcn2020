<br /> 
<br /> timoria in classical and N.T. usage denotes especially the 
<br /> vindicative character of punishment, it is the punishment in relation 
<br /> to the punisher. 
<br /> 
<br /> kolasis in classical Greek meant usually punishment which aimed at 
<br /> the reformation of the offender. But sometimes in later Greek, and 
<br /> always in the N.T., the idea of reformation seems to disappear, so 
<br /> that there remains simply the idea of punishment, but viewed in 
<br /> relation to the punished.
