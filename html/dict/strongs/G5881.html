<br /> 
<br /> morologia, used only once in the N.T., is foolish talking, but 
<br /> this in the Biblical sense of the word foolish, which implies that it 
<br /> is also sinful.  It is conversation which is first insipid, then 
<br /> corrupt. It is random talk, which naturally reveals the vanity and sin 
<br /> of the heart. 
<br /> 
<br /> aischrologia, also used once, means any kind of disgraceful 
<br /> language, especially abuse of others. In classical Greek it sometimes 
<br /> means distinctively language which leads to lewdness. 
<br /> 
<br /> eutrapelia, occurring once, originally meant versatility in 
<br /> conversation.  It acquires, however, an unfavorable meaning, since 
<br /> polished, refined conversation has a tendency to become evil in many 
<br /> ways.  The word denotes, then, a subtle form of evil-speaking, sinful 
<br /> conversation without the coarseness which frequently accompanies it, 
<br /> but not without its malignity.
