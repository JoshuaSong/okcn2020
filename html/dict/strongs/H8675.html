<div><article>Kethiv Readings 
<br /> 
<br /> In the Hebrew Bible,  the scribes did not alter any text they felt had been copied incorrectly. Rather they noted in the margin what they thought the written text should be. The written variation is called a kethiv and the marginal note is called the qere. Where the translators of the Authorised Version followed the qere reading rather than the kethiv,  we indicate the kethiv reading by the number 08675. For example,  in Ge 24:33 "was set" is coded as  { [<a class="strongs" href="/strongs/H7760">H7760</a>]} 08675  { [<a class="strongs" href="/strongs/H3455">H3455</a>]}. The translators used the qere reading that has Strong's number  { [<a class="strongs" href="/strongs/H7760">H7760</a>]} but the kethiv reading is Strong's number  { [<a class="strongs" href="/strongs/H3455">H3455</a>]}. Both words have the same meaning,  "was set".
