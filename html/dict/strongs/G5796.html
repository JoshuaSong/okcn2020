<br /> 
<br /> The Greek participle corresponds for the most part to the 
<br /> English participle, reflecting "- ing" or "- ed" being suffixed 
<br /> to the basic verb form.  The participle can be used either 
<br /> like a verb or a noun, as in English, and thus is often termed 
<br /> a "verbal noun."
