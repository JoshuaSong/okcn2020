<br /> mochthos is labor, hard and often painful. It is the ordinary 
<br /> word for common labor which is the usual lot of humanity. 
<br /> 
<br /> ponos is labor which demands one's whole strength. It is 
<br /> therefore applied to labors of an unusual kind, specially wearing or 
<br /> painful. In classical Greek it was the usual word employed to describe 
<br /> the labors of Hercules. 
<br /> 
<br /> kopos denotes the weariness which results from labor, or labor 
<br /> considered from the stand-point of the resulting weariness.
