<br /> These words are often used interchangeably, but in many cases a 
<br /> distinction can be drawn. poieo refers more to the object and end 
<br /> of an act, prasso rather to the means by which the object is 
<br /> attained.  Hence, while poieo means to accomplish, prasso 
<br /> may mean nothing more than merely to busy one's self about. 
<br /> poieo often means to do a thing once for all, prasso to do 
<br /> continually or repeatedly.  From these distinctions it follows that 
<br /> poieo, being on the whole the higher word, is more often used of 
<br /> doing good, prasso more frequently of doing evil.
