<br /> 
<br /> miaino meant originally to stain, as with color. 
<br /> 
<br /> molyno meant originally to smear over, as with mud or filth, 
<br /> always having a bad meaning, while the meaning of miaino might be 
<br /> either good or bad.  According to classical Greek, miaino has a 
<br /> religious meaning, to profane, while molyno is simply to 
<br /> spoil, disgrace. As ethically applied in the N.T. they have both 
<br /> practically the same meaning, to pollute, defile. It is, however, 
<br /> true that miaino, to judge from classical usage, refers chiefly to 
<br /> the effect of the act not on the individual, but on others, on the 
<br /> community.
