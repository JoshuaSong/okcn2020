to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would enquire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him.</span></span></div><div class="p"><span class="verse v16" data-usfm="ACT.23.16"><span class="label">16</span><span class="content">And when Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait, he
