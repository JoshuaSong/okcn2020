for we are left but a few of many, as thine eyes do behold us: </span></span><span class="verse v3" data-usfm="JER.42.3"><span class="label">3</span><span class="content">that Jehovah thy God may show us the way wherein we should walk, and the thing that we should do. </span></span><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="JER.42.4"><span class="label">4</span><span class="content">Then Jeremiah the prophet said unto them, I have heard you;

</span></span><span class="verse v16" data-usfm="JER.42.16"><span class="label">16</span><span class="content">then it shall come to pass, that the sword, which ye fear, shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt; and the famine, whereof ye are afraid, shall follow hard after you there in Egypt; and there ye shall die. </span></span><span class="verse v17" data-usfm="JER.42.17"><span class="label">17</span><span class="content">So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there: they shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them. </span></span><span class="verse v18" data-usfm="JER.42.18"><span class="label">18</span><span class="content">For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: As mine anger and my wrath hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so shall my wrath be poured forth upon you, when ye shall enter into Egypt;

for ye sent me unto Jehovah your God, saying, Pray for us unto Jehovah our God; and according unto all that Jehovah our God shall say, so declare unto us, and we will do it: </span></span><span class="verse v21" data-usfm="JER.42.21"><span class="label">21</span><span class="content">and I have this day declared it to you; but ye have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah your God in anything for which he hath sent me unto you. </span></span><span class="verse v22" data-usfm="JER.42.22"><span class="label">22</span><span class="content">Now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, in the place whither ye desire to go to sojourn there. </span></span></div>
