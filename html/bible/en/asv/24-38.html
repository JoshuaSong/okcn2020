And in the dungeon there was no water, but mire; and Jeremiah sank in the mire. </span></span><span class="verse v7" data-usfm="JER.38.7"><span class="label">7</span><span class="content">Now when Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, a eunuch, who was in the king&#8217;s house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon (the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin,) </span></span><span class="verse v8" data-usfm="JER.38.8"><span class="label">8</span><span class="content">Ebed-melech went forth out of the king&#8217;s house, and spake to the king, saying, </span></span><span class="verse v9" data-usfm="JER.38.9"><span class="label">9</span><span class="content">My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is like to die in the place where he is, because of the famine; for there is no more bread in the city. </span></span><span class="verse v10" data-usfm="JER.38.10"><span class="label">10</span><span class="content">Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he die. </span></span><span class="verse v11" data-usfm="JER.38.11"><span class="label">11</span><span class="content">So Ebed-melech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took thence rags and worn-out garments, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah. </span></span><span class="verse v12" data-usfm="JER.38.12"><span class="label">12</span><span class="content">And Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now these rags and worn-out garments under thine armholes under the cords. And Jeremiah did so. </span></span><span class="verse v13" data-usfm="JER.38.13"><span class="label">13</span><span class="content">So they drew up Jeremiah with the cords, and took him up out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard. </span></span><span class="verse v14" data-usfm="JER.38.14"><span class="label">14</span><span class="content">Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that is in the house of Jehovah: and the king said unto Jeremiah, I will ask thee a thing; hide nothing from me. </span></span><span class="verse v15" data-usfm="JER.38.15"><span class="label">15</span><span class="content">Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare it unto thee, wilt thou not surely put me to death? and if I give thee counsel, thou wilt not hearken unto me. </span></span><span class="verse v16" data-usfm="JER.38.16"><span class="label">16</span><span class="content">So Zedekiah the king sware secretly unto Jeremiah, saying, As Jehovah liveth, that made us this soul, I will not put thee to death, neither will I give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life. </span></span><span class="verse v17" data-usfm="JER.38.17"><span class="label">17</span><span class="content">Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: If thou wilt go forth unto the king of Babylon&#8217;s princes, then thy soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; and thou shalt live, and thy house. </span></span><span class="verse v18" data-usfm="JER.38.18"><span class="label">18</span><span class="content">But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon&#8217;s princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand. </span></span><span class="verse v19" data-usfm="JER.38.19"><span class="label">19</span><span class="content">And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that are fallen away to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me. </span></span><span class="verse v20" data-usfm="JER.38.20"><span class="label">20</span><span class="content">But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver thee. Obey, I beseech thee, the voice of Jehovah, in that which I speak unto thee: so it shall be well with thee, and thy soul shall live. </span></span><span class="verse v21" data-usfm="JER.38.21"><span class="label">21</span><span class="content">But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the word that Jehovah hath showed me: </span></span><span class="verse v22" data-usfm="JER.38.22"><span class="label">22</span><span class="content">behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judah&#8217;s house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon&#8217;s princes, and those women shall say, Thy familiar friends have set thee on, and have prevailed over thee: now that thy feet are sunk in the mire, they are turned away back. </span></span><span class="verse v23" data-usfm="JER.38.23"><span class="label">23</span><span class="content">And they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans; and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire. </span></span><span class="verse v24" data-usfm="JER.38.24"><span class="label">24</span><span class="content">Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and thou shalt not die. </span></span><span class="verse v25" data-usfm="JER.38.25"><span class="label">25</span><span class="content">But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they come unto thee, and say unto thee, Declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king; hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to death; also what the king said unto thee: </span></span><span class="verse v26" data-usfm="JER.38.26"><span class="label">26</span><span class="content">then thou shalt say unto them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan&#8217;s house, to die there. </span></span><span class="verse v27" data-usfm="JER.38.27"><span class="label">27</span><span class="content">Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him; and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived. </span></span><span class="verse v28" data-usfm="JER.38.28"><span class="label">28</span><span class="content">So Jeremiah abode in the court of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was taken. </span></span></div>
