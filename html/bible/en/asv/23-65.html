for they are the seed of the blessed of Jehovah, and their offspring with them. </span></span><span class="verse v24" data-usfm="ISA.65.24"><span class="label">24</span><span class="content">And it shall come to pass that, before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear. </span></span><span class="verse v25" data-usfm="ISA.65.25"><span class="label">25</span><span class="content">The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the ox; and dust shall be the serpent&#8217;s food. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith Jehovah. </span></span></div>
