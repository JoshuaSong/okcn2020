and madest thee a name, as at this day; </span></span><span class="verse v21" data-usfm="JER.32.21"><span class="label">21</span><span class="content">and didst bring forth thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great terror;

for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, saith Jehovah. </span></span><span class="verse v31" data-usfm="JER.32.31"><span class="label">31</span><span class="content">For this city hath been to me a provocation of mine anger and of my wrath from the day that they built it even unto this day; that I should remove it from before my face, </span></span><span class="verse v32" data-usfm="JER.32.32"><span class="label">32</span><span class="content">because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. </span></span><span class="verse v33" data-usfm="JER.32.33"><span class="label">33</span><span class="content">And they have turned unto me the back, and not the face: and though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not hearkened to receive instruction. </span></span><span class="verse v34" data-usfm="JER.32.34"><span class="label">34</span><span class="content">But they set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to defile it. </span></span><span class="verse v35" data-usfm="JER.32.35"><span class="label">35</span><span class="content">And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire unto Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin. </span></span><span class="verse v36" data-usfm="JER.32.36"><span class="label">36</span><span class="content">And now therefore thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, concerning this city, whereof ye say, It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence: </span></span><span class="verse v37" data-usfm="JER.32.37"><span class="label">37</span><span class="content">Behold, I will gather them out of all the countries, whither I have driven them in mine anger, and in my wrath, and in great indignation;
