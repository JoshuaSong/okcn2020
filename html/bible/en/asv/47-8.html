</span></span><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="2CO.8.2"><span class="label">2</span><span class="content">how that in much proof of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality. </span></span><span class="verse v3" data-usfm="2CO.8.3"><span class="label">3</span><span class="content">For according to their power, I bear witness, yea and beyond their power, they gave of their own accord, </span></span><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="2CO.8.4"><span class="label">4</span><span class="content">beseeching us with much entreaty in regard of this grace and the fellowship in the ministering to the saints: </span></span><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="2CO.8.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content">and this, not as we had hoped, but first they gave their own selves to the Lord, and to us through the will of God. </span></span><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="2CO.8.6"><span class="label">6</span><span class="content">Insomuch that we exhorted Titus, that as he made a beginning before, so he would also complete in you this grace also. </span></span><span class="verse v7" data-usfm="2CO.8.7"><span class="label">7</span><span class="content">But as ye abound in everything, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all earnestness, and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also. </span></span><span class="verse v8" data-usfm="2CO.8.8"><span class="label">8</span><span class="content">I speak not by way of commandment, but as proving through the earnestness of others the sincerity also of your love. </span></span><span class="verse v9" data-usfm="2CO.8.9"><span class="label">9</span><span class="content">For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might become rich. </span></span><span class="verse v10" data-usfm="2CO.8.10"><span class="label">10</span><span class="content">And herein I give my judgment: for this is expedient for you, who were the first to make a beginning a year ago, not only to do, but also to will. </span></span><span class="verse v11" data-usfm="2CO.8.11"><span class="label">11</span><span class="content">But now complete the doing also; that as there was the readiness to will, so there may be the completion also out of your ability. </span></span><span class="verse v12" data-usfm="2CO.8.12"><span class="label">12</span><span class="content">For if the readiness is there, it is acceptable according as a man hath, not according as he hath not. </span></span><span class="verse v13" data-usfm="2CO.8.13"><span class="label">13</span><span class="content">For I say not this that others may be eased and ye distressed;
