now it was so, that when I saw, I was in Shushan the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in the vision, and I was by the river Ulai. </span></span><span class="verse v3" data-usfm="DAN.8.3"><span class="label">3</span><span class="content">Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last. </span></span><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="DAN.8.4"><span class="label">4</span><span class="content">I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; and no beasts could stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and magnified himself. </span></span><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="DAN.8.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content">And as I was considering, behold, a he-goat came from the west over the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes. </span></span><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="DAN.8.6"><span class="label">6</span><span class="content">And he came to the ram that had the two horns, which I saw standing before the river, and ran upon him in the fury of his power. </span></span><span class="verse v7" data-usfm="DAN.8.7"><span class="label">7</span><span class="content">And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with anger against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns; and there was no power in the ram to stand before him; but he cast him down to the ground, and trampled upon him; and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand. </span></span><span class="verse v8" data-usfm="DAN.8.8"><span class="label">8</span><span class="content">And the he-goat magnified himself exceedingly: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and instead of it there came up four notable horns toward the four winds of heaven. </span></span><span class="verse v9" data-usfm="DAN.8.9"><span class="label">9</span><span class="content">And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the glorious land. </span></span><span class="verse v10" data-usfm="DAN.8.10"><span class="label">10</span><span class="content">And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and some of the host and of the stars it cast down to the ground, and trampled upon them. </span></span><span class="verse v11" data-usfm="DAN.8.11"><span class="label">11</span><span class="content">Yea, it magnified itself, even to the prince of the host; and it took away from him the continual burnt-offering, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down. </span></span><span class="verse v12" data-usfm="DAN.8.12"><span class="label">12</span><span class="content">And the host was given over to it together with the continual burnt-offering through transgression; and it cast down truth to the ground, and it did its pleasure and prospered. </span></span><span class="verse v13" data-usfm="DAN.8.13"><span class="label">13</span><span class="content">Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy one said unto that certain one who spake, How long shall be the vision </span></span><span class="verse v14" data-usfm="DAN.8.14"><span class="label">14</span><span class="content">And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred evenings and mornings; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed. </span></span><span class="verse v15" data-usfm="DAN.8.15"><span class="label">15</span><span class="content">And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, that I sought to understand it; and, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man. </span></span><span class="verse v16" data-usfm="DAN.8.16"><span class="label">16</span><span class="content">And I heard a man&#8217;s voice between the banks of the Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision. </span></span><span class="verse v17" data-usfm="DAN.8.17"><span class="label">17</span><span class="content">So he came near where I stood; and when he came, I was affrighted, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man; for the vision belongeth to the time of the end. </span></span><span class="verse v18" data-usfm="DAN.8.18"><span class="label">18</span><span class="content">Now as he was speaking with me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face toward the ground; but he touched me, and set me upright. </span></span><span class="verse v19" data-usfm="DAN.8.19"><span class="label">19</span><span class="content">And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the latter time of the indignation; for it belongeth to the appointed time of the end. </span></span><span class="verse v20" data-usfm="DAN.8.20"><span class="label">20</span><span class="content">The ram which thou sawest, that had the two horns, they are the kings of Media and Persia. </span></span><span class="verse v21" data-usfm="DAN.8.21"><span class="label">21</span><span class="content">And the rough he-goat is the king of Greece: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king. </span></span><span class="verse v22" data-usfm="DAN.8.22"><span class="label">22</span><span class="content">And as for that which was broken, in the place whereof four stood up, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not with his power. </span></span><span class="verse v23" data-usfm="DAN.8.23"><span class="label">23</span><span class="content">And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up. </span></span><span class="verse v24" data-usfm="DAN.8.24"><span class="label">24</span><span class="content">And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power; and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper and do his pleasure; and he shall destroy the mighty ones and the holy people. </span></span><span class="verse v25" data-usfm="DAN.8.25"><span class="label">25</span><span class="content">And through his policy he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and in their security shall he destroy many: he shall also stand up against the prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand. </span></span><span class="verse v26" data-usfm="DAN.8.26"><span class="label">26</span><span class="content">And the vision of the evenings and mornings which hath been told is true: but shut thou up the vision; for it belongeth to many days to come. </span></span><span class="verse v27" data-usfm="DAN.8.27"><span class="label">27</span><span class="content">And I, Daniel, fainted, and was sick certain days; then I rose up, and did the king&#8217;s business: and I wondered at the vision, but none understood it. </span></span></div>
