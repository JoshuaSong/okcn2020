so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt any more. </span></span><span class="verse v28" data-usfm="EZK.23.28"><span class="label">28</span><span class="content">For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will deliver thee into the hand of them whom thou hatest, into the hand of them from whom thy soul is alienated; </span></span><span class="verse v29" data-usfm="EZK.23.29"><span class="label">29</span><span class="content">and they shall deal with thee in hatred, and shall take away all thy labor, and shall leave thee naked and bare; and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be uncovered, both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms. </span></span><span class="verse v30" data-usfm="EZK.23.30"><span class="label">30</span><span class="content">These things shall be done unto thee, for that thou hast played the harlot after the nations, and because thou art polluted with their idols. </span></span><span class="verse v31" data-usfm="EZK.23.31"><span class="label">31</span><span class="content">Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I give her cup into thy hand. </span></span><span class="verse v32" data-usfm="EZK.23.32"><span class="label">32</span><span class="content">Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Thou shalt drink of thy sister&#8217;s cup, which is deep and large; thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision; it containeth much. </span></span><span class="verse v33" data-usfm="EZK.23.33"><span class="label">33</span><span class="content">Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria. </span></span><span class="verse v34" data-usfm="EZK.23.34"><span class="label">34</span><span class="content">Thou shalt even drink it and drain it out, and thou shalt gnaw the sherds thereof, and shalt tear thy breasts; for I have spoken it, saith the Lord Jehovah. </span></span><span class="verse v35" data-usfm="EZK.23.35"><span class="label">35</span><span class="content">Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because thou hast forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy whoredoms. </span></span><span class="verse v36" data-usfm="EZK.23.36"><span class="label">36</span><span class="content">Jehovah said moreover unto me: Son of man, wilt thou judge Oholah and Oholibah? then declare unto them their abominations. </span></span><span class="verse v37" data-usfm="EZK.23.37"><span class="label">37</span><span class="content">For they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands; and with their idols have they committed adultery; and they have also caused their sons, whom they bare unto me, to pass through the fire unto them to be devoured. </span></span><span class="verse v38" data-usfm="EZK.23.38"><span class="label">38</span><span class="content">Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths. </span></span><span class="verse v39" data-usfm="EZK.23.39"><span class="label">39</span><span class="content">For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it;

for whom thou didst wash thyself, paint thine eyes, and deck thyself with ornaments, </span></span><span class="verse v41" data-usfm="EZK.23.41"><span class="label">41</span><span class="content">and sit upon a stately bed, with a table prepared before it, whereupon thou didst set mine incense and mine oil. </span></span><span class="verse v42" data-usfm="EZK.23.42"><span class="label">42</span><span class="content">And the voice of a multitude being at ease was with her: and with men of the common sort were brought drunkards from the wilderness; and they put bracelets upon the hands of them twain, and beautiful crowns upon their heads. </span></span><span class="verse v43" data-usfm="EZK.23.43"><span class="label">43</span><span class="content">Then said I of her that was old in adulteries, Now will they play the harlot with her, and she with them. </span></span><span class="verse v44" data-usfm="EZK.23.44"><span class="label">44</span><span class="content">And they went in unto her, as they go in unto a harlot: so went they in unto Oholah and unto Oholibah, the lewd women. </span></span><span class="verse v45" data-usfm="EZK.23.45"><span class="label">45</span><span class="content">And righteous men, they shall judge them with the judgment of adulteresses, and with the judgment of women that shed blood; because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands. </span></span><span class="verse v46" data-usfm="EZK.23.46"><span class="label">46</span><span class="content">For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will bring up a company against them, and will give them to be tossed to and fro and robbed. </span></span><span class="verse v47" data-usfm="EZK.23.47"><span class="label">47</span><span class="content">And the company shall stone them with stones, and despatch them with their swords;
