Howbeit each man hath his own gift from God, one after this manner, and another after that. </span></span><span class="verse v8" data-usfm="1CO.7.8"><span class="label">8</span><span class="content">But I say to the unmarried and to widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I. </span></span><span class="verse v9" data-usfm="1CO.7.9"><span class="label">9</span><span class="content">But if they have not continency, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn. </span></span><span class="verse v10" data-usfm="1CO.7.10"><span class="label">10</span><span class="content">But unto the married I give charge, yea not I, but the Lord, That the wife depart not from her husband </span></span><span class="verse v11" data-usfm="1CO.7.11"><span class="label">11</span><span class="content">(but should she depart, let her remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband); and that the husband leave not his wife. </span></span><span class="verse v12" data-usfm="1CO.7.12"><span class="label">12</span><span class="content">But to the rest say I, not the Lord: If any brother hath an unbelieving wife, and she is content to dwell with him, let him not leave her. </span></span><span class="verse v13" data-usfm="1CO.7.13"><span class="label">13</span><span class="content">And the woman that hath an unbelieving husband, and he is content to dwell with her, let her not leave her husband. </span></span><span class="verse v14" data-usfm="1CO.7.14"><span class="label">14</span><span class="content">For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the brother: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy. </span></span><span class="verse v15" data-usfm="1CO.7.15"><span class="label">15</span><span class="content">Yet if the unbelieving departeth, let him depart: the brother or the sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called us in peace. </span></span><span class="verse v16" data-usfm="1CO.7.16"><span class="label">16</span><span class="content">For how knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? Or how knowest thou, O husband, whether thou shalt save thy wife? </span></span><span class="verse v17" data-usfm="1CO.7.17"><span class="label">17</span><span class="content">Only, as the Lord hath distributed to each man, as God hath called each, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all the churches. </span></span><span class="verse v18" data-usfm="1CO.7.18"><span class="label">18</span><span class="content">Was any man called being circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. Hath any been called in uncircumcision? Let him not be circumcised. </span></span><span class="verse v19" data-usfm="1CO.7.19"><span class="label">19</span><span class="content">Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing; but the keeping of the commandments of God. </span></span><span class="verse v20" data-usfm="1CO.7.20"><span class="label">20</span><span class="content">Let each man abide in that calling wherein he was called. </span></span><span class="verse v21" data-usfm="1CO.7.21"><span class="label">21</span><span class="content">Wast thou called being a bondservant? Care not for it: nay, even if thou canst become free, use it rather. </span></span><span class="verse v22" data-usfm="1CO.7.22"><span class="label">22</span><span class="content">For he that was called in the Lord being a bondservant, is the Lord&#8217;s freedman: likewise he that was called being free, is Christ&#8217;s bondservant. </span></span><span class="verse v23" data-usfm="1CO.7.23"><span class="label">23</span><span class="content">Ye were bought with a price; become not bondservants of men. </span></span><span class="verse v24" data-usfm="1CO.7.24"><span class="label">24</span><span class="content">Brethren, let each man, wherein he was called, therein abide with God. </span></span><span class="verse v25" data-usfm="1CO.7.25"><span class="label">25</span><span class="content">Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: but I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be trustworthy. </span></span><span class="verse v26" data-usfm="1CO.7.26"><span class="label">26</span><span class="content">I think therefore that this is good by reason of the distress that is upon us, namely, that it is good for a man to be as he is. </span></span><span class="verse v27" data-usfm="1CO.7.27"><span class="label">27</span><span class="content">Art thou bound unto a wife? Seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? Seek not a wife. </span></span><span class="verse v28" data-usfm="1CO.7.28"><span class="label">28</span><span class="content">But shouldest thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Yet such shall have tribulation in the flesh: and I would spare you. </span></span><span class="verse v29" data-usfm="1CO.7.29"><span class="label">29</span><span class="content">But this I say, brethren, the time is shortened, that henceforth both those that have wives may be as though they had none; </span></span><span class="verse v30" data-usfm="1CO.7.30"><span class="label">30</span><span class="content">and those that weep, as though they wept not; and those that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and those that buy, as though they possessed not; </span></span><span class="verse v31" data-usfm="1CO.7.31"><span class="label">31</span><span class="content">and those that use the world, as not using it to the full: for the fashion of this world passeth away. </span></span><span class="verse v32" data-usfm="1CO.7.32"><span class="label">32</span><span class="content">But I would have you to be free from cares. He that is unmarried is careful for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord: </span></span><span class="verse v33" data-usfm="1CO.7.33"><span class="label">33</span><span class="content">but he that is married is careful for the things of the world, how he may please his wife, </span></span><span class="verse v34" data-usfm="1CO.7.34"><span class="label">34</span><span class="content">and is divided. So also the woman that is unmarried and the virgin is careful for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married is careful for the things of the world, how she may please her husband. </span></span><span class="verse v35" data-usfm="1CO.7.35"><span class="label">35</span><span class="content">And this I say for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is seemly, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction. </span></span><span class="verse v36" data-usfm="1CO.7.36"><span class="label">36</span><span class="content">But if any man thinketh that he behaveth himself unseemly toward his virgin daughter, if she be past the flower of her age, and if need so requireth, let him do what he will; he sinneth not; let them marry. </span></span><span class="verse v37" data-usfm="1CO.7.37"><span class="label">37</span><span class="content">But he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power as touching in his own heart, to keep his own virgin daughter, shall do well. </span></span><span class="verse v38" data-usfm="1CO.7.38"><span class="label">38</span><span class="content">So then both he that giveth his own virgin daughter in marriage doeth well; and he that giveth her not in marriage shall do better. </span></span><span class="verse v39" data-usfm="1CO.7.39"><span class="label">39</span><span class="content">A wife is bound for so long time as her husband liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is free to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord. </span></span><span class="verse v40" data-usfm="1CO.7.40"><span class="label">40</span><span class="content">But she is happier if she abide as she is, after my judgment: and I think that I also have the Spirit of God. </span></span></div>
