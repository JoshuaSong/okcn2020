Then said I in my heart, that this also is vanity. </span></span><span class="verse v16" data-usfm="ECC.2.16"><span class="label">16</span><span class="content">For of the wise man, even as of the fool, there is no remembrance for ever; seeing that in the days to come all will have been long forgotten. And how doth the wise man die even as the fool! </span></span><span class="verse v17" data-usfm="ECC.2.17"><span class="label">17</span><span class="content">So I hated life, because the work that is wrought under the sun was grievous unto me; for all is vanity and a striving after wind. </span></span><span class="verse v18" data-usfm="ECC.2.18"><span class="label">18</span><span class="content">And I hated all my labor wherein I labored under the sun, seeing that I must leave it unto the man that shall be after me. </span></span><span class="verse v19" data-usfm="ECC.2.19"><span class="label">19</span><span class="content">And who knoweth whether he will be a wise man or a fool? yet will he have rule over all my labor wherein I have labored, and wherein I have showed myself wise under the sun. This also is vanity. </span></span><span class="verse v20" data-usfm="ECC.2.20"><span class="label">20</span><span class="content">Therefore I turned about to cause my heart to despair concerning all the labor wherein I had labored under the sun. </span></span><span class="verse v21" data-usfm="ECC.2.21"><span class="label">21</span><span class="content">For there is a man whose labor is with wisdom, and with knowledge, and with skilfulness; yet to a man that hath not labored therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil. </span></span><span class="verse v22" data-usfm="ECC.2.22"><span class="label">22</span><span class="content">For what hath a man of all his labor, and of the striving of his heart, wherein he laboreth under the sun? </span></span><span class="verse v23" data-usfm="ECC.2.23"><span class="label">23</span><span class="content">For all his days are but sorrows, and his travail is grief; yea, even in the night his heart taketh no rest. This also is vanity. </span></span><span class="verse v24" data-usfm="ECC.2.24"><span class="label">24</span><span class="content">There is nothing better for a man than that he should eat and drink, and make his soul enjoy good in his labor. This also I saw, that it is from the hand of God. </span></span><span class="verse v25" data-usfm="ECC.2.25"><span class="label">25</span><span class="content">For who can eat, or who can have enjoyment, more than I? </span></span><span class="verse v26" data-usfm="ECC.2.26"><span class="label">26</span><span class="content">For to the man that pleaseth him God giveth wisdom, and knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that pleaseth God. This also is vanity and a striving after wind. </span></span></div>
