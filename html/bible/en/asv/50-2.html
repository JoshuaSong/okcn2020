</span></span><span class="verse v3" data-usfm="PHP.2.3"><span class="label">3</span><span class="content">doing nothing through faction or through vainglory, but in lowliness of mind each counting other better than himself; </span></span><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="PHP.2.4"><span class="label">4</span><span class="content">not looking each of you to his own things, but each of you also to the things of others. </span></span><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="PHP.2.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content">Have this mind in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: </span></span><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="PHP.2.6"><span class="label">6</span><span class="content">who, existing in the form of God, counted not the being on an equality with God a thing to be grasped, </span></span><span class="verse v7" data-usfm="PHP.2.7"><span class="label">7</span><span class="content">but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men; </span></span><span class="verse v8" data-usfm="PHP.2.8"><span class="label">8</span><span class="content">and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, becoming obedient even unto death, yea, the death of the cross. </span></span><span class="verse v9" data-usfm="PHP.2.9"><span class="label">9</span><span class="content">Wherefore also God highly exalted him, and gave unto him the name which is above every name; </span></span><span class="verse v10" data-usfm="PHP.2.10"><span class="label">10</span><span class="content">that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven and things on earth and things under the earth, </span></span><span class="verse v11" data-usfm="PHP.2.11"><span class="label">11</span><span class="content">and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. </span></span><span class="verse v12" data-usfm="PHP.2.12"><span class="label">12</span><span class="content">So then, my beloved, even as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; </span></span><span class="verse v13" data-usfm="PHP.2.13"><span class="label">13</span><span class="content">for it is God who worketh in you both to will and to work, for his good pleasure. </span></span><span class="verse v14" data-usfm="PHP.2.14"><span class="label">14</span><span class="content">Do all things without murmurings and questionings: </span></span><span class="verse v15" data-usfm="PHP.2.15"><span class="label">15</span><span class="content">that ye may become blameless and harmless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom ye are seen as lights in the world, </span></span><span class="verse v16" data-usfm="PHP.2.16"><span class="label">16</span><span class="content">holding forth the word of life;

</span></span><span class="verse v26" data-usfm="PHP.2.26"><span class="label">26</span><span class="content">since he longed after you all, and was sore troubled, because ye had heard that he was sick: </span></span><span class="verse v27" data-usfm="PHP.2.27"><span class="label">27</span><span class="content">for indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow. </span></span><span class="verse v28" data-usfm="PHP.2.28"><span class="label">28</span><span class="content">I have sent him therefore the more diligently, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful. </span></span><span class="verse v29" data-usfm="PHP.2.29"><span class="label">29</span><span class="content">Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy; and hold such in honor: </span></span><span class="verse v30" data-usfm="PHP.2.30"><span class="label">30</span><span class="content">because for the work of Christ he came nigh unto death, hazarding his life to supply that which was lacking in your service toward me. </span></span></div>
