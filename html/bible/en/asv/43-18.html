Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, who betrayed him, was standing with them. </span></span><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="JHN.18.6"><span class="label">6</span><span class="content">When therefore he said unto them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground. </span></span><span class="verse v7" data-usfm="JHN.18.7"><span class="label">7</span><span class="content">Again therefore he asked them, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth. </span></span><span class="verse v8" data-usfm="JHN.18.8"><span class="label">8</span><span class="content">Jesus answered, I told you that I am he; if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way: </span></span><span class="verse v9" data-usfm="JHN.18.9"><span class="label">9</span><span class="content">that the word might be fulfilled which he spake, Of those whom thou hast given me I lost not one. </span></span><span class="verse v10" data-usfm="JHN.18.10"><span class="label">10</span><span class="content">Simon Peter therefore having a sword drew it, and struck the high priest&#8217;s servant, and cut off his right ear. Now the servant&#8217;s name was Malchus. </span></span><span class="verse v11" data-usfm="JHN.18.11"><span class="label">11</span><span class="content">Jesus therefore said unto Peter, Put up the sword into the sheath: the cup which the Father hath given me, shall I not drink it? </span></span><span class="verse v12" data-usfm="JHN.18.12"><span class="label">12</span><span class="content">So the band and the chief captain, and the officers of the Jews, seized Jesus and bound him, </span></span><span class="verse v13" data-usfm="JHN.18.13"><span class="label">13</span><span class="content">and led him to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, who was high priest that year. </span></span><span class="verse v14" data-usfm="JHN.18.14"><span class="label">14</span><span class="content">Now Caiaphas was he that gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people. </span></span><span class="verse v15" data-usfm="JHN.18.15"><span class="label">15</span><span class="content">And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple.

Ask them that have heard me, what I spake unto them: behold, these know the things which I said. </span></span><span class="verse v22" data-usfm="JHN.18.22"><span class="label">22</span><span class="content">And when he had said this, one of the officers standing by struck Jesus with his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so? </span></span><span class="verse v23" data-usfm="JHN.18.23"><span class="label">23</span><span class="content">Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me? </span></span><span class="verse v24" data-usfm="JHN.18.24"><span class="label">24</span><span class="content">Annas therefore sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest. </span></span><span class="verse v25" data-usfm="JHN.18.25"><span class="label">25</span><span class="content">Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They said therefore unto him, Art thou also one of his disciples?

The Jews said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death: </span></span><span class="verse v32" data-usfm="JHN.18.32"><span class="label">32</span><span class="content">that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying by what manner of death he should die. </span></span><span class="verse v33" data-usfm="JHN.18.33"><span class="label">33</span><span class="content">Pilate therefore entered again into the Praetorium, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews? </span></span><span class="verse v34" data-usfm="JHN.18.34"><span class="label">34</span><span class="content">Jesus answered, Sayest thou this of thyself, or did others tell it thee concerning me? </span></span><span class="verse v35" data-usfm="JHN.18.35"><span class="label">35</span><span class="content">Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done? </span></span><span class="verse v36" data-usfm="JHN.18.36"><span class="label">36</span><span class="content">Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence. </span></span><span class="verse v37" data-usfm="JHN.18.37"><span class="label">37</span><span class="content">Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end have I been born, and to this end am I come into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice. </span></span><span class="verse v38" data-usfm="JHN.18.38"><span class="label">38</span><span class="content">Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find no crime in him. </span></span><span class="verse v39" data-usfm="JHN.18.39"><span class="label">39</span><span class="content">But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews? </span></span><span class="verse v40" data-usfm="JHN.18.40"><span class="label">40</span><span class="content">They cried out therefore again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.) </span></span></div>
