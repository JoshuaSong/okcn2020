I did neither eat bread nor drink water. </span></span><span class="verse v10" data-usfm="DEU.9.10"><span class="label">10</span><span class="content">And Jehovah delivered unto me the two tables of stone written with the finger of God;

for thy people that thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image. </span></span><span class="verse v13" data-usfm="DEU.9.13"><span class="label">13</span><span class="content">Furthermore Jehovah spake unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people: </span></span><span class="verse v14" data-usfm="DEU.9.14"><span class="label">14</span><span class="content">let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven; and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they. </span></span><span class="verse v15" data-usfm="DEU.9.15"><span class="label">15</span><span class="content">So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount was burning with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands. </span></span><span class="verse v16" data-usfm="DEU.9.16"><span class="label">16</span><span class="content">And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against Jehovah your God;
