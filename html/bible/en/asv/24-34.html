and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name: </span></span><span class="verse v16" data-usfm="JER.34.16"><span class="label">16</span><span class="content">but ye turned and profaned my name, and caused every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom ye had let go free at their pleasure, to return; and ye brought them into subjection, to be unto you for servants and for handmaids. </span></span><span class="verse v17" data-usfm="JER.34.17"><span class="label">17</span><span class="content">Therefore thus saith Jehovah: ye have not hearkened unto me, to proclaim liberty, every man to his brother, and every man to his neighbor: behold, I proclaim unto you a liberty, saith Jehovah, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine;
