and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him. </span></span><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="JDG.19.4"><span class="label">4</span><span class="content">And his father-in-law, the damsel&#8217;s father, retained him; and he abode with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and lodged there. </span></span><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="JDG.19.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content">And it came to pass on the fourth day, that they arose early in the morning, and he rose up to depart: and the damsel&#8217;s father said unto his son-in-law, Strengthen thy heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward ye shall go your way. </span></span><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="JDG.19.6"><span class="label">6</span><span class="content">So they sat down, and did eat and drink, both of them together: and the damsel&#8217;s father said unto the man, Be pleased, I pray thee, to tarry all night, and let thy heart be merry. </span></span><span class="verse v7" data-usfm="JDG.19.7"><span class="label">7</span><span class="content">And the man rose up to depart; but his father-in-law urged him, and he lodged there again. </span></span><span class="verse v8" data-usfm="JDG.19.8"><span class="label">8</span><span class="content">And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart; and the damsel&#8217;s father said, Strengthen thy heart, I pray thee, and tarry ye until the day declineth; and they did eat, both of them. </span></span><span class="verse v9" data-usfm="JDG.19.9"><span class="label">9</span><span class="content">And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father-in-law, the damsel&#8217;s father, said unto him, Behold, now the day draweth toward evening, I pray you tarry all night: behold, the day groweth to an end, lodge here, that thy heart may be merry; and to-morrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest go home. </span></span></div><div class="p"><span class="verse v9" data-usfm="JDG.19.9"><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v10" data-usfm="JDG.19.10"><span class="label">10</span><span class="content">But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and departed, and came over against Jebus (the same is Jerusalem): and there were with him a couple of asses saddled; his concubine also was with him. </span></span><span class="verse v11" data-usfm="JDG.19.11"><span class="label">11</span><span class="content">When they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said unto his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us turn aside into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it. </span></span><span class="verse v12" data-usfm="JDG.19.12"><span class="label">12</span><span class="content">And his master said unto him, We will not turn aside into the city of a foreigner, that is not of the children of Israel; but we will pass over to Gibeah. </span></span><span class="verse v13" data-usfm="JDG.19.13"><span class="label">13</span><span class="content">And he said unto his servant, Come and let us draw near to one of these places; and we will lodge in Gibeah, or in Ramah. </span></span><span class="verse v14" data-usfm="JDG.19.14"><span class="label">14</span><span class="content">So they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down upon them near to Gibeah, which belongeth to Benjamin. </span></span><span class="verse v15" data-usfm="JDG.19.15"><span class="label">15</span><span class="content">And they turned aside thither, to go in to lodge in Gibeah: and he went in, and sat him down in the street of the city;

but the men of the place were Benjamites. </span></span><span class="verse v17" data-usfm="JDG.19.17"><span class="label">17</span><span class="content">And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the wayfaring man in the street of the city; and the old man said, Whither goest thou? and whence comest thou? </span></span><span class="verse v18" data-usfm="JDG.19.18"><span class="label">18</span><span class="content">And he said unto him, We are passing from Beth-lehem-judah unto the farther side of the hill-country of Ephraim; from thence am I, and I went to Beth-lehem-judah: and I am now going to the house of Jehovah; and there is no man that taketh me into his house. </span></span><span class="verse v19" data-usfm="JDG.19.19"><span class="label">19</span><span class="content">Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and for the young man that is with thy servants: there is no want of anything. </span></span><span class="verse v20" data-usfm="JDG.19.20"><span class="label">20</span><span class="content">And the old man said, Peace be unto thee; howsoever let all thy wants lie upon me; only lodge not in the street. </span></span><span class="verse v21" data-usfm="JDG.19.21"><span class="label">21</span><span class="content">So he brought him into his house, and gave the asses fodder;

seeing that this man is come into my house, do not this folly. </span></span><span class="verse v24" data-usfm="JDG.19.24"><span class="label">24</span><span class="content">Behold, here is my daughter a virgin, and his concubine; them I will bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what seemeth good unto you: but unto this man do not any such folly. </span></span><span class="verse v25" data-usfm="JDG.19.25"><span class="label">25</span><span class="content">But the men would not hearken to him: so the man laid hold on his concubine, and brought her forth unto them; and they knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let her go. </span></span><span class="verse v26" data-usfm="JDG.19.26"><span class="label">26</span><span class="content">Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man&#8217;s house where her lord was, till it was light. </span></span></div><div class="p"><span class="verse v26" data-usfm="JDG.19.26"><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v27" data-usfm="JDG.19.27"><span class="label">27</span><span class="content">And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way; and, behold, the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, with her hands upon the threshold. </span></span><span class="verse v28" data-usfm="JDG.19.28"><span class="label">28</span><span class="content">And he said unto her, Up, and let us be going; but none answered: then he took her up upon the ass; and the man rose up, and gat him unto his place. </span></span><span class="verse v29" data-usfm="JDG.19.29"><span class="label">29</span><span class="content">And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, limb by limb, into twelve pieces, and sent her throughout all the borders of Israel. </span></span><span class="verse v30" data-usfm="JDG.19.30"><span class="label">30</span><span class="content">And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt unto this day: consider it, take counsel, and speak. </span></span></div>
