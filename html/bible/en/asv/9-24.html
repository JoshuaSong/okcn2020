Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul&#8217;s robe privily. </span></span><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="1SA.24.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content">And it came to pass afterward, that David&#8217;s heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul&#8217;s skirt. </span></span><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="1SA.24.6"><span class="label">6</span><span class="content">And he said unto his men, Jehovah forbid that I should do this thing unto my lord, Jehovah&#8217;s anointed, to put forth my hand against him, seeing he is Jehovah&#8217;s anointed. </span></span><span class="verse v7" data-usfm="1SA.24.7"><span class="label">7</span><span class="content">So David checked his men with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul.
