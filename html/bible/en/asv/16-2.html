Now I had not been beforetime sad in his presence. </span></span><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="NEH.2.2"><span class="label">2</span><span class="content">And the king said unto me, Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart.

So I prayed to the God of heaven. </span></span><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="NEH.2.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content">And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy servant have found favor in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers&#8217; sepulchres, that I may build it. </span></span><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="NEH.2.6"><span class="label">6</span><span class="content">And the king said unto me (the queen also sitting by him,) For how long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou return?
