Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. </span></span><span class="verse v10" data-usfm="2CO.12.10"><span class="label">10</span><span class="content">Wherefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ&#8217;s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong. </span></span><span class="verse v11" data-usfm="2CO.12.11"><span class="label">11</span><span class="content">I am become foolish: ye compelled me; for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing was I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I am nothing. </span></span><span class="verse v12" data-usfm="2CO.12.12"><span class="label">12</span><span class="content">Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, by signs and wonders and mighty works. </span></span><span class="verse v13" data-usfm="2CO.12.13"><span class="label">13</span><span class="content">For what is there wherein ye were made inferior to the rest of the churches, except it be that I myself was not a burden to you? forgive me this wrong. </span></span><span class="verse v14" data-usfm="2CO.12.14"><span class="label">14</span><span class="content">Behold, this is the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be a burden to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children. </span></span><span class="verse v15" data-usfm="2CO.12.15"><span class="label">15</span><span class="content">And I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more abundantly, am I loved the less? </span></span><span class="verse v16" data-usfm="2CO.12.16"><span class="label">16</span><span class="content">But be it so, I did not myself burden you; but, being crafty, I caught you with guile. </span></span><span class="verse v17" data-usfm="2CO.12.17"><span class="label">17</span><span class="content">Did I take advantage of you by any one of them whom I have sent unto you? </span></span><span class="verse v18" data-usfm="2CO.12.18"><span class="label">18</span><span class="content">I exhorted Titus, and I sent the brother with him. Did Titus take any advantage of you? walked we not in the same spirit? </span></span><span class="verse v19" data-usfm="2CO.12.19"><span class="label">19</span><span class="content">Ye think all this time that we are excusing ourselves unto you. In the sight of God speak we in Christ. But all things, beloved, </span></span><span class="verse v20" data-usfm="2CO.12.20"><span class="label">20</span><span class="content">For I fear, lest by any means, when I come, I should find you not such as I would, and should myself be found of you such as ye would not; lest by any means there should be strife, jealousy, wraths, factions, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults; </span></span><span class="verse v21" data-usfm="2CO.12.21"><span class="label">21</span><span class="content">lest again when I come my God should humble me before you, and I should mourn for many of them that have sinned heretofore, and repented not of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they committed. </span></span></div>
