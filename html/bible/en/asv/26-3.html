Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness. </span></span><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="EZK.3.4"><span class="label">4</span><span class="content">And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them. </span></span><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="EZK.3.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content">For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of a hard language, but to the house of Israel; </span></span><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="EZK.3.6"><span class="label">6</span><span class="content">not to many peoples of a strange speech and of a hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, if I sent thee to them, they would hearken unto thee. </span></span><span class="verse v7" data-usfm="EZK.3.7"><span class="label">7</span><span class="content">But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel are of hard forehead and of a stiff heart. </span></span><span class="verse v8" data-usfm="EZK.3.8"><span class="label">8</span><span class="content">Behold, I have made thy face hard against their faces, and thy forehead hard against their foreheads. </span></span><span class="verse v9" data-usfm="EZK.3.9"><span class="label">9</span><span class="content">As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house. </span></span><span class="verse v10" data-usfm="EZK.3.10"><span class="label">10</span><span class="content">Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thy heart, and hear with thine ears. </span></span><span class="verse v11" data-usfm="EZK.3.11"><span class="label">11</span><span class="content">And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah;

and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thy hand. </span></span><span class="verse v19" data-usfm="EZK.3.19"><span class="label">19</span><span class="content">Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity;

but his blood will I require at thy hand. </span></span><span class="verse v21" data-usfm="EZK.3.21"><span class="label">21</span><span class="content">Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he took warning; and thou hast delivered thy soul. </span></span><span class="verse v22" data-usfm="EZK.3.22"><span class="label">22</span><span class="content">And the hand of Jehovah was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee. </span></span><span class="verse v23" data-usfm="EZK.3.23"><span class="label">23</span><span class="content">Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of Jehovah stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face. </span></span><span class="verse v24" data-usfm="EZK.3.24"><span class="label">24</span><span class="content">Then the Spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet; and he spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thy house. </span></span><span class="verse v25" data-usfm="EZK.3.25"><span class="label">25</span><span class="content">But thou, son of man, behold, they shall lay bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them: </span></span><span class="verse v26" data-usfm="EZK.3.26"><span class="label">26</span><span class="content">and I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover; for they are a rebellious house. </span></span><span class="verse v27" data-usfm="EZK.3.27"><span class="label">27</span><span class="content">But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house. </span></span></div>
