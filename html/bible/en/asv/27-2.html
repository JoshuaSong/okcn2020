and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth. </span></span><span class="verse v40" data-usfm="DAN.2.40"><span class="label">40</span><span class="content">And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron, forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things; and as iron that crusheth all these, shall it break in pieces and crush. </span></span><span class="verse v41" data-usfm="DAN.2.41"><span class="label">41</span><span class="content">And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters&#8217; clay, and part of iron, it shall be a divided kingdom; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay. </span></span><span class="verse v42" data-usfm="DAN.2.42"><span class="label">42</span><span class="content">And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken. </span></span><span class="verse v43" data-usfm="DAN.2.43"><span class="label">43</span><span class="content">And whereas thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men; but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron doth not mingle with clay. </span></span><span class="verse v44" data-usfm="DAN.2.44"><span class="label">44</span><span class="content">And in the days of those kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed, nor shall the sovereignty thereof be left to another people; but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever. </span></span><span class="verse v45" data-usfm="DAN.2.45"><span class="label">45</span><span class="content">Forasmuch as thou sawest that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure. </span></span><span class="verse v46" data-usfm="DAN.2.46"><span class="label">46</span><span class="content">Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odors unto him. </span></span><span class="verse v47" data-usfm="DAN.2.47"><span class="label">47</span><span class="content">The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth your God is the God of gods, and the Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou hast been able to reveal this secret. </span></span><span class="verse v48" data-usfm="DAN.2.48"><span class="label">48</span><span class="content">Then the king made Daniel great, and gave him many great gifts, and made him to rule over the whole province of Babylon, and to be chief governor over all the wise men of Babylon. </span></span><span class="verse v49" data-usfm="DAN.2.49"><span class="label">49</span><span class="content">And Daniel requested of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel was in the gate of the king. </span></span></div>
