And the word of Jehovah was precious in those days; there was no frequent vision. </span></span><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="1SA.3.2"><span class="label">2</span><span class="content">And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place (now his eyes had begun to wax dim, so that he could not see), </span></span><span class="verse v3" data-usfm="1SA.3.3"><span class="label">3</span><span class="content">and the lamp of God was not yet gone out, and Samuel was laid down to sleep, in the temple of Jehovah, where the ark of God was; </span></span><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="1SA.3.4"><span class="label">4</span><span class="content">that Jehovah called Samuel; and he said, Here am I. </span></span><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="1SA.3.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content">And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down. </span></span><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="1SA.3.6"><span class="label">6</span><span class="content">And Jehovah called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again. </span></span><span class="verse v7" data-usfm="1SA.3.7"><span class="label">7</span><span class="content">Now Samuel did not yet know Jehovah, neither was the word of Jehovah yet revealed unto him. </span></span><span class="verse v8" data-usfm="1SA.3.8"><span class="label">8</span><span class="content">And Jehovah called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And Eli perceived that Jehovah had called the child. </span></span><span class="verse v9" data-usfm="1SA.3.9"><span class="label">9</span><span class="content">Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, Jehovah; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place. </span></span></div><div class="p"><span class="verse v9" data-usfm="1SA.3.9"><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v10" data-usfm="1SA.3.10"><span class="label">10</span><span class="content">And Jehovah came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel said, Speak; for thy servant heareth. </span></span><span class="verse v11" data-usfm="1SA.3.11"><span class="label">11</span><span class="content">And Jehovah said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle. </span></span><span class="verse v12" data-usfm="1SA.3.12"><span class="label">12</span><span class="content">In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from the beginning even unto the end. </span></span><span class="verse v13" data-usfm="1SA.3.13"><span class="label">13</span><span class="content">For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever, for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons did bring a curse upon themselves, and he restrained them not. </span></span><span class="verse v14" data-usfm="1SA.3.14"><span class="label">14</span><span class="content">And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli&#8217;s house shall not be expiated with sacrifice nor offering for ever. </span></span></div><div class="p"><span class="verse v14" data-usfm="1SA.3.14"><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v15" data-usfm="1SA.3.15"><span class="label">15</span><span class="content">And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of Jehovah. And Samuel feared to show Eli the vision. </span></span><span class="verse v16" data-usfm="1SA.3.16"><span class="label">16</span><span class="content">Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he said, Here am I. </span></span><span class="verse v17" data-usfm="1SA.3.17"><span class="label">17</span><span class="content">And he said, What is the thing that Jehovah hath spoken unto thee? I pray thee, hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide anything from me of all the things that he spake unto thee. </span></span><span class="verse v18" data-usfm="1SA.3.18"><span class="label">18</span><span class="content">And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him.
