And I held a great assembly against them. </span></span><span class="verse v8" data-usfm="NEH.5.8"><span class="label">8</span><span class="content">And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, that were sold unto the nations; and would ye even sell your brethren, and should they be sold unto us? Then held they their peace, and found never a word. </span></span><span class="verse v9" data-usfm="NEH.5.9"><span class="label">9</span><span class="content">Also I said, The thing that ye do is not good: ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God, because of the reproach of the nations our enemies? </span></span><span class="verse v10" data-usfm="NEH.5.10"><span class="label">10</span><span class="content">And I likewise, my brethren and my servants, do lend them money and grain. I pray you, let us leave off this usury. </span></span><span class="verse v11" data-usfm="NEH.5.11"><span class="label">11</span><span class="content">Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their fields, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them. </span></span><span class="verse v12" data-usfm="NEH.5.12"><span class="label">12</span><span class="content">Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do, even as thou sayest.

And all the assembly said, Amen, and praised Jehovah. And the people did according to this promise. </span></span><span class="verse v14" data-usfm="NEH.5.14"><span class="label">14</span><span class="content">Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor. </span></span><span class="verse v15" data-usfm="NEH.5.15"><span class="label">15</span><span class="content">But the former governors that were before me were chargeable unto the people, and took of them bread and wine, besides forty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants bare rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the fear of God. </span></span><span class="verse v16" data-usfm="NEH.5.16"><span class="label">16</span><span class="content">Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work. </span></span><span class="verse v17" data-usfm="NEH.5.17"><span class="label">17</span><span class="content">Moreover there were at my table, of the Jews and the rulers, a hundred and fifty men, besides those that came unto us from among the nations that were round about us. </span></span><span class="verse v18" data-usfm="NEH.5.18"><span class="label">18</span><span class="content">Now that which was prepared for one day was one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this I demanded not the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people. </span></span><span class="verse v19" data-usfm="NEH.5.19"><span class="label">19</span><span class="content">Remember unto me, O my God, for good, all that I have done for this people. </span></span></div>
