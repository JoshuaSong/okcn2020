For it is one and the same thing as if she were shaved. </span></span><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="1CO.11.6"><span class="label">6</span><span class="content">For if a woman is not covered, let her also be shorn. But if it is shameful for a woman to be shorn or shaved, let her be covered. </span></span><span class="verse v7" data-usfm="1CO.11.7"><span class="label">7</span><span class="content">For a man indeed ought not to have his head covered, because he is the image and glory of God, but the woman is the glory of the man. </span></span><span class="verse v8" data-usfm="1CO.11.8"><span class="label">8</span><span class="content">For man is not from woman, but woman from man; </span></span><span class="verse v9" data-usfm="1CO.11.9"><span class="label">9</span><span class="content">for neither was man created for the woman, but woman for the man. </span></span><span class="verse v10" data-usfm="1CO.11.10"><span class="label">10</span><span class="content">For this cause the woman ought to have authority on her head, because of the angels.</span></span></div><div class="p"><span class="verse v10" data-usfm="1CO.11.10"><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v11" data-usfm="1CO.11.11"><span class="label">11</span><span class="content">Nevertheless, neither is the woman independent of the man, nor the man independent of the woman, in the Lord. </span></span><span class="verse v12" data-usfm="1CO.11.12"><span class="label">12</span><span class="content">For as woman came from man, so a man also comes through a woman; but all things are from God. </span></span><span class="verse v13" data-usfm="1CO.11.13"><span class="label">13</span><span class="content">Judge for yourselves.
