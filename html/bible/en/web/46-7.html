Likewise also the husband doesn&#8217;t have authority over his own body, but the wife. </span></span><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="1CO.7.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content">Don&#8217;t deprive one another, unless it is by consent for a season, that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer, and may be together again, that Satan doesn&#8217;t tempt you because of your lack of self-control.</span></span></div><div class="p"><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="1CO.7.5"><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="1CO.7.6"><span class="label">6</span><span class="content">But this I say by way of concession, not of commandment. </span></span><span class="verse v7" data-usfm="1CO.7.7"><span class="label">7</span><span class="content">Yet I wish that all men were like me. However each man has his own gift from God, one of this kind, and another of that kind. </span></span><span class="verse v8" data-usfm="1CO.7.8"><span class="label">8</span><span class="content">But I say to the unmarried and to widows, it is good for them if they remain even as I am. </span></span><span class="verse v9" data-usfm="1CO.7.9"><span class="label">9</span><span class="content">But if they don&#8217;t have self-control, let them marry.

Otherwise your children would be unclean, but now they are holy. </span></span><span class="verse v15" data-usfm="1CO.7.15"><span class="label">15</span><span class="content">Yet if the unbeliever departs, let there be separation. The brother or the sister is not under bondage in such cases, but God has called us in peace. </span></span><span class="verse v16" data-usfm="1CO.7.16"><span class="label">16</span><span class="content">For how do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife? </span></span><span class="verse v17" data-usfm="1CO.7.17"><span class="label">17</span><span class="content">Only, as the Lord has distributed to each man, as God has called each, so let him walk.

Let him not be circumcised. </span></span><span class="verse v19" data-usfm="1CO.7.19"><span class="label">19</span><span class="content">Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God. </span></span><span class="verse v20" data-usfm="1CO.7.20"><span class="label">20</span><span class="content">Let each man stay in that calling in which he was called. </span></span><span class="verse v21" data-usfm="1CO.7.21"><span class="label">21</span><span class="content">Were you called being a bondservant? Don&#8217;t let that bother you, but if you get an opportunity to become free, use it. </span></span><span class="verse v22" data-usfm="1CO.7.22"><span class="label">22</span><span class="content">For he who was called in the Lord being a bondservant is the Lord&#8217;s free man. Likewise he who was called being free is Christ&#8217;s bondservant. </span></span><span class="verse v23" data-usfm="1CO.7.23"><span class="label">23</span><span class="content">You were bought with a price.

Don&#8217;t seek to be freed. Are you free from a wife? Don&#8217;t seek a wife. </span></span><span class="verse v28" data-usfm="1CO.7.28"><span class="label">28</span><span class="content">But if you marry, you have not sinned. If a virgin marries, she has not sinned. Yet such will have oppression in the flesh, and I want to spare you. </span></span><span class="verse v29" data-usfm="1CO.7.29"><span class="label">29</span><span class="content">But I say this, brothers: the time is short, that from now on, both those who have wives may be as though they had none; </span></span><span class="verse v30" data-usfm="1CO.7.30"><span class="label">30</span><span class="content">and those who weep, as though they didn&#8217;t weep; and those who rejoice, as though they didn&#8217;t rejoice; and those who buy, as though they didn&#8217;t possess; </span></span><span class="verse v31" data-usfm="1CO.7.31"><span class="label">31</span><span class="content">and those who use the world, as not using it to the fullest. For the mode of this world passes away. </span></span><span class="verse v32" data-usfm="1CO.7.32"><span class="label">32</span><span class="content">But I desire to have you to be free from cares. He who is unmarried is concerned for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord; </span></span><span class="verse v33" data-usfm="1CO.7.33"><span class="label">33</span><span class="content">but he who is married is concerned about the things of the world, how he may please his wife. </span></span><span class="verse v34" data-usfm="1CO.7.34"><span class="label">34</span><span class="content">There is also a difference between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman cares about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But she who is married cares about the things of the world&#8212;how she may please her husband. </span></span><span class="verse v35" data-usfm="1CO.7.35"><span class="label">35</span><span class="content">This I say for your own profit; not that I may ensnare you, but for that which is appropriate, and that you may attend to the Lord without distraction. </span></span><span class="verse v36" data-usfm="1CO.7.36"><span class="label">36</span><span class="content">But if any man thinks that he is behaving inappropriately toward his virgin, if she is past the flower of her age, and if need so requires, let him do what he desires. He doesn&#8217;t sin. Let them marry. </span></span><span class="verse v37" data-usfm="1CO.7.37"><span class="label">37</span><span class="content">But he who stands steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but has power over his own heart, to keep his own virgin, does well. </span></span><span class="verse v38" data-usfm="1CO.7.38"><span class="label">38</span><span class="content">So then both he who gives his own virgin in marriage does well, and he who doesn&#8217;t give her in marriage does better. </span></span><span class="verse v39" data-usfm="1CO.7.39"><span class="label">39</span><span class="content">A wife is bound by law for as long as her husband lives; but if the husband is dead, she is free to be married to whomever she desires, only in the Lord. </span></span><span class="verse v40" data-usfm="1CO.7.40"><span class="label">40</span><span class="content">But she is happier if she stays as she is, in my judgment, and I think that I also have God&#8217;s Spirit.</span></span></div>
