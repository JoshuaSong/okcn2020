Indeed, I have cursed them already, because you do not lay it to heart. </span></span><span class="verse v3" data-usfm="MAL.2.3"><span class="label">3</span><span class="content">Behold, I will rebuke your seed, and will spread dung on your faces, even the dung of your feasts; and you will be taken away with it. </span></span><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="MAL.2.4"><span class="label">4</span><span class="content">You will know that I have sent this commandment to you, that my covenant may be with Levi,&#8221; says Yahweh of Armies. </span></span><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="MAL.2.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content">&#8220;My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him that he might be reverent toward me; and he was reverent toward me, and stood in awe of my name. </span></span><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="MAL.2.6"><span class="label">6</span><span class="content">The law of truth was in his mouth, and unrighteousness was not found in his lips. He walked with me in peace and uprightness, and turned many away from iniquity. </span></span><span class="verse v7" data-usfm="MAL.2.7"><span class="label">7</span><span class="content">For the priest&#8217;s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth; for he is the messenger of Yahweh of Armies. </span></span><span class="verse v8" data-usfm="MAL.2.8"><span class="label">8</span><span class="content">But you have turned aside out of the way.
