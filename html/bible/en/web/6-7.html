The hearts of the people melted, and became like water. </span></span><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="JOS.7.6"><span class="label">6</span><span class="content">Joshua tore his clothes, and fell to the earth on his face before the ark of Yahweh until the evening, he and the elders of Israel; and they put dust on their heads. </span></span><span class="verse v7" data-usfm="JOS.7.7"><span class="label">7</span><span class="content">Joshua said, &#8220;Alas, Lord Yahweh, why have you brought this people over the Jordan at all, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to cause us to perish? I wish that we had been content and lived beyond the Jordan! </span></span><span class="verse v8" data-usfm="JOS.7.8"><span class="label">8</span><span class="content">Oh, Lord, what shall I say, after that Israel has turned their backs before their enemies! </span></span><span class="verse v9" data-usfm="JOS.7.9"><span class="label">9</span><span class="content">For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and will surround us, and cut off our name from the earth.
