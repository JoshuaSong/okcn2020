for we are left but a few of many, as your eyes do see us: </span></span><span class="verse v3" data-usfm="JER.42.3"><span class="label">3</span><span class="content">that Yahweh your God may show us the way in which we should walk, and the thing that we should do. </span></span><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="JER.42.4"><span class="label">4</span><span class="content">Then Jeremiah the prophet said to them, I have heard you;

</span></span><span class="verse v16" data-usfm="JER.42.16"><span class="label">16</span><span class="content">then it shall happen, that the sword, which you fear, shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt; and the famine, about which you are afraid, shall follow close behind you there in Egypt; and there you shall die. </span></span><span class="verse v17" data-usfm="JER.42.17"><span class="label">17</span><span class="content">So shall it be with all the men who set their faces to go into Egypt to live there: they shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring on them. </span></span><span class="verse v18" data-usfm="JER.42.18"><span class="label">18</span><span class="content">For thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel: As my anger and my wrath has been poured forth on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so shall my wrath be poured forth on you, when you shall enter into Egypt;

for you sent me to Yahweh your God, saying, Pray for us to Yahweh our God; and according to all that Yahweh our God shall say, so declare to us, and we will do it: </span></span><span class="verse v21" data-usfm="JER.42.21"><span class="label">21</span><span class="content">and I have this day declared it to you; but you have not obeyed the voice of Yahweh your God in anything for which he has sent me to you. </span></span><span class="verse v22" data-usfm="JER.42.22"><span class="label">22</span><span class="content">Now therefore know certainly that you shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, in the place where you desire to go to live there.</span></span></div>
