For I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord. </span></span><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="2CO.12.2"><span class="label">2</span><span class="content">I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I don&#8217;t know, or whether out of the body, I don&#8217;t know; God knows), such a one caught up into the third heaven. </span></span><span class="verse v3" data-usfm="2CO.12.3"><span class="label">3</span><span class="content">I know such a man (whether in the body, or outside of the body, I don&#8217;t know; God knows), </span></span><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="2CO.12.4"><span class="label">4</span><span class="content">how he was caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter. </span></span><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="2CO.12.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content">On behalf of such a one I will boast, but on my own behalf I will not boast, except in my weaknesses. </span></span><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="2CO.12.6"><span class="label">6</span><span class="content">For if I would desire to boast, I will not be foolish; for I will speak the truth. But I refrain, so that no man may think more of me than that which he sees in me, or hears from me. </span></span><span class="verse v7" data-usfm="2CO.12.7"><span class="label">7</span><span class="content">By reason of the exceeding greatness of the revelations, that I should not be exalted excessively, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me, that I should not be exalted excessively. </span></span><span class="verse v8" data-usfm="2CO.12.8"><span class="label">8</span><span class="content">Concerning this thing, I begged the Lord three times that it might depart from me. </span></span><span class="verse v9" data-usfm="2CO.12.9"><span class="label">9</span><span class="content">He has said to me, </span><span class="wj"><span class="content">&#8220;My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.&#8221;</span></span><span class="content"> Most gladly therefore I will rather glory in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest on me.</span></span></div><div class="p"><span class="verse v9" data-usfm="2CO.12.9"><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v10" data-usfm="2CO.12.10"><span class="label">10</span><span class="content">Therefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ&#8217;s sake. For when I am weak, then am I strong. </span></span><span class="verse v11" data-usfm="2CO.12.11"><span class="label">11</span><span class="content">I have become foolish in boasting. You compelled me, for I ought to have been commended by you, for in nothing was I inferior to the very best apostles, though I am nothing. </span></span><span class="verse v12" data-usfm="2CO.12.12"><span class="label">12</span><span class="content">Truly the signs of an apostle were worked among you in all patience, in signs and wonders and mighty works. </span></span><span class="verse v13" data-usfm="2CO.12.13"><span class="label">13</span><span class="content">For what is there in which you were made inferior to the rest of the assemblies, unless it is that I myself was not a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong.</span></span></div><div class="p"><span class="verse v13" data-usfm="2CO.12.13"><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v14" data-usfm="2CO.12.14"><span class="label">14</span><span class="content">Behold, this is the third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden to you; for I seek not your possessions, but you. For the children ought not to save up for the parents, but the parents for the children. </span></span><span class="verse v15" data-usfm="2CO.12.15"><span class="label">15</span><span class="content">I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more abundantly, am I loved the less? </span></span><span class="verse v16" data-usfm="2CO.12.16"><span class="label">16</span><span class="content">But be it so, I did not myself burden you. But, being crafty, I caught you with deception. </span></span><span class="verse v17" data-usfm="2CO.12.17"><span class="label">17</span><span class="content">Did I take advantage of you by anyone of them whom I have sent to you? </span></span><span class="verse v18" data-usfm="2CO.12.18"><span class="label">18</span><span class="content">I exhorted Titus, and I sent the brother with him. Did Titus take any advantage of you? Didn&#8217;t we walk in the same spirit? Didn&#8217;t we walk in the same steps? </span></span><span class="verse v19" data-usfm="2CO.12.19"><span class="label">19</span><span class="content">Again, do you think that we are excusing ourselves to you? In the sight of God we speak in Christ. But all things, beloved, are for your edifying. </span></span><span class="verse v20" data-usfm="2CO.12.20"><span class="label">20</span><span class="content">For I am afraid that by any means, when I come, I might find you not the way I want to, and that I might be found by you as you don&#8217;t desire; that by any means there would be strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, factions, slander, whisperings, proud thoughts, riots; </span></span><span class="verse v21" data-usfm="2CO.12.21"><span class="label">21</span><span class="content">that again when I come my God would humble me before you, and I would mourn for many of those who have sinned before now, and not repented of the uncleanness and sexual immorality and lustfulness which they committed.</span></span></div>
