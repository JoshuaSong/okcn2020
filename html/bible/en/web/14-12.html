The people were without number who came with him out of Egypt: the Lubim, the Sukkiim, and the Ethiopians. </span></span><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="2CH.12.4"><span class="label">4</span><span class="content">He took the fortified cities which pertained to Judah, and came to Jerusalem. </span></span><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="2CH.12.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content">Now Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam, and to the princes of Judah, who were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to them, &#8220;Thus says Yahweh, &#8216;You have forsaken me, therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.&#8217;&#8221;</span></span></div><div class="p"><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="2CH.12.5"><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="2CH.12.6"><span class="label">6</span><span class="content">Then the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, &#8220;Yahweh is righteous.&#8221;</span></span></div><div class="p"><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="2CH.12.6"><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v7" data-usfm="2CH.12.7"><span class="label">7</span><span class="content">When Yahweh saw that they humbled themselves, the word of Yahweh came to Shemaiah, saying, &#8220;They have humbled themselves.
