and made yourself a name, as in this day; </span></span><span class="verse v21" data-usfm="JER.32.21"><span class="label">21</span><span class="content">and brought forth your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great terror;

for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, says Yahweh. </span></span><span class="verse v31" data-usfm="JER.32.31"><span class="label">31</span><span class="content">For this city has been to me a provocation of my anger and of my wrath from the day that they built it even to this day; that I should remove it from before my face, </span></span><span class="verse v32" data-usfm="JER.32.32"><span class="label">32</span><span class="content">because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. </span></span><span class="verse v33" data-usfm="JER.32.33"><span class="label">33</span><span class="content">They have turned to me the back, and not the face: and though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not listened to receive instruction. </span></span><span class="verse v34" data-usfm="JER.32.34"><span class="label">34</span><span class="content">But they set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to defile it. </span></span><span class="verse v35" data-usfm="JER.32.35"><span class="label">35</span><span class="content">They built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through fire to Molech; which I didn&#8217;t command them, neither did it come into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin. </span></span><span class="verse v36" data-usfm="JER.32.36"><span class="label">36</span><span class="content">Now therefore thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, concerning this city, about which you say, It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence: </span></span><span class="verse v37" data-usfm="JER.32.37"><span class="label">37</span><span class="content">Behold, I will gather them out of all the countries, where I have driven them in my anger, and in my wrath, and in great indignation;

and I will put my fear in their hearts, that they may not depart from me. </span></span><span class="verse v41" data-usfm="JER.32.41"><span class="label">41</span><span class="content">Yes, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul. </span></span><span class="verse v42" data-usfm="JER.32.42"><span class="label">42</span><span class="content">For thus says Yahweh: Like as I have brought all this great evil on this people, so will I bring on them all the good that I have promised them. </span></span><span class="verse v43" data-usfm="JER.32.43"><span class="label">43</span><span class="content">Fields shall be bought in this land, about which you say, It is desolate, without man or animal; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans. </span></span><span class="verse v44" data-usfm="JER.32.44"><span class="label">44</span><span class="content">Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe the deeds, and seal them, and call witnesses, in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the hill country, and in the cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the South: for I will cause their captivity to return, says Yahweh.</span></span></div>
