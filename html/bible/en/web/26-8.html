So I lifted up my eyes the way toward the north, and see, northward of the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry. </span></span><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="EZK.8.6"><span class="label">6</span><span class="content">He said to me, Son of man, do you see what they do? even the great abominations that the house of Israel do commit here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary? But you shall again see yet other great abominations. </span></span><span class="verse v7" data-usfm="EZK.8.7"><span class="label">7</span><span class="content">He brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold, a hole in the wall. </span></span><span class="verse v8" data-usfm="EZK.8.8"><span class="label">8</span><span class="content">Then he said to me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and when I had dug in the wall, behold, a door. </span></span><span class="verse v9" data-usfm="EZK.8.9"><span class="label">9</span><span class="content">He said to me, Go in, and see the wicked abominations that they do here. </span></span><span class="verse v10" data-usfm="EZK.8.10"><span class="label">10</span><span class="content">So I went in and saw; and see, every form of creeping things, and abominable animals, and all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed around on the wall. </span></span><span class="verse v11" data-usfm="EZK.8.11"><span class="label">11</span><span class="content">There stood before them seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel; and in their midst stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, every man with his censer in his hand; and the odor of the cloud of incense went up. </span></span><span class="verse v12" data-usfm="EZK.8.12"><span class="label">12</span><span class="content">Then he said to me, Son of man, have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in his rooms of imagery? for they say, Yahweh doesn&#8217;t see us; Yahweh has forsaken the land. </span></span><span class="verse v13" data-usfm="EZK.8.13"><span class="label">13</span><span class="content">He said also to me, You shall again see yet other great abominations which they do. </span></span><span class="verse v14" data-usfm="EZK.8.14"><span class="label">14</span><span class="content">Then he brought me to the door of the gate of Yahweh&#8217;s house which was toward the north; and see, there sat the women weeping for Tammuz. </span></span><span class="verse v15" data-usfm="EZK.8.15"><span class="label">15</span><span class="content">Then he said to me, Have you seen this, son of man? You shall again see yet greater abominations than these. </span></span><span class="verse v16" data-usfm="EZK.8.16"><span class="label">16</span><span class="content">He brought me into the inner court of Yahweh&#8217;s house; and see, at the door of Yahweh&#8217;s temple, between the porch and the altar, were about twenty-five men, with their backs toward Yahweh&#8217;s temple, and their faces toward the east; and they were worshipping the sun toward the east. </span></span><span class="verse v17" data-usfm="EZK.8.17"><span class="label">17</span><span class="content">Then he said to me, Have you seen this, son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here? for they have filled the land with violence, and have turned again to provoke me to anger: and behold, they put the branch to their nose. </span></span><span class="verse v18" data-usfm="EZK.8.18"><span class="label">18</span><span class="content">Therefore will I also deal in wrath; my eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity; and though they cry in my ears with a loud voice, yet will I not hear them.</span></span></div>
