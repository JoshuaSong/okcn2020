Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up. </span></span><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="1CO.8.2"><span class="label">2</span><span class="content">But if anyone thinks that he knows anything, he doesn&#8217;t yet know as he ought to know. </span></span><span class="verse v3" data-usfm="1CO.8.3"><span class="label">3</span><span class="content">But if anyone loves God, the same is known by him. </span></span><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="1CO.8.4"><span class="label">4</span><span class="content">Therefore concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is anything in the world, and that there is no other God but one. </span></span><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="1CO.8.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content">For though there are things that are called &#8220;gods,&#8221; whether in the heavens or on earth; as there are many &#8220;gods&#8221; and many &#8220;lords&#8221;; </span></span><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="1CO.8.6"><span class="label">6</span><span class="content">yet to us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we for him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we live through him. </span></span><span class="verse v7" data-usfm="1CO.8.7"><span class="label">7</span><span class="content">However, that knowledge isn&#8217;t in all men. But some, with consciousness of the idol until now, eat as of a thing sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled. </span></span><span class="verse v8" data-usfm="1CO.8.8"><span class="label">8</span><span class="content">But food will not commend us to God.
