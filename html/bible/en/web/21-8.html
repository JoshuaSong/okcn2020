And who knows the interpretation of a thing? A man&#8217;s wisdom makes his face shine, and the hardness of his face is changed. </span></span><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="ECC.8.2"><span class="label">2</span><span class="content">I say, &#8220;Keep the king&#8217;s command!&#8221; because of the oath to God. </span></span><span class="verse v3" data-usfm="ECC.8.3"><span class="label">3</span><span class="content">Don&#8217;t be hasty to go out of his presence. Don&#8217;t persist in an evil thing, for he does whatever pleases him, </span></span><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="ECC.8.4"><span class="label">4</span><span class="content">for the king&#8217;s word is supreme.
