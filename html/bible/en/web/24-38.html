In the dungeon there was no water, but mire; and Jeremiah sank in the mire. </span></span><span class="verse v7" data-usfm="JER.38.7"><span class="label">7</span><span class="content">Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, a eunuch, who was in the king&#8217;s house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon (the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin), </span></span><span class="verse v8" data-usfm="JER.38.8"><span class="label">8</span><span class="content">Ebedmelech went forth out of the king&#8217;s house, and spoke to the king, saying, </span></span><span class="verse v9" data-usfm="JER.38.9"><span class="label">9</span><span class="content">My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is likely to die in the place where he is, because of the famine; for there is no more bread in the city. </span></span><span class="verse v10" data-usfm="JER.38.10"><span class="label">10</span><span class="content">Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from here thirty men with you, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he dies. </span></span><span class="verse v11" data-usfm="JER.38.11"><span class="label">11</span><span class="content">So Ebedmelech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took there rags and worn-out garments, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah. </span></span><span class="verse v12" data-usfm="JER.38.12"><span class="label">12</span><span class="content">Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, Put now these rags and worn-out garments under your armpits under the cords. Jeremiah did so. </span></span><span class="verse v13" data-usfm="JER.38.13"><span class="label">13</span><span class="content">So they drew up Jeremiah with the cords, and took him up out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard. </span></span><span class="verse v14" data-usfm="JER.38.14"><span class="label">14</span><span class="content">Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet to him into the third entry that is in the house of Yahweh: and the king said to Jeremiah, I will ask you something. Hide nothing from me. </span></span><span class="verse v15" data-usfm="JER.38.15"><span class="label">15</span><span class="content">Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, If I declare it to you, will you not surely put me to death? and if I give you counsel, you will not listen to me. </span></span><span class="verse v16" data-usfm="JER.38.16"><span class="label">16</span><span class="content">So Zedekiah the king swore secretly to Jeremiah, saying, As Yahweh lives, who made us this soul, I will not put you to death, neither will I give you into the hand of these men who seek your life. </span></span><span class="verse v17" data-usfm="JER.38.17"><span class="label">17</span><span class="content">Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Armies, the God of Israel: If you will go forth to the king of Babylon&#8217;s princes, then your soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; and you shall live, and your house. </span></span><span class="verse v18" data-usfm="JER.38.18"><span class="label">18</span><span class="content">But if you will not go forth to the king of Babylon&#8217;s princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and you shall not escape out of their hand. </span></span><span class="verse v19" data-usfm="JER.38.19"><span class="label">19</span><span class="content">Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews who are fallen away to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me. </span></span><span class="verse v20" data-usfm="JER.38.20"><span class="label">20</span><span class="content">But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver you. Obey, I beg you, the voice of Yahweh, in that which I speak to you: so it shall be well with you, and your soul shall live. </span></span><span class="verse v21" data-usfm="JER.38.21"><span class="label">21</span><span class="content">But if you refuse to go forth, this is the word that Yahweh has shown me: </span></span><span class="verse v22" data-usfm="JER.38.22"><span class="label">22</span><span class="content">behold, all the women who are left in the king of Judah&#8217;s house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon&#8217;s princes, and those women shall say, Your familiar friends have set you on, and have prevailed over you. Your feet are sunk in the mire, they have turned away back. </span></span><span class="verse v23" data-usfm="JER.38.23"><span class="label">23</span><span class="content">They shall bring out all your wives and your children to the Chaldeans; and you shall not escape out of their hand, but shall be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and you shall cause this city to be burned with fire. </span></span><span class="verse v24" data-usfm="JER.38.24"><span class="label">24</span><span class="content">Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and you shall not die. </span></span><span class="verse v25" data-usfm="JER.38.25"><span class="label">25</span><span class="content">But if the princes hear that I have talked with you, and they come to you, and tell you, Declare to us now what you have said to the king; don&#8217;t hide it from us, and we will not put you to death; also what the king said to you: </span></span><span class="verse v26" data-usfm="JER.38.26"><span class="label">26</span><span class="content">then you shall tell them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan&#8217;s house, to die there. </span></span><span class="verse v27" data-usfm="JER.38.27"><span class="label">27</span><span class="content">Then came all the princes to Jeremiah, and asked him; and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived. </span></span><span class="verse v28" data-usfm="JER.38.28"><span class="label">28</span><span class="content">So Jeremiah stayed in the court of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was taken.</span></span></div>
