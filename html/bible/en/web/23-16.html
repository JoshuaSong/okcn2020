Execute justice! Make your shade like the night in the midst of the noonday! Hide the outcasts! Don&#8217;t betray the fugitive! </span></span><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="ISA.16.4"><span class="label">4</span><span class="content">Let my outcasts dwell with you! As for Moab, be a hiding place for him from the face of the destroyer. For the extortioner is brought to nothing. Destruction ceases.
