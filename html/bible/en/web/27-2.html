and the wind carried them away, so that no place was found for them: and the stone that struck the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth. </span></span><span class="verse v36" data-usfm="DAN.2.36"><span class="label">36</span><span class="content">This is the dream; and we will tell its interpretation before the king. </span></span><span class="verse v37" data-usfm="DAN.2.37"><span class="label">37</span><span class="content">You, O king, are king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power, and the strength, and the glory; </span></span><span class="verse v38" data-usfm="DAN.2.38"><span class="label">38</span><span class="content">and wherever the children of men dwell, the animals of the field and the birds of the sky has he given into your hand, and has made you to rule over them all: you are the head of gold. </span></span><span class="verse v39" data-usfm="DAN.2.39"><span class="label">39</span><span class="content">After you shall arise another kingdom inferior to you; and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth. </span></span><span class="verse v40" data-usfm="DAN.2.40"><span class="label">40</span><span class="content">The fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron, because iron breaks in pieces and subdues all things; and as iron that crushes all these, shall it break in pieces and crush. </span></span><span class="verse v41" data-usfm="DAN.2.41"><span class="label">41</span><span class="content">Whereas you saw the feet and toes, part of potters&#8217; clay, and part of iron, it shall be a divided kingdom; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, because you saw the iron mixed with miry clay. </span></span><span class="verse v42" data-usfm="DAN.2.42"><span class="label">42</span><span class="content">As the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken. </span></span><span class="verse v43" data-usfm="DAN.2.43"><span class="label">43</span><span class="content">Whereas you saw the iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men; but they shall not cling to one another, even as iron does not mingle with clay. </span></span><span class="verse v44" data-usfm="DAN.2.44"><span class="label">44</span><span class="content">In the days of those kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed, nor shall its sovereignty be left to another people; but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever. </span></span><span class="verse v45" data-usfm="DAN.2.45"><span class="label">45</span><span class="content">Because you saw that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God has made known to the king what shall happen hereafter: and the dream is certain, and its interpretation sure. </span></span><span class="verse v46" data-usfm="DAN.2.46"><span class="label">46</span><span class="content">Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face, and worshiped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an offering and sweet odors to him. </span></span><span class="verse v47" data-usfm="DAN.2.47"><span class="label">47</span><span class="content">The king answered to Daniel, and said, Of a truth your God is the God of gods, and the Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, since you have been able to reveal this secret. </span></span><span class="verse v48" data-usfm="DAN.2.48"><span class="label">48</span><span class="content">Then the king made Daniel great, and gave him many great gifts, and made him to rule over the whole province of Babylon, and to be chief governor over all the wise men of Babylon. </span></span><span class="verse v49" data-usfm="DAN.2.49"><span class="label">49</span><span class="content">Daniel requested of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel was in the gate of the king.</span></span></div>
